**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is an antique-style world map, centered on the Americas, rendered in aged parchment tones with a grid overlay of latitude and longitude lines. The map features hand-drawn cartographic details such as stylized coastlines, decorative script labels (e.g., “Oceano,” “Dios de”), small illustrations of ships and mythical creatures, and a compass rose in the lower-left quadrant. A large, ornate brass compass lies diagonally across the upper-right portion of the map. The compass has a circular casing with intricate engravings, a green-tinted dial with cardinal directions marked in Latin (N, E, S, W), degree markings from 0 to 360, and a golden needle pointing northeast. The compass includes a ring at the top for suspension. The overall color palette is warm, dominated by sepia, gold, and faded green hues, evoking a historical, exploratory aesthetic.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instructions explicitly transform key components:  
- The **map** is to be converted into a **scroll form**, partially unfurled and floating above a stylized ocean → this allows full transformation of the map’s physical form and spatial context.  
- The **compass** is to become a **fictional golden ship’s wheel** with elaborate engravings → this permits complete morphing of the compass object into a new symbolic form.  
- **Miniature explorers** are to be added as silhouettes on the map → these are new elements not present originally.  
- **Typography** and **color scheme** are specified but allow enhancement within original tonality → implies retention of base brown tones, but addition of gold highlights.  
- **Historical routes** are to be marked with vibrant red dotted lines → these are new visual elements to be overlaid.  

Thus, the following elements are **allowed to change**:  
- The **form and structure of the map** (from flat surface to scroll).  
- The **physical identity of the compass** (from navigational instrument to ship’s wheel).  
- The **background scene** (from static parchment to dynamic oceanic setting).  
- **Additional figures** (explorers as silhouettes).  
- **Overlay elements** (routes, text, lighting effects).  

**Allowed Changes List:**  
- Map’s shape and presentation (flat → scroll)  
- Compass’s form (round compass → ship’s wheel)  
- Background environment (static parchment → oceanic stage)  
- Addition of miniature explorer silhouettes  
- Introduction of red dotted route lines  
- Typography and textual overlays  
- Lighting effects (glowing gold lanterns)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
Despite extensive transformations, certain core visual elements must be preserved to maintain fidelity to the original image’s identity and thematic essence. These include:

1. **Core recognition elements**:  
   - The **distinctive coastline shape of North and South America** is a unique geographic identifier. Even if transformed into a scroll, the recognizable silhouette of the continents must remain intact to preserve the map's identity.  
   - The **overall layout of the map’s gridded coordinate system** (latitude/longitude lines) is a foundational cartographic feature that should be retained in structure or implied in design.  
   - The **presence and style of the original compass rose** in the lower-left corner is a key iconographic detail; though the main compass is replaced, this smaller one may still serve as a reference point.  
   - The **texture and aging effect of the parchment**—including stains, discoloration, and paper grain—is essential to the antique aesthetic and must be preserved in tone and character.

2. **Functional/logical association elements**:  
   - The **relationship between the compass and the map** as tools of navigation is central to the theme. While the compass becomes a ship’s wheel, its **functional role as a directional guide** must be maintained symbolically.  
   - The **orientation of the map** (with North at the top) should logically persist even if the map is rolled, to preserve navigational coherence.

3. **Non-modified element deduction**:  
   - Although the compass changes form, its **golden metallic materiality and engraved ornamentation** should be retained in the new ship’s wheel version to preserve the luxurious, historical feel.  
   - The **original color palette** (sepia, gold, muted green) is required to be "retained" per instruction—this means **base tones must not shift drastically**, even with added highlights.  
   - The **handwritten script labels** (e.g., “Oceano”) and **illustrations of ships** are stylistic markers of the map’s era and should be preserved or referenced in the redesigned scroll.  

**Preservation Targets List:**  
- The **coastline shape of North and South America**  
- The **grid pattern of latitude and longitude lines**  
- The **parchment texture and aging effects** (stains, creases, discoloration)  
- The **original color scheme** (sepia, gold, green)  
- The **presence of handwritten script labels and ship illustrations**  
- The **overall orientation of the map (North up)**  
- The **golden metallic appearance and engraved details** of the compass (to be transferred to the ship’s wheel)

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The distinctive coastline of North and South America, particularly the jagged outline of the Gulf Coast and the tapering shape of Central America, is a core geographical identifier in the original map. If this shape is altered beyond recognition, the map would no longer represent the Americas, undermining its identity. This is a key visual anchor, making it a 3-point question.
    Question: Does the edited image retain the recognizable coastline shape of North and South America, including the Gulf of Mexico and the narrow isthmus of Central America?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The grid of latitude and longitude lines forms the structural backbone of the map. Its presence defines the cartographic nature of the image. Even if the map is transformed into a scroll, the grid must remain visible or implied to maintain the map’s functional integrity. Losing it would make the image lose its navigational purpose, hence a 2-point importance.
    Question: Are the latitude and longitude grid lines still visible or clearly implied in the edited image?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The parchment texture—including its uneven discoloration, stains, and simulated paper grain—is essential to the antique aesthetic. Retaining this texture ensures continuity with the original’s vintage style. It is a defining visual characteristic that distinguishes it from modern maps. Its loss would result in a significant departure from the source, so it is a 2-point element.
    Question: Is the aged parchment texture, including stains and discoloration, preserved in the background of the edited image?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The original color scheme—dominated by sepia, gold, and muted green—is explicitly stated to be retained. Even with added glowing gold highlights, the base colors must remain consistent. Altering the base tones would disrupt the historical authenticity of the scene, making this a critical 2-point criterion.
    Question: Are the original sepia, gold, and green tones preserved as the dominant color palette in the edited image?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The presence of handwritten script labels (e.g., “Oceano”) and ship illustrations is a key stylistic hallmark of historical maps. These elements contribute to the narrative and artistic authenticity. Their removal would strip the image of its period-specific charm and reduce its educational value. Thus, they are important secondary details worth 1 point.
    Question: Are at least two of the original handwritten script labels or ship illustrations visibly present in the edited image?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The compass’s golden metallic sheen and detailed engravings are central to its visual identity. Though it transforms into a ship’s wheel, the material quality and ornamental style must be carried over to maintain consistency. This is a functional and aesthetic bridge between old and new forms, warranting a 2-point weight.
    Question: Does the transformed compass (now a ship’s wheel) retain the golden metallic finish and intricate engraved patterns seen in the original?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The map’s orientation with North at the top is a standard convention in cartography and supports logical interpretation. Even when rolled or repositioned, maintaining this orientation preserves navigational coherence and aligns with viewer expectations. It is a subtle but essential structural element, thus a 1-point detail.
    Question: Is the map oriented such that North remains at the top of the image?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
