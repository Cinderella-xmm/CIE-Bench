      "thinking_process": "The large, fully opened white rose located in the bottom-right quadrant of the image is a core visual anchor due to its size, clarity, and central placement. Its presence defines the focal point of the floral arrangement. Even if stylized, removing or relocating it would fundamentally alter the composition and recognition of the scene. This makes it a high-weight element.",
      "question": "Is there a large, fully bloomed white rose positioned in the bottom-right area of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The pointed arch window with visible tracery is a defining feature of the Gothic architecture in the background. Its unique shape and internal design distinguish the building from generic structures. Removing or distorting it would make the building unrecognizable as a church or cathedral-style edifice, undermining the scene's context. Thus, its preservation is critical.",
      "question": "Is there a pointed arch window with decorative tracery visible on the upper part of the brick building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The corner of the building where two brick walls meet at a right angle is a key structural identifier. It provides depth and orientation cues. Altering its geometry or omitting it would disrupt the architectural integrity and spatial understanding of the scene. This is a crucial compositional element.",
      "question": "Does the building have a visible corner formed by two intersecting brick walls meeting at a right angle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The rose bush includes multiple buds in various stages of opening, including one prominent pink-tipped bud near the center-left. These developmental stages contribute to the naturalistic detail of the plant. Their presence supports authenticity and visual richness. While color may change, their number and placement should be preserved to maintain botanical accuracy.",
      "question": "Are there at least three distinct rose buds visible along the stems, including one with pink tips near the center of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The green leaves attached to the rose stems provide contrast and support the identification of the plant as a rose bush. Their presence is necessary to distinguish it from other flowering plants. While their color may shift to jade hues per instructions, their form and distribution must remain consistent to preserve botanical identity.",
      "question": "Are there dark green, serrated leaves present along the stems of the rose bush?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The overall spatial arrangement — roses in the foreground, building in the background — establishes depth and context. Reversing or flattening this layering would destroy the original scene’s narrative and visual logic. The foreground-background relationship is foundational to the image’s coherence.",
      "question": "Are the roses positioned in front of the brick building, creating a clear foreground-background separation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The vertical buttress or tower-like structure on the left side of the building contributes to its architectural profile. Its presence helps define the building’s scale and style. While it may be stylized, its elimination or misplacement would compromise the building’s identity.",
      "question": "Is there a tall, vertical brick structure (buttress or tower) extending upward on the left side of the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
