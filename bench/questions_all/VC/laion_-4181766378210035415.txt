**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a modern, minimalist bed with a clean white wooden frame. The bed features a rectangular headboard with a simple vertical panel design on the left side. It is positioned horizontally in the center of the frame, facing slightly toward the viewer’s right. The mattress is covered with a plain white fitted sheet. On the left side, two pillows are stacked vertically; both are white with a subtle light blue botanical pattern featuring leaf-like and vine-like motifs. A folded blanket, matching the pillow pattern, lies neatly across the lower half of the bed from the right side. The background is a uniform, neutral gray tone, creating a minimalist studio-like environment. There is no furniture or decoration visible except for a small dark brown rectangular object partially visible in the upper right corner, possibly a nightstand or wall fixture. The lighting is soft and even, casting gentle shadows beneath the bed.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction explicitly states:  
- "Transform the bed into a series of interlocking LEGO bricks." → This indicates the **entire structure of the bed**, including its form and material, can be changed.  
- "Use white and light blue bricks to mimic the original patterns on the bedding." → The **color scheme and pattern** of the bedding (white base with light blue botanical motifs) must be preserved in form, but not necessarily in texture or medium.  
- "Replace the headboard with smooth, curved LEGO pieces for a rounded look." → The **headboard shape** can be altered from angular to curved, so its geometry is allowed to change.  
- "Stack smaller bricks for pillows, enhancing the three-dimensional feel" → The **pillows’ form and function** can be restructured, but their position and number should likely remain consistent.  
- "Position this LEGO creation against the same grayscale background" → The **background environment** must be retained as a neutral gray tone, with no additional elements introduced.  
- "Playful yet structured appearance" → This describes the *style* of the edit, not a visual element to preserve.

Thus, the following are **allowed to change**:  
- The material and construction of the bed (wood → LEGO bricks).  
- The shape of the headboard (rectangular → curved).  
- The physical composition of the pillows (soft fabric → stacked LEGO bricks).  
- The texture and surface quality of the bedding (fabric → brick surfaces).  
- The structural form of the entire bed (solid frame → modular brick assembly).  

However, the **pattern** on the bedding (light blue botanical motifs), **color palette** (white and light blue), **number and arrangement of pillows**, **positioning of the bed in the scene**, and **neutral gray background** are implied to be preserved due to explicit mention in the instructions.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
- Bed frame material (wood → LEGO bricks)  
- Headboard shape (rectangular → curved)  
- Pillow construction (fabric → LEGO bricks)  
- Bedding texture (fabric → brick surface)  
- Structural modularity (solid → interlocking blocks)  
- Surface finish of components (smooth wood → LEGO studs)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
To identify what must remain unchanged, we apply exclusion based on the above allowed changes:

**Core recognition elements:**  
- The **botanical pattern** on the bedding (light blue leaves/vines) is explicitly referenced in the instruction: “mimic the original patterns on the bedding.” This pattern is the key visual identifier distinguishing the bedding from generic white linens. Even though it will be recreated in LEGO form, its **presence, color, and motif type** must be preserved to maintain visual continuity.  
- The **color scheme** (white base with light blue accents) is specified directly and must be retained to match the original aesthetic.  
- The **number and stacking order of pillows** (two, stacked vertically) is implied by the instruction's focus on "stacking smaller bricks for pillows," suggesting preservation of quantity and layout.  
- The **overall layout** of the bed — horizontal orientation, placement in the center-left of the frame — is essential for spatial consistency with the original image and is required by the instruction to retain the "same grayscale background" and positioning.

**Functional/logical association elements:**  
- The **bed’s function as a sleeping unit** is maintained through the presence of a mattress, pillows, and blanket, even if constructed from LEGO. These components must still occupy similar relative positions to preserve logical coherence.  
- The **relationship between the bed and background** — neutral gray, uncluttered space — is explicitly required to be kept. Therefore, the background must remain unchanged in tone and content.

**Non-modified element deduction:**  
After excluding allowed changes, the remaining elements include:  
- The **botanical pattern details** (e.g., leaf shapes, vine curves) — though stylized in LEGO, they must resemble the original.  
- The **color of the pattern** (light blue) — cannot be replaced with another hue.  
- The **position of the folded blanket** (on the right side, covering half the bed) — this is a key compositional detail that should not be moved.  
- The **partial dark brown object in the upper right** — although not described in depth, it appears to be part of the original scene and is not mentioned for removal. Since the instruction says “same grayscale background,” this object may be considered part of the background and thus must be preserved unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Therefore, while the **form** of the bed can change, its **visual identity markers** — pattern, colors, pillow count, blanket position, and background — must remain consistent.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
- Presence and design of the light blue botanical pattern on the bedding  
- White base color of the bedding and bed frame  
- Two stacked pillows on the left side of the bed  
- Folded blanket positioned on the right half of the bed  
- Neutral gray background with no additional elements  
- Partial dark brown rectangular object in the upper right corner  
- Horizontal orientation and central placement of the bed within the frame

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The light blue botanical pattern (featuring leaf and vine motifs) is the defining visual feature of the bedding in the original image. Its presence and design are critical for identifying the specific aesthetic of the scene. If lost or altered in style (e.g., replaced with geometric shapes), the edited version would fail to reflect the original's identity. The instruction explicitly requires mimicking this pattern using LEGO bricks, confirming it as a core retention target. Thus, preserving this pattern is essential and carries the highest weight.
    Question: Is the light blue botanical pattern (leaf and vine motifs) present on the bedding in the LEGO version?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The white base color of the bedding and bed frame is fundamental to the minimalist aesthetic and contrasts with the light blue pattern. Changing it to another color (e.g., beige or gray) would disrupt the visual harmony and deviate from the original. The instruction specifies using white and light blue bricks, indicating the color scheme must be preserved. This is a core identity element tied to the overall design.
    Question: Are the bedding and bed frame rendered in white with light blue accents in the LEGO version?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The two pillows stacked vertically on the left side of the bed are a key compositional element. Their number and arrangement contribute to the balance of the scene. The instruction mentions "stacking smaller bricks for pillows," implying the quantity and layout should be preserved. Removing or altering their number would change the visual narrative and break continuity.
    Question: Are there exactly two pillows stacked vertically on the left side of the bed?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The folded blanket placed on the right half of the bed is a significant spatial marker. Its position helps define the bed's usage and symmetry. The instruction does not suggest moving it, and retaining its location ensures consistency with the original composition. While the texture may change, its placement is crucial for visual alignment.
    Question: Is the blanket folded and positioned on the right half of the bed?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The neutral gray background is explicitly required to remain unchanged per the instruction. It provides the clean, minimal context necessary for the bed to stand out. Any addition of color, texture, or objects would violate the directive to keep the "same grayscale background." This is an important environmental element affecting overall consistency.
    Question: Is the background a uniform neutral gray with no additional textures or elements?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The partial dark brown rectangular object in the upper right corner is a minor but identifiable element in the original image. Although not central, it contributes to the scene’s completeness and spatial awareness. Since the instruction does not mention removing it and requires retaining the same background, this object should remain visible to preserve visual fidelity.
    Question: Is the dark brown rectangular object visible in the upper right corner of the image?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}
{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The horizontal orientation and central placement of the bed ensure proper framing and balance. Altering its position (e.g., tilting or shifting to the side) would disrupt the intended composition. The instruction implies maintaining the original layout, making this a secondary but important structural detail.
    Question: Is the bed positioned horizontally and centered within the frame?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
