      "thinking_process": "The tall, pointed spire with a cross at the apex is the most distinctive feature of the church and serves as its primary identifier. If removed or replaced with another form (e.g., dome or flat roof), the building would no longer be recognizable as this specific church. Its presence and vertical dominance are essential for identity retention. Therefore, this is a core recognition element with a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Is there a tall, pointed spire rising from the center of the church roof, topped with a cross?",

      "thinking_process": "The central arched entrance with a triangular pediment is a key architectural feature that defines the main access point and contributes to the church’s formal symmetry. Its absence or relocation would distort the building's identity and functional layout. This is a critical structural element that must remain in place, making it a high-weight preservation target.",
      "question": "Is there a centrally located arched doorway beneath a triangular pediment on the main façade?",

      "thinking_process": "The red-tiled roof is a defining visual contrast against the light stone walls and contributes significantly to the church’s appearance. While the instruction allows adding gold accents, it does not permit removing or replacing the red tiles. The color and placement of the tiles are integral to the original design and must be preserved even if stylized.",
      "question": "Are the roof surfaces covered with red tiles, particularly on the main gable and side slopes?",

      "thinking_process": "The arched windows are characteristic of the church’s Neo-Romanesque style and appear in multiple rows across the façade. Their shape and arrangement contribute to the building’s rhythm and identity. Changing them to rectangular or removing them would alter the architectural character. They are important but not the sole identifier, so they are assigned a weight of 2.",
      "question": "Are there multiple arched windows visible on the upper levels of the church façade, arranged symmetrically?",

      "thinking_process": "The light-colored stone masonry is the primary material of the church’s exterior and provides the base texture and tone. Even with cartoon-style rendering, the material must remain visually identifiable as stone, not wood or metal. This is a key detail for authenticity and consistency.",
      "question": "Is the main body of the church constructed from light-colored stone blocks or masonry?",

      "thinking_process": "The overall three-part façade—side towers or projections, central nave, and central spire—is a structural signature of the building. Altering this layout (e.g., merging sides or flattening the center) would fundamentally change the architecture. This compositional structure is essential for recognition.",
      "question": "Does the church façade consist of a central section flanked by two symmetrical side sections, with a spire rising from the center?",

      "thinking_process": "The cross at the top of the spire is a religious symbol and a key identifying feature. It distinguishes this church from others and confirms its function. Removing or replacing it would violate both visual and symbolic identity. Even if stylized, it must remain present.",
      "question": "Is there a cross positioned at the very tip of the spire?",
