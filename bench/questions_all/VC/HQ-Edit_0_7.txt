**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a large, vividly colored macaw parrot perched on a moss-covered tree branch in a lush tropical rainforest. The parrot faces slightly to the right, with its head turned toward the viewer, showcasing its bright red plumage on the head and chest, blue and green wing feathers, and long tail feathers with red, blue, and yellow stripes. Its beak is large, curved, and pale gray with black markings near the base. The eye is light yellow with a dark pupil, surrounded by white facial skin. The background features dense foliage, including broad green leaves, ferns, and distant trees, creating a misty, verdant jungle atmosphere. Two additional smaller parrots are visible in the background—one perched on a lower branch and another in mid-flight—both sharing similar coloration but less detailed due to depth. The lighting is soft and diffused, suggesting morning light filtering through the canopy.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction specifies transforming the scene into a **miniature chibi-style parrot diorama within a glass dome**, which implies a complete transformation of scale, style, and framing. However, it explicitly states that certain **details must be retained**:  
- The **parrot sits on a branch encircled by vibrant, oversized leaves** → indicates preservation of the parrot’s posture and interaction with the branch and leaves.  
- **Tiny dew-like crystal beads on leaves** → new element, not present originally.  
- **A minuscule explorer sketching the parrot from another branch** → entirely new character and action.  
- **Dome's base with wood texture and etched tribal patterns** → new structural element.  

The instruction does **not** require retention of the original size, realism, or full-scale environment. It allows for:  
- Style change (realistic → chibi)  
- Scale reduction (full-sized → miniature)  
- Enclosure addition (glass dome)  
- Addition of new characters (explorer)  
- Modification of lighting and perspective for diorama effect  

However, it **does not allow changes** to:  
- The **presence and identity** of the main parrot as a macaw with specific colors and form  
- The **core posture** of the parrot sitting on a branch  
- The **branch structure** and its relationship to the parrot  
- The **vibrant, oversized leaves** surrounding the parrot (implying their visual prominence and color must remain)  
- The **color scheme** of the parrot (red, blue, green, yellow) — since they are described as "vibrant" and central to the scene  

Thus, while the **overall composition, scale, and setting can change**, the **visual identity of the parrot**, its **position relative to the branch**, and the **key environmental elements (leaves, branch)** must retain their **core visual characteristics** to maintain consistency with the original.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
- Overall image scale (from full-size jungle to miniature diorama)  
- Artistic style (realistic → chibi/illustrative)  
- Frame/environment (open jungle → enclosed glass dome)  
- Background density and depth (can be simplified or stylized)  
- Addition of new characters (explorer, crystal beads)  
- Lighting and shadow effects (adjusted for diorama ambiance)  
- Perspective and camera angle (can shift for better view of dome interior)  
- Texture details on non-core elements (e.g., leaf veins, moss patterns) may be altered for stylization  

---

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
We now exclude the allowed changes and identify what **must be preserved** based on:

1. **Core recognition elements**:  
   - The **macaw’s distinctive color pattern** is essential for identification. A red-headed macaw with blue wings and yellow-green accents is iconic; changing these would make it unrecognizable as the same species.  
   - The **posture of the parrot sitting upright on a branch** is central to the composition and narrative. Even in chibi form, this pose must be retained to preserve the original subject’s behavior.  
   - The **branch itself** must remain as a support structure — it is functionally tied to the parrot’s position and cannot be replaced with something else (e.g., a rock or platform).  

2. **Functional/logical association elements**:  
   - The **relationship between the parrot and the branch** is logical: the bird is perched, so the branch must support it. This spatial logic must be preserved even in miniature form.  
   - The **surrounding oversized leaves** are described as “encircling” the parrot — indicating they are part of the immediate environment and visually frame the subject. Their **presence and vibrancy** are required to maintain the jungle theme and visual focus.  

3. **Non-modified element deduction**:  
   - While the **moss on the branch** may be stylized, its **presence** and **green texture** should remain because it contributes to the rainforest authenticity and visual continuity.  
   - The **tail feathers’ length and striped pattern** (red/blue/yellow) are unique to this macaw type and must be preserved for species identification.  
   - The **beak shape and color** (large, curved, pale gray with black base) are key identifiers of macaws and must not be altered.  
   - The **eye color and placement** (yellow iris, white face patch) are distinguishing traits that help identify the species.  

These elements are **not mentioned in the allowed changes list**, so they must be retained. They are **visually present in the original image** and serve as **anchor points** for consistency.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
- The parrot’s red head and chest plumage  
- The blue and green wing feathers with yellow highlights  
- The long tail feathers with red, blue, and yellow stripes  
- The large curved beak with pale gray upper mandible and black lower mandible  
- The yellow eye with dark pupil and white facial skin around it  
- The posture of the parrot sitting upright on a branch  
- The presence of a moss-covered branch supporting the parrot  
- The surrounding oversized, vibrant green leaves encircling the parrot  
- The texture of moss on the branch (green, fuzzy appearance)  
- The position of the parrot facing slightly right with head turned toward viewer
