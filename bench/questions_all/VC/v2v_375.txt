Description of reference image: The subject is a classical oil painting depicting a grand 18th-century European scene featuring four individuals and a horse-drawn carriage. In the foreground, a man in a dark blue military-style coat with gold trim, white lace cuffs, tan breeches, and a black tricorn hat walks beside the carriage, holding a riding crop. He has powdered white hair and a serious expression. Behind him, a brown horse with a bridle and harness pulls an ornate golden carriage with intricate gilded carvings, red velvet curtains, and large wooden wheels with visible spokes. On the carriage’s driver's seat sits another man in a similar dark blue coat with gold embroidery, wearing a black tricorn hat, white stockings, and black shoes; he holds the reins and looks forward. Inside the carriage, two figures are seated: a woman on the left wearing a light blue dress with white lace detailing, her powdered hair styled in an elaborate updo adorned with a small blue tiara or headpiece, and a man on the right in a rich red coat with gold trim, white cravat, and powdered wig. The background features a pastoral landscape with trees, greenery, and a soft sky with scattered clouds. The overall composition emphasizes symmetry, elegance, and historical authenticity, with detailed rendering of fabrics, textures, and facial expressions.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions to determine what can be changed. The instruction explicitly states that the two individuals (the couple inside the carriage) should be transformed into chibi-style cartoon characters with a 3D appearance and dressed in traditional Chinese wedding attire. This means their form, clothing, and style are fully replaceable. The instruction also specifies altering the backdrop to a ruby-red color with a "囍" paper-cut design, indicating the background environment is to be replaced entirely. However, no mention is made of changing the other two individuals (the coachman and the walking attendant), nor the horse, the carriage structure, or the original setting. Therefore, these elements are not permitted to change unless implied by context. Since the transformation applies only to the couple, all other visual components—such as the horse, the carriage, the coachman, the walking attendant, and the original landscape—are outside the scope of modification and must remain unchanged. Additionally, functional relationships such as the position of the coachman on the seat, the walking attendant beside the horse, and the horse pulling the carriage must be preserved for logical coherence. Any alteration to these would disrupt the narrative and spatial logic of the scene.

Allowed Changes List:
- The two individuals inside the carriage (male and female) may be transformed into chibi-style cartoon characters.
- Their clothing may be replaced with traditional Chinese wedding attire (red changpao/magua, xiuhe gown, zhuangyuan hat, phoenix crown).
- The background may be replaced with a ruby-red backdrop featuring a "囍" paper-cut design.
- The artistic style of the two individuals may shift from realistic to 3D chibi cartoon.
- Facial features, proportions, and poses of the two individuals may be altered to fit chibi aesthetics.

Step 2 - Determine the elements that should remain unchanged

Thinking process:
Core recognition elements: The original image is a historically themed painting with distinct visual markers. The key identity features include the ornate golden carriage with its specific gilded patterns, the red velvet drapes, the large wooden wheels with visible spokes, the brown horse with bridle and harness, and the two men in period-specific attire (dark blue coats with gold trim, tricorn hats, powdered wigs). These are essential for identifying the scene as a historical European aristocratic procession. Changing any of these would fundamentally alter the nature of the image and misrepresent the original context.

Functional/logical association elements: The spatial relationships are critical. The horse must remain harnessed to the carriage, the coachman must remain seated on the driver’s seat holding the reins, and the walking attendant must remain beside the horse holding a riding crop. These positions define the function of each figure and maintain the narrative logic of the scene. If the coachman were moved or the horse detached, the scene would lose its coherence.

Non-modified element deduction: After excluding the two individuals inside the carriage (who are explicitly allowed to be changed), all other elements—such as the horse, the carriage structure, the coachman, the walking attendant, and the background landscape—are not mentioned in the editing instructions as being modifiable. Therefore, they must be retained. Even minor details like the texture of the horse’s coat, the pattern of the carriage’s gilding, the fabric folds of the men’s coats, and the tree line in the background must remain consistent with the original image to preserve visual fidelity.

Preservation Targets List:
- The brown horse with bridle and harness
- The ornate golden carriage with red velvet curtains and gilded carvings
- The coachman seated on the driver’s seat holding the reins
- The walking attendant in dark blue coat and tricorn hat holding a riding crop
- The large wooden wheels with visible spokes
- The pastoral background with trees and sky
- The positioning of all figures relative to the carriage and horse
- The texture and color of the carriage’s gilding and fabric
- The facial features and attire of the coachman and walking attendant (excluding the two inside the carriage)

Q1:  
Thinking process: The brown horse with its bridle and harness is a core visual element of the original image. Its presence and specific features—such as the color of the coat, the shape of the ears, the placement of the bridle, and the harness straps—are essential for identifying the scene as a horse-drawn carriage procession. Removing or altering this horse would destroy the fundamental transportation mechanism of the scene and make it unrecognizable. This is a key identity feature, hence weighted at 3 points.  
Question: Is the brown horse with bridle and harness present in the same position and configuration as in the original image?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The ornate golden carriage with its distinctive gilded carvings and red velvet curtains is a central icon of the image. The specific design of the gilding, the curvature of the roof, and the red drapes are unique identifiers of the carriage’s opulence and historical context. Altering these would change the character of the vehicle and misrepresent the original artwork. This is a core structural element, thus weighted at 3 points.  
Question: Are the gilded carvings and red velvet curtains of the carriage preserved in their original form and position?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The coachman seated on the driver’s seat holding the reins is a functional and narrative anchor. His position, posture, and grip on the reins are essential for maintaining the logic of the scene. If he were removed or repositioned, the action of driving the carriage would be lost. This is a key functional element, so it is weighted at 3 points.  
Question: Is the coachman seated on the driver’s seat with his hands on the reins as in the original image?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The walking attendant in the dark blue coat and tricorn hat, holding a riding crop, is a secondary but identifiable figure. His attire, pose, and location beside the horse contribute to the narrative completeness of the scene. While not the main focus, his presence supports the realism and historical accuracy. This is an important detail element, so it is weighted at 2 points.  
Question: Is the walking attendant in the dark blue coat and tricorn hat positioned beside the horse, holding a riding crop?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The large wooden wheels with visible spokes are structural components of the carriage. Their size, shape, and arrangement are consistent with historical carriages and help identify the vehicle type. Altering them would affect the mechanical plausibility of the scene. This is a key structural detail, so it is weighted at 2 points.  
Question: Are the large wooden wheels with visible spokes preserved in their original form and position?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The pastoral background with trees and sky provides environmental context. While not the focal point, the presence of the tree line and sky helps establish the outdoor setting. Removing or replacing it without preserving the general layout would disrupt the scene’s atmosphere. This is a minor but coherent environmental element, so it is weighted at 1 point.  
Question: Is the background featuring trees and a sky with clouds preserved in its original composition?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The texture and color of the carriage’s gilding and fabric are essential for maintaining the visual richness and historical authenticity. The gold leaf patterns and red velvet drapes are specific to the original painting and contribute to its aesthetic value. Losing these textures would diminish the image’s fidelity. This is a detail-level element, so it is weighted at 1 point.  
Question: Are the gold leaf patterns and red velvet textures of the carriage preserved in their original appearance?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
