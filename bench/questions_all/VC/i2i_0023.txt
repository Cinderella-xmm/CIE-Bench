### Description of reference image:
The subject is a young boy wearing a green T-shirt with cartoon characters printed on it, surrounded by four birds perched on him. The birds include a colorful macaw, a white cockatoo, a yellow canary, and a small blue parakeet. The boy has short hair and is positioned centrally against a plain brownish wall. There is visible furniture and decorative items partially shown in the background.

### Thinking process:

#### Allowed Changes List:
1. Convert the photo into a minimalist flat illustration style with block colors for skin tones and feathers.
2. Remove the background entirely.
3. Enlarge the boy’s head proportionally while shrinking the birds for a balanced composition.
4. Add a thick white outline, with a transparent background.

#### Preservation Targets List:
1. **Core Recognition Elements:** Retain the boy’s facial features, the number and types of birds he is interacting with, and their relative positions.
2. **Functional/Logical Association Elements:** Ensure that the birds appear to perch naturally on the boy without distortion.
3. **Visual Coherence Elements:** Keep the layout of the birds around the boy, including the macaw on his shoulder, the cockatoo on his arm, the canary on his head, and the parakeet near his side.
