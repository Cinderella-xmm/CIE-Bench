      "thinking_process": "The white powdered wig is a defining feature of 18th-century elite figures like George Washington. Its presence and distinctive curled style are key to recognizing the historical context and identity of the subject. Even though the instruction allows modification of the hat with goggles, the wig itself is not mentioned for replacement. Retaining the wig ensures continuity between the original and transformed versions, anchoring the character in his historical roots. If the wig were completely removed or replaced, the figure would lose its identifiable link to the original subject, making it difficult to recognize as a reimagining of Washington. Thus, it is a core identity feature and must be preserved.",
      "question": "Is the white powdered wig with tightly curled sides still present on the figure's head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The tricorne hat is an iconic symbol associated with the naval officer persona. Although the instruction specifies adding goggles to it, this implies the hat itself remains structurally intact. The hat’s shape — specifically its three-cornered silhouette with gold trim — is essential for maintaining visual continuity with the original image. Changing its form would break the connection between the old and new versions. Since the instruction modifies it rather than replaces it, the base shape must be preserved.",
      "question": "Does the figure wear a tricorne hat with a dark blue base and gold trim around the brim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The right hand is shown holding a bell in the original image. While the bell is to be replaced with a chronometer, the hand's position — extended forward, fingers curled around an object — is a critical compositional element. Preserving this gesture maintains the figure’s posture and balance. Changing the hand’s position would disrupt the overall stance and suggest a different action or intent. Therefore, the spatial orientation of the right hand must be retained even if the object changes.",
      "question": "Is the right hand extended forward, gripping an object with the thumb and fingers wrapped around it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The left hand rests near the body, contributing to the formal and balanced pose. This posture is consistent with historical portraiture and helps establish the figure’s dignified demeanor. Even though the object in the right hand changes, the left hand’s position remains unchanged unless specified. Altering it would unbalance the composition and deviate from the original stance. Hence, its position is important for visual coherence.",
      "question": "Is the left hand positioned near the lower torso, palm facing inward or downward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The facial features — particularly the prominent nose, high cheekbones, and defined jawline — are key identifiers of George Washington. These features distinguish him from other historical figures and are central to his public recognition. Although the transformation may involve stylistic updates (like steampunk aesthetics), the underlying facial structure should remain consistent to preserve identity. Losing these features would result in a completely different person, undermining the purpose of a transformation rooted in the original.",
      "question": "Are the facial features including the straight nose, deep-set eyes, and strong jawline still visible and consistent with the original depiction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The three-quarter stance — where the figure faces slightly to the right while the body is angled toward the viewer — is a classic portrait pose used to convey both dignity and approachability. This specific orientation is not mentioned for change, and altering it would fundamentally shift the composition. Maintaining this stance ensures that the transformation respects the original artistic framing and keeps the figure recognizable in terms of posture.",
      "question": "Is the figure positioned in a three-quarter view, facing slightly to the right with the body angled toward the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
