### Step 1 - Analyze Allowed Changes

**Description of Reference Image:**  
The subject is a pink smartphone lying on a neatly arranged bed with beige bedding. The phone has a dual-camera setup on the top left corner of its back panel. The bed consists of a pillow and folded blankets, creating a soft and minimalistic background. The lighting is soft and natural, emphasizing the phone's color and design.

**Thinking Process:**  
The instructions specify transforming the phone into a Q-style chibi-inspired 3D character while retaining its design elements and color scheme. The scene is replaced with a solid background, and the phone's physical form is altered significantly. However, the phone's iconic design features must be preserved in the character design.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
- The phone's physical form can be transformed into a chibi character.
- The scene can be entirely replaced with a solid background.
- The aspect ratio is fixed at 9:16.
- The layout includes header text and sections for the full-body illustration and breakdown of clothing/accessories.

### Step 2 - Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged

**Thinking Process:**  
Core recognition elements include the phone's color, camera setup, and overall design aesthetics. Functional/logical associations involve maintaining the phone's design elements in the character's appearance. Remaining elements like the phone's color and camera placement should be retained for visual coherence.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
- The phone's pink color scheme.
- The dual-camera setup and its position on the character.
- The overall sleek and modern design aesthetic of the phone.
