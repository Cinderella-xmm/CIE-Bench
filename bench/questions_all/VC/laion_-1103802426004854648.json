      "thinking_process": "The seahorse’s silhouette—specifically its curved body, upright head, and downward-curving tail—is the core identity feature that distinguishes it from other animals or toys. Changing this would make it unrecognizable as a seahorse. Even in glass form, the shape must remain identical to preserve identity. This is a 3-point element because it defines the subject’s nature.",
      "question": "Is the seahorse’s body shaped with a curved neck leading to a downward-curving tail, forming a recognizable seahorse silhouette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The music note within the heart on the belly is a functional identifier indicating the toy plays music. Although the instruction says to “etch” it instead of print, the symbol must still be present and located centrally on the belly. Losing this would remove the key functional clue and misrepresent the object’s purpose. This is a 3-point element due to its functional significance and iconicity.",
      "question": "Is there a music note symbol located within a heart shape on the central yellow belly section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The bow on top of the head is a distinctive decorative feature that contributes to the toy’s character and charm. While the material changes from satin to glass, its position and form (a looped ribbon-like structure) must remain unchanged to preserve visual continuity. This is a 2-point element because it is a key accessory defining the toy’s appearance.",
      "question": "Is there a ribbon-like bow positioned at the top of the seahorse’s head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The two fins on the sides of the body are anatomically significant and visually balanced. Their presence and lateral placement near the midsection are necessary for maintaining the seahorse’s natural form. Even if made of glass, their count and position must remain to ensure correct identification. This is a 2-point element due to its structural importance.",
      "question": "Are there exactly two fins positioned on the sides of the seahorse’s body, near the midsection?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The eyes are critical facial features that give the toy its expressive character. Their large, round, black-with-white-highlight design is a signature trait. Altering their shape or position would change the toy’s personality and recognition. This is a 2-point element because it affects both identity and emotional appeal.",
      "question": "Are the eyes large, round, black with white highlights, and placed symmetrically on the face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The belly is a central component, both visually and functionally. Its position in the middle of the body and its larger size relative to the head and tail are important for balance and identifying the toy’s interactive area. Even if transformed into glass, its central location and proportional size must be preserved. This is a 1-point element because it supports overall structure but is less distinct than other features.",
      "question": "Is the yellow belly section located centrally on the body and larger than the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
