### Step 1 - Analyzing Allowed Changes

#### Description of Reference Image:
The subject is a modern bathroom sink area with a central focus on a large circular mirror with an illuminated frame. The mirror reflects the interior's dark walls and ceiling lights. Below the mirror, there is a sleek, black vanity cabinet with a white countertop, housing a rectangular sink with a black faucet. A vase with delicate branches of flowers sits atop the counter. The walls are clad in light marble tiles with subtle veining, and there are wall-mounted sconce lights flanking the mirror. A black trash bin is positioned to the left, and a window with a dark frame occupies the right side of the image.

#### Thinking Process:
The instructions specify adding a golden butterfly above the mirror while requiring consistency with lighting and environment. Therefore:

- **Allowed Changes**: The presence and appearance of a new subject (golden butterfly) above the mirror, ensuring it blends with the lighting and environment.
- **Not Allowed Changes**: Any alteration to the existing elements apart from introducing the butterfly.

#### Allowed Changes List:
- Addition of a golden butterfly above the mirror with proper lighting and environmental consistency.

### Step 2 - Determining Elements That Should Remain Unchanged

#### Thinking Process:
- **Core Recognition Elements**: The circular mirror, black vanity, marble wall tiles, window with dark frame, and vase with flowers are defining features of this bathroom setting. Changing them would alter its identity.
- **Functional/Logical Association Elements**: The mirrorâ€™s reflective properties, placement of vanity relative to the mirror, and the relative positions of the wall sconces and window must remain intact for logical consistency.
- **Remaining Elements**: Details like the black trash bin, the specific type of flowers, and the faucet design contribute to visual coherence and should be retained.

#### Preservation Targets List:
- Circular mirror with illuminated frame
- Black vanity with white countertop and sink
- Light marble wall tiles with veining
- Wall sconces and their positions
- Window with dark frame and natural light
- Black trash bin and vase with delicate branches of flowers
