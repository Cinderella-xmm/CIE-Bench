**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a heart-shaped wooden board placed on a dark brown wooden plank surface. The board is filled with an assortment of fresh, whole food items arranged in a visually balanced composition. At the top left are blueberries and strawberries, followed by raspberries and half an avocado. Below them are chickpeas, rolled oats, and rice grains. In the center are mushrooms (white and brown), garlic bulbs, ginger root, and a bundle of asparagus tied with twine. To the right are a red onion, broccoli florets, red bell peppers (one large and two smaller ones), cherry tomatoes (red and yellow), and a large red tomato. The overall arrangement forms a complete heart shape, with each food item clearly distinguishable by color, texture, and form. The background consists of vertical dark wood planks with visible grain patterns and natural knots.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction explicitly states:  
- "Convert the heart-shaped board of produce into a vibrant LEGO mosaic." → This indicates that the **form** of the food items and board will be transformed from real objects to LEGO bricks.  
- "Use multicolored LEGO bricks, varying sizes to match different food textures" → Implies that **texture simulation** via brick size and shape will replace actual textures.  
- "Structure each item with distinct borders" → Suggests that individual food items should remain **visually separable**, even if stylized.  
- "Keep the heart shape intact" → The **overall silhouette** of the heart must be preserved.  
- "Place the LEGO piece on a neutral gray base" → The **background** changes from wooden planks to a gray base; thus, the original scene is replaced.  
- No mention of retaining specific colors, quantities, or exact positions — only the **arrangement logic** and **heart shape** are required.

Thus, the **subject’s physical form** (real food) can be changed to LEGO representation, but the **identity and layout** of each food item must be preserved in terms of **position, shape, and relative placement** within the heart. The **heart shape** and **item identities** are not allowed to change in form, only in material.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
- The **material** of all food items (from real produce to LEGO bricks)  
- The **texture** of each food (e.g., smooth avocado → smooth LEGO bricks)  
- The **color** of each food (though likely preserved for recognition, not specified as changeable)  
- The **surface** of the board (wood → LEGO structure)  
- The **background** (dark wooden planks → neutral gray base)  
- The **medium** (photographic realism → pixelated LEGO mosaic)  
- The **style** (naturalistic → playful, blocky)  

---

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
We now determine what **must remain unchanged** based on exclusion from the allowed changes and core identity logic.

**Core recognition elements:**  
- The **heart shape** of the board is central to the image's symbolic meaning and visual identity. The instruction says “keep the heart shape intact,” so it **must be preserved**. It is a key identifier of the composition.  
- Each **food item’s position and identity** must be retained because the instruction refers to "each item" being structured with borders. Even though they become LEGO, their **spatial relationships** and **identifiability** are essential for coherence. For example, the avocado must still be at the top-left, near berries, and the broccoli must be on the lower-right.  
- The **relative arrangement** of items (e.g., asparagus tied together, garlic beside onion, mushrooms grouped) must be preserved to maintain logical grouping and visual balance.  

**Functional/logical association elements:**  
- The **grouping logic** of foods (e.g., berries clustered together, vegetables grouped) reflects dietary themes. These groupings support the concept of healthy eating and must be preserved to retain the message.  
- The **tied bundle of asparagus** is a functional detail—its binding implies preparation and care. This detail adds authenticity and should be retained even if made of LEGO.  
- The **half-cut avocado** must remain halved, not whole, because this is a key visual feature distinguishing it from other items.  

**Non-modified element deduction:**  
- All **specific food types** (e.g., blueberries vs. raspberries, red onion vs. garlic) must be **distinguishable** even in LEGO form. Their **shape, color, and placement** must align with the original.  
- The **presence** of each food item (no substitutions like replacing broccoli with cauliflower) must be maintained unless stated otherwise.  
- The **number** of certain items (e.g., three mushrooms, one red pepper) should be preserved to ensure fidelity.  

Thus, while the **material** and **texture** can change, the **identity, shape, position, and count** of each food item and the **heart shape** must remain.

---

**Preservation Targets List:**  
- The **heart-shaped outline** of the board  
- The **position and identity** of each food item (e.g., avocado at top-left, broccoli at bottom-right)  
- The **half-cut avocado** (not whole)  
- The **tied bundle of asparagus**  
- The **clustered berries** (blueberries, strawberries, raspberries)  
- The **distinct bordering** of each food item (as per instruction)  
- The **relative spatial arrangement** of food groups (vegetables, fruits, grains, etc.)  
- The **presence of specific items**: red onion, garlic, ginger, mushrooms, tomatoes, peppers, etc.

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The heart shape is the central symbolic and structural element of the image. The instruction explicitly requires keeping the heart shape intact, making it a core identity feature. If the shape is altered (e.g., oval or circular), the image loses its thematic meaning and visual coherence. Therefore, preserving the heart shape is critical for recognition.
    Question: Is the overall shape of the food arrangement a perfect heart?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The half-cut avocado is a distinctive feature that separates it from other round fruits. Its cut side facing up is a key visual identifier. If it were whole or positioned differently, it would be misidentified. Since the instruction mentions simulating textures, the cut must still be represented in LEGO form, so its presence and orientation must be preserved.
    Question: Is the avocado shown as half-cut with the pit cavity visible?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The tied bundle of asparagus is a unique detail indicating preparation and grouping. It is visually distinct due to the twine binding. Losing this would make the asparagus indistinguishable from loose stalks. Even in LEGO form, the binding must be represented to preserve this detail.
    Question: Are the asparagus stalks bundled together with a visible twine-like structure?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The cluster of berries (blueberries, strawberries, raspberries) at the top-left is a key compositional element. Their proximity and color contrast create a focal point. Changing their grouping or replacing any type (e.g., swapping raspberries for blackberries) would alter the visual balance and identity of the arrangement. Thus, their presence and grouping must be preserved.
    Question: Are blueberries, strawberries, and raspberries grouped together at the top-left of the heart?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The red onion is located next to the garlic and broccoli, forming a vegetable cluster. Its deep purple color and spherical shape are distinctive. Replacing it with another bulb (e.g., shallot) or moving it would disrupt the intended grouping and visual logic. Therefore, its presence and position are important.
    Question: Is there a single red onion positioned near the broccoli and garlic?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The bundle of white mushrooms is centrally located and includes both small and larger caps. Their number and clustering are part of the food diversity theme. Reducing or increasing their count would affect the balance. Since the instruction specifies structuring each item with borders, their quantity and grouping must be preserved.
    Question: Are there at least three white mushrooms grouped together near the center?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}
{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The large red bell pepper is a prominent element at the bottom-right. Its size and color contrast make it stand out. Moving it or replacing it with a green pepper would alter the visual hierarchy. Its presence is necessary for completing the vegetable section.
    Question: Is there a large red bell pepper at the bottom-right of the heart?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q8: 
    Thinking process: The wooden background is replaced by a neutral gray base according to instructions. However, the **original wooden planks** are not required to be preserved. Therefore, this is not a retention target. But the **gray base** becomes the new scene element. Since the instruction specifies the new base, we do not need to assess the original background.
    Question: Is the background a neutral gray surface?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
