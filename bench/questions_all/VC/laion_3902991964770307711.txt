**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

Description of reference image:  
The subject is a three-armed silver candelabra with a central vertical stem and two curved arms extending symmetrically to the left and right, each ending in a cup-shaped candle holder. The base is circular and flared, featuring a decorative beaded rim. The central stem tapers slightly toward the top and is segmented by ornamental bands, including a raised ring near the base and another just below the central candle holder. The candle holders are cup-shaped with a ridged edge and sit atop small platforms connected by smooth, gently curved metal arms. The entire object is made of polished silver or silver-plated metal, reflecting light with high sheen and clear highlights. The background is a neutral, uniform light gray, providing no distractions and emphasizing the reflective surface of the candelabra. The lighting is soft and diffused, creating subtle reflections and shadows that accentuate the form and contours.

Thinking process:  
The editing instruction explicitly states several transformations:
- "Transform the candelabra into a luxury perfume packaging design" → This indicates the **overall function and identity** of the object will change from a candelabra to a perfume bottle.
- "Convert the top portions into elegant tapered glass perfume caps" → The **top candle holders** are to be replaced with glass caps.
- "Replace the metal stems with sleek, seamless gold-finish tubing" → The **metal arms and central stem** are to be changed in material and finish.
- "Emboss a minimalist brand logo at the base" → A new element (logo) is to be added to the base.
- "Overlay the surface with intricate floral-engraved patterns" → New decorative patterns are to be applied across the surface.
- "Position a subtle, elegant script font label on the central tube" → A label is to be added to the central part.

These changes imply that:
- The **form and function** of the object are being redefined.
- The **material**, **color**, and **surface texture** of the main structure are being altered.
- **New elements** (label, logo, engraving) are introduced.
- However, **no mention is made of changing the spatial configuration**—the three-arm structure, symmetry, or overall silhouette is not specified for removal.

Thus, the allowed changes include:
- Material (silver → gold-finish tubing)
- Top sections (candle holders → glass caps)
- Surface decoration (addition of floral engravings)
- Color (silver → gold)
- Functional transformation (candelabra → perfume packaging)
- Addition of branding elements (logo, label)

Allowed Changes List:  
(Specific element 1 that allows for changes): The top candle holders  
(Specific element 2 that allows for changes): The metal arms and central stem (material and finish)  
(Specific element 3 that allows for changes): The surface texture (addition of floral engravings)  
(Specific element 4 that allows for changes): The color and material (silver → gold finish)  
(Specific element 5 that allows for changes): The functional identity (candelabra → perfume packaging)  
(Specific element 6 that allows for changes): Addition of a brand logo and script label

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

Thinking process:  
To determine what must remain unchanged, we apply exclusion based on the above list of allowed changes:

**Core recognition elements**:  
Although the object is being transformed into a perfume packaging, the **three-armed structure** and **symmetrical layout** are not mentioned as being altered. These define the iconic shape of the original candelabra and are essential to maintaining visual continuity with the original form. If the number of arms or their relative positions were changed, the structural identity would be lost. Thus, the **spatial arrangement of the three arms** (central + two side arms) must be preserved.

Additionally, the **overall silhouette and proportion**—including the height of the central stem, the curvature of the arms, and the placement of the candle holders—are not specified for modification. Since the instruction says “transform” rather than “reconfigure,” the **basic outline and balance** should be retained to maintain recognizability of the original form.

**Functional/logical association elements**:  
The original candelabra has a **central vertical support** with **two symmetrical lateral arms** extending outward. This is a standard tri-branched candelabra design. Even though it’s being repurposed, the **structural logic**—a single central column supporting three points—must remain intact to preserve the architectural coherence. Changing the number of arms or their attachment points would break this logic.

**Non-modified element deduction**:  
The **base shape** (circular, flared, with beaded edge) is not mentioned in the instructions as being altered. While the material may change, the **form of the base** is not specified for redesign. Therefore, its **shape and position** should be retained. Similarly, the **relative angles and curves** of the arms are not described as being changed, so their **curved trajectory and symmetry** must remain.

Preservation Targets List:  
(The three-armed structure with one central and two lateral arms)  
(The symmetrical layout of the arms)  
(The circular, flared base with beaded rim)  
(The relative positioning of the arms and central stem)  
(The overall silhouette and proportional balance of the object)

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The three-armed structure is the defining feature of the candelabra. It consists of one central arm and two symmetrical side arms. This configuration is essential for identifying the object as a traditional candelabra. Even if transformed into a perfume bottle, the preservation of this structure ensures continuity with the original form. Removing or altering the number of arms would fundamentally change the object's identity. Therefore, this is a core identity element with a weight of 3 points.
    Question: Does the edited image retain exactly three arms—one central and two lateral—arranged symmetrically?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The symmetry of the arms is a key visual characteristic of the original candelabra. The left and right arms mirror each other in length, curvature, and elevation. This balance contributes to the object's aesthetic and structural integrity. Altering this symmetry would disrupt the visual harmony and make the object unrecognizable as derived from the original. Thus, symmetry is a critical attribute requiring retention, assigning it a weight of 3 points.
    Question: Are the left and right arms symmetrically positioned and shaped relative to the central axis?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The base is a distinctive feature with a circular, flared shape and a beaded edge. This design is unique to the original object and serves both functional and decorative purposes. Although the material may change, the **form of the base** is not specified for alteration. Retaining its shape ensures visual consistency with the original. This is a secondary but identifiable detail that supports recognition, hence a weight of 2 points.
    Question: Is the base circular, flared, and adorned with a beaded or ridged edge?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The central stem is a tall, tapering column that connects the base to the top arms. Its height and gradual narrowing are key to the object’s silhouette. The instruction does not specify altering its form, only replacing its material. Therefore, the **vertical shaft’s shape and position** must remain. This preserves the structural logic of the object. As a foundational component, it carries a weight of 2 points.
    Question: Does the central stem remain a tall, tapering vertical shaft connecting the base to the top arms?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The arms extend in smooth, curved arcs from the central stem to the candle holders. Their curvature is consistent and elegant, contributing to the object’s balanced appearance. While the material may change, the **path and shape of the curves** are not mentioned as modifiable. Preserving these curves maintains the original’s fluid motion and proportions. This is a detailed but important aspect of the design, warranting a weight of 1 point.
    Question: Do the arms maintain smooth, curved trajectories from the central stem to the top ends?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
