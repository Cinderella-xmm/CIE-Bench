      "thinking_process": "The multi-tiered gabled roof with sharp angles and overlapping sections is the defining structural feature of a stave church. Its unique layered geometry distinguishes it from other churches. If this shape is lost or simplified, the building cannot be identified as a stave church. Therefore, preserving the exact roof configuration is critical for identity retention.",

      "thinking_process": "The dragon-head finials are iconic Norse architectural symbols, placed at each roof ridge corner. They are not merely decorative but serve as key identifiers of stave churches. Their absence or alteration would fundamentally change the cultural and historical identity of the structure. Hence, their presence and correct positioning are essential.",

      "thinking_process": "The central spire with a Christian cross at the top is a crucial symbolic element, representing the religious transition in Norse architecture. It is a core identifier distinguishing stave churches from purely pagan structures. Removing or replacing the cross would misrepresent the building’s historical function and identity.",
      "question": "Is the central spire topped with a Christian cross still present?",

      "thinking_process": "The dark weathered wooden texture of the exterior is a defining material characteristic of stave churches. It reflects both the construction method and the aging process. Changing the color or material (e.g., to painted or metallic) would undermine the authenticity of the structure, even in miniature form.",
      "question": "Is the dark weathered wooden texture of the exterior walls preserved?",

      "thinking_process": "The symmetrical layout with a raised platform and steps leading to the entrance is a functional and aesthetic hallmark of stave churches. It reflects the building’s orientation and accessibility. Altering this layout would disrupt the architectural logic and reduce recognizability.",
      "question": "Is the symmetrical layout with a raised platform and steps leading to the entrance maintained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The carved wooden details along the eaves and window frames are part of the ornamental tradition of stave churches. These carvings often include interlacing patterns and symbolic motifs. Their presence contributes to the authenticity and artistic value of the structure. Omitting them would result in a loss of cultural detail.",
      "question": "Are the carved wooden details visible along the eaves and window frames?",
