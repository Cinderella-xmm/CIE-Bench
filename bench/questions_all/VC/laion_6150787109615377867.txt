Description of reference image: The subject is a modern, minimalist metal table with a circular tabletop featuring a textured, dimpled pattern resembling a honeycomb or diamond plate design. The tabletop has a polished metallic finish with reflective highlights and rounded edges. A single cylindrical central column extends vertically from the center of the tabletop down to a five-pointed star-shaped base. Each leg of the base is flat and angular, forming a symmetrical cross-like structure with slight tapering toward the ends. At the tip of each leg is a small black rubber foot, providing stability and preventing slipping. The entire structure is made of stainless steel or similar silver-toned metal, giving it a sleek, industrial aesthetic. The background is plain white, with no additional elements or context, emphasizing the object’s form and material.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions that clearly state what can be changed. The instruction says to "transform the metal table into a steampunk-inspired mechanized creature," which means the overall form and function of the object are allowed to change significantly. Specifically:
- “Convert the tabletop into a polished, rotating gear” → the tabletop shape, texture, and purpose can be altered.
- “Morph the table legs into articulated, piston-driven limbs” → the legs’ structure and movement mechanism can be changed.
- “Add steam vents along the central column” → new functional components may be added to the column.
- “Embellish the base with intricate cog patterns and rotating dials” → decorative and mechanical features may be introduced on the base.

These changes indicate that the **form**, **function**, and **aesthetic** of the original table are open to transformation. However, the **original visual identity** of the table — such as its basic geometry, proportions, and material appearance — must still serve as the foundation for transformation, meaning certain core structural and visual elements should remain recognizable even after modification.

Allowed Changes List:
- Shape and surface texture of the tabletop (can become a gear)
- Structure and articulation of the legs (can become piston-driven limbs)
- Function and design of the central column (can include steam vents)
- Base design (can feature cogs and dials)
- Overall mechanical functionality and thematic style (can shift to steampunk)

Step 2 – Determine the elements that should remain unchanged

Thinking process:
Core recognition elements: While the table is being transformed into a mechanized creature, the original object’s **basic silhouette and structural layout** — particularly the **circular tabletop**, **central vertical column**, and **five-legged star base** — are foundational to its identity. These forms are not explicitly stated to be removed or replaced but rather reinterpreted. Therefore, they must be retained in their essential geometric configuration to preserve continuity between the original and edited versions. For example, changing the number of legs or eliminating the central column would fundamentally alter the object's identity as a derived version of the original table.

Functional/logical association elements: The **support relationship** between the tabletop and base via the central column must be preserved. Even if this column becomes a steam conduit or piston shaft, it must still connect the top and bottom in a vertical alignment to maintain logical spatial coherence. Similarly, the **five-pointed base structure** must retain its radial symmetry and support role; otherwise, the transformation loses its basis in the original design.

Non modified element deduction: After excluding the allowed changes (e.g., surface textures, materials, mechanical additions), the following unmentioned visual features must remain:
- The **roundness of the tabletop**
- The **vertical alignment of the central column**
- The **star-shaped base with five legs**
- The **presence of feet at the end of each leg**
- The **overall height and proportion** of the structure

These elements are not mentioned as changeable, and altering them would break the visual link to the original object. They are necessary for maintaining coherence between the source and transformed image.

Preservation Targets List:
- The circular shape of the tabletop
- The single central vertical column connecting the top and base
- The five-pointed star-shaped base structure
- The presence of four or five rubber feet at the ends of the legs
- The general height and scale of the table relative to its components

Q1:  
Thinking process: The circular shape of the tabletop is the most fundamental identifying feature of the original table. It defines the object's primary form and distinguishes it from other types of furniture. Even if transformed into a gear, the circle must remain intact to preserve the original identity. Losing this shape would make the object unrecognizable as a derivation of the original table. This is a core identity element, so it receives a weight of 3 points.  
Question: Is the tabletop still circular in shape?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The central vertical column is a key structural component that connects the tabletop to the base. Its presence maintains the functional logic of a table — a top supported by a central post. Even if modified with steam vents or mechanical parts, the column must remain vertically aligned and singular to preserve the original design's integrity. Changing its number or orientation would disrupt the logical support system. This is a critical functional element, hence a weight of 3 points.  
Question: Does a single vertical column extend from the center of the tabletop to the base?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The five-pointed star-shaped base is a distinctive design feature of the original table. It provides both stability and aesthetic symmetry. Even if transformed into articulated limbs, the base must retain its five-legged radial structure to maintain visual continuity. Altering the number of legs or removing the star pattern would sever the connection to the original object. This is an important structural identifier, thus receiving a weight of 2 points.  
Question: Does the base consist of five symmetrically arranged legs forming a star shape?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The rubber feet at the end of each leg are minor but identifiable details that prevent slipping and protect surfaces. While not core to identity, they are consistent across the original image and contribute to the realism and completeness of the object. Their absence would suggest incomplete transformation or loss of detail. As a secondary detail, it receives a weight of 1 point.  
Question: Are there small black rubber feet at the tip of each leg?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The overall height and proportion of the table — specifically the ratio between the tabletop diameter and the column length — define its scale and usability. Even if mechanical components are added, the relative size of the parts must remain consistent to avoid distorting the original form. This proportionality ensures the transformed object remains visually coherent with the source. It is a structural consistency factor, thus assigned 2 points.  
Question: Is the height of the central column approximately equal to the diameter of the tabletop?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The metallic silver color and reflective surface are defining characteristics of the material used in the original table. While the editing instruction allows for brass and copper accents, the base material must remain visually consistent with stainless steel or similar silver-toned metal. If the entire object were recolored into bronze or gold without retaining any silver elements, it would lose its original material identity. This is a key visual attribute tied to recognition, so it receives a weight of 2 points.  
Question: Is the main body of the table still made of a shiny, silver-colored metal?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2
