      "thinking_process": "The framed painting above the sofa is a distinctive visual anchor in the scene. Its specific content—a pastoral landscape with ducks near water—and the dark wooden frame are unique identifiers of the original environment. Removing or altering this artwork would fundamentally change the setting’s identity and break continuity. Since the instruction does not specify modifying the painting, it must be preserved as a core scene element. This is a key identifier of the original room’s aesthetic and context, making it essential for visual consistency.",

      "thinking_process": "The wall color is a foundational environmental detail. The cream-colored wall serves as a neutral backdrop that contrasts with the brown leather sofa and supports the lighting dynamics. Changing the wall color would alter the overall ambiance and potentially affect how the transformed creature is perceived. Since the instruction does not mention altering the wall, preserving its original hue ensures scene coherence.",

      "thinking_process": "The carpet’s texture and color contribute to the room’s realism and help define the space. The light beige carpet provides contrast to the dark leather and grounds the furniture visually. Altering its appearance would disrupt the balance of the scene. As no modification is instructed, it must remain intact.",

      "thinking_process": "The baseboard molding along the wall’s bottom edge is a minor but important architectural detail. It defines the boundary between wall and floor and adds realism to the interior. Its absence or alteration would create an incomplete or unrealistic room. Since it is not mentioned for change, it must be preserved.",
      "question": "Is there a white baseboard molding running along the bottom of the wall behind the sofa?",

      "thinking_process": "The partial view of the matching leather armchair on the left indicates a coordinated furniture set and reinforces the idea of a lived-in space. Its presence contributes to the sense of continuity and furnishing style. Removing or changing it would imply a different room setup, undermining the original context. Since it is not referenced in the transformation, it must remain.",

      "thinking_process": "The lighting and shadows suggest ambient indoor illumination with soft overhead light casting subtle shadows beneath the sofa. This lighting condition affects how textures and forms are perceived. Preserving the lighting ensures that the transformed creature appears integrated into the original space rather than artificially inserted. Since the instruction does not specify changing the lighting, it must be maintained.",
