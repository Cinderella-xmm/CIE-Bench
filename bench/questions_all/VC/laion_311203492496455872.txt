**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is an elderly man with white, slightly tousled hair, viewed in a three-quarter profile facing right. His facial features include deep-set eyes, prominent cheekbones, a defined nose, and visible wrinkles around the eyes and mouth, indicating age. He is smiling gently, showing upper teeth. He wears a dark formal suit jacket over a light blue checkered dress shirt and a patterned blue tie with subtle geometric designs. A small red insignia (likely a national or organizational pin) is pinned to the left lapel of the jacket. The background is plain, off-white, and featureless, providing high contrast to the subject. The lighting is even and soft, highlighting facial texture and clothing details without harsh shadows.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instructions specify transformative changes to:
- **Hairstyle**: "Transform the visible hairstyle into an exaggerated, swirling cotton candy form with pastel pink and blue hues, emphasizing fluffiness." → This explicitly allows changing the form, color, texture, and volume of the hair.
- **Clothing**: "Convert the clothing into a stylized 3D paper doll outfit, highlighting the suit with a sleek, glossy finish and bold geometric patterns." → This permits altering the material appearance, texture, and design of the suit and shirt.
- **Tie**: "Adjust the tie to be a vibrant, oversized cartoon-style element with bright, contrasting colors." → This authorizes modification of size, shape, color scheme, and style of the tie.
- No mention is made of modifying the **face**, **facial expression**, **skin tone**, **eyes**, **nose**, **mouth**, **ear**, or **overall head structure**, nor is there any instruction about changing the **background**, **pin on lapel**, or **posture**.

Thus, elements directly referenced in the transformation instructions are allowed to change. All other visual components not mentioned must be inferred as potentially preserved unless logically overridden.

**Allowed Changes List:**
- Hairstyle (form, color, texture, volume)
- Suit jacket (material appearance, glossiness, pattern)
- Shirt (texture, pattern, if part of the paper doll effect)
- Tie (size, shape, color, style)
- Overall clothing aesthetic (conversion to stylized 3D paper doll form)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
Core recognition elements:  
- The **identity of the individual** relies on facial features such as the **shape of the nose**, **eye position and shape**, **jawline**, **ear structure**, and **smiling mouth**. These are invariant in human identification. Even with fantastical styling, the face must remain recognizable as the same person. Therefore, **facial structure** (including contours, eye placement, ear shape, and smile line) must be retained.
- The **red insignia on the left lapel** is a distinctive symbolic detail that may indicate nationality, rank, or affiliation. It is not mentioned in the editing instructions, so it should remain unchanged to preserve identity context.
- The **posture and orientation** (three-quarter profile, head turned right) are essential for maintaining spatial consistency and continuity with the original image.

Functional/logical association elements:  
- The **position of the lapel pin** relative to the suit collar and shoulder is functionally tied to how medals or insignias are worn. Moving it would break logical realism unless explicitly repositioned by instruction.
- The **connection between the tie and shirt knot** must remain consistent — even if the tie is enlarged, its attachment point at the collar must still exist to maintain functional logic.

Non-modified element deduction:  
After excluding all elements listed in the allowed changes list, the following remain:
- **Facial features**: Eyes, nose, mouth, ears, skin texture
- **Face shape and expression**
- **Lapel pin presence and location**
- **Posture and head angle**
- **Background simplicity and neutrality**
- **Lighting direction and softness** (implied by shadowing under chin and jaw)

These must be preserved to ensure the edited image remains visually coherent and identifiable as the same subject in the same context.

**Preservation Targets List:**
- Facial structure (including eye shape, nose, ear, jawline)
- Smile and lip curvature
- Position and shape of the ear
- Red insignia on left lapel
- Head orientation (three-quarter view, facing right)
- Background (plain, off-white)
- Lighting quality (soft, even illumination)
- Skin texture and tone
- Neck and collar connection point

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

Q1:  
Thinking process: The **presence and position of the red insignia on the left lapel** is a unique identifying marker. It is not mentioned in the editing instructions and serves as a key symbol of identity or affiliation. If removed or relocated, the image loses contextual authenticity and could misrepresent the subject’s status. Its retention ensures fidelity to the original subject’s identity and official representation. This is a core symbolic element, thus weighted 3 points.  
Question: Is the red circular insignia still present on the left lapel of the suit jacket?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The **shape and position of the ear** are critical anatomical features for facial recognition. Changing its form or location would distort the face beyond recognition. Since the instruction does not mention modifying the ear, it must remain unchanged. This is a core identity element; loss would compromise identification. Weighted 3 points.  
Question: Is the ear clearly visible on the left side of the head in its original anatomical position?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The **facial expression**, particularly the **smile with visible upper teeth**, is a defining emotional cue and recognizable trait. Altering this would change the subject's demeanor and affect recognition. The instruction does not mention modifying facial expression, so it must be preserved. This is a key identity feature, hence 3 points.  
Question: Is the mouth open in a natural smile showing the upper row of teeth?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The **nose shape**, including its bridge and tip, is a primary facial landmark. Any significant alteration would make the face unrecognizable. As no instruction refers to modifying the nose, it must remain intact. This is a core structural feature essential for identity, so weighted 3 points.  
Question: Is the nose retaining its original shape with a distinct bridge and rounded tip?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The **head orientation** (three-quarter profile, facing right) establishes spatial context and posture. Changing this would alter the composition and perception of the subject. Since no instruction mentions repositioning the head, the orientation must be preserved. This is an important scene-related element affecting overall consistency, thus 2 points.  
Question: Is the head turned to the right in a three-quarter profile view?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The **background** is plain and off-white, serving as a neutral backdrop that emphasizes the subject. The instruction does not mention changing the background, so it must remain unchanged to preserve visual focus and context. While not a core identity element, it is crucial for scene coherence and aesthetic balance. Weighted 2 points.  
Question: Is the background uniformly off-white with no additional textures or objects?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The **lighting direction and softness**, evident from the gentle shadows under the chin and along the jawline, contribute to depth and realism. Although not explicitly mentioned, altering lighting would affect facial structure perception. Since no instruction specifies lighting change, it should remain consistent. This is a secondary but important detail for visual coherence, thus 1 point.  
Question: Are the shadows under the chin and along the jawline soft and consistent with even frontal lighting?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q8:  
Thinking process: The **neck-to-collar junction** is a functional connection point between the shirt and suit. Even if the clothing is transformed, this anatomical connection must remain logical. The instruction modifies clothing style but not body structure, so this interface must persist. This is a minor but necessary detail for realism. Weighted 1 point.  
Question: Is the shirt collar properly aligned and connected to the neck beneath the suit jacket?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1
