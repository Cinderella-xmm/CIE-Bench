      "thinking_process": "The central medallion is a core identification feature of the teapot's Baroque design. Its presence, location, and ornamental style define the piece’s aesthetic identity. If removed or relocated, the transformed object would lose its visual lineage to the original. This is a key visual anchor, hence weighted at 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the central floral medallion located on the front center of the body, surrounded by symmetrical scrollwork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The curved spout with its distinctive scroll-like terminal is a unique structural feature that contributes to the teapot’s iconic profile. Even if repurposed as part of a candle holder, its shape and position must be retained to maintain visual consistency with the original. This is a major design element, thus weighted at 2 points.",
      "question": "Does the spout extend from the left side of the body with a curled, scroll-like tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The C-shaped handle with volute detailing is another defining characteristic of the teapot’s ornate design. Its curvature and decorative flourishes are essential to the object’s identity. Altering its shape would break the visual connection to the original. This is a key accessory feature, so weighted at 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the handle on the right side of the body shaped like a C with ornate volute ends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The finial on top of the lid is a small but significant detail that completes the teapot’s vertical symmetry and decorative hierarchy. Although the lid becomes a snuffer, the finial’s presence and form should persist as a nod to the original. This is a minor but identifiable detail, thus weighted at 1 point.",
      "question": "Is there a small decorative finial atop the lid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The four-footed base with decorative supports is a structural element that grounds the teapot visually and physically. Even if the base is now part of a marble stand, the number and style of feet should reflect the original. This maintains spatial integrity and is a secondary but important detail, hence weighted at 1 point.",
      "question": "Are there four ornate feet supporting the base of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The symmetrical arrangement of floral and foliate motifs across the body is a hallmark of the Baroque style in this teapot. While the material may change (metal to glass), the pattern layout must remain consistent to preserve the design language. This is a key visual coherence element, so weighted at 2 points.",
      "question": "Are the floral and foliate patterns arranged symmetrically around the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The overall silhouette of the teapot—rounded body, elevated lid, balanced spout and handle—is fundamental to its recognition. Even when transformed, the proportions and outline should mirror the original to maintain visual continuity. This is a core identity feature, hence weighted at 3 points.",
      "question": "Does the object retain the same overall rounded silhouette with a domed lid and balanced spout and handle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
