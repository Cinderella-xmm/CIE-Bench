### Step 1 - Allowed Changes List

**Description of reference image:** The subject is a horse with a brown coat and a white blaze on its face. The horse is wearing sunglasses with one lens missing, revealing its eye. The background features a sunset with warm orange and pink hues, a rustic barn partially visible on the left, and a grassy field. The horse is positioned in profile, facing slightly towards the camera.

**Thinking process:** The instructions specify transforming the horse into a chibi-style 3D-rendered figurine, changing its form significantly. The scene is also to be replaced with a new setting inside a presentation box, indicating that the original background can be altered. However, certain elements like the horse's core identity and the serene atmosphere should be retained.

- The addition of new elements like the presentation box, window, and decorative details.

Functional/logical elements include the horse's calm demeanor and the rustic barn, which contribute to the serene atmosphere.

**Preservation Targets List:**
