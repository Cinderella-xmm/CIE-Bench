      "thinking_process": "The facial features—specifically the eyes, nose, mouth, and beard—are the primary identifiers of the subject’s identity. In any transformation, especially one involving a deity or sculpture, the face must remain recognizable to preserve the core identity. Loss of these features would make the figure unidentifiable as the original subject. This is a 3-point element due to its critical role in identity recognition.",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the original facial structure, including the eyes, nose, mouth, and full beard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The seated pose with hands resting palms-up on the thighs is a functional and symbolic posture that defines the subject’s demeanor and spiritual state. It is a key compositional element that must remain unchanged to preserve the narrative context. Altering this would fundamentally change the subject’s presentation and disrupt continuity.",
      "question": "Is the subject depicted in the same seated pose with hands resting palms-up on the thighs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The headdress is a distinctive cultural and symbolic object, with a specific crown-like shape and central diamond motif. While its texture may change to marble, its form and placement must remain consistent to maintain visual continuity. Its loss or alteration would undermine the subject’s regal or divine status as established in the original.",
      "question": "Is the headdress present in the same shape and position on the head, with the central diamond motif clearly visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The earrings are prominent accessories that contribute to the subject’s identity and aesthetic. Their position and form (dangling with tassels) are unique to the original image. Even if rendered in stone, their presence and location must be preserved to maintain consistency with the original design.",
      "question": "Are the earrings still present, dangling from the ears in the same position and form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The draped garment at the lower body is a secondary but important detail that completes the subject’s attire and maintains visual balance. While its texture may change, its existence and silhouette must be preserved to avoid visual incompleteness or misrepresentation.",
      "question": "Is the draped garment still present around the lower body, maintaining its original silhouette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The muscular anatomy—particularly the defined abs, pectorals, and arms—is a key feature of the subject’s physicality. Even in a sculptural form, the underlying musculature must be accurately represented to preserve the subject’s strength and presence. Any distortion would compromise the integrity of the original depiction.",
      "question": "Are the defined abdominal muscles, pectorals, and arm musculature still clearly visible and proportionally accurate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The central framing within an arch-like structure is a spatial element that anchors the composition. Although the background is being replaced, the subject must remain centered within a similar arch form to preserve the original spatial logic and symmetry. This is a key scene element that supports the overall coherence.",
      "question": "Is the subject still framed within a central arch-like structure, maintaining the original spatial composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
