      "thinking_process": "The McLaren logo on the hood is the primary brand identifier of the vehicle. Without it, the car could be mistaken for another manufacturer’s model, especially given the similar design language among hypercars. This logo is a key recognition feature, and its absence would compromise the identity of the subject. Therefore, it must be retained exactly as shown in the original image.",
      "question": "Is the McLaren logo clearly visible on the center of the car's hood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The shape of the headlights is uniquely designed for the McLaren P1 — narrow, curved, and integrated into the front fascia. This specific geometry is a core design element that distinguishes it from other models. Altering this shape would make the car unrecognizable as a P1. Thus, preserving this exact form is critical.",
      "question": "Are the headlights shaped in a narrow, curved, and horizontally elongated design with internal LED strips?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The orange brake calipers are a signature detail of McLaren’s performance lineup, often used for visual branding and contrast against silver or black components. Their presence adds authenticity and helps identify the car as a high-performance variant. Removing or changing their color would diminish the vehicle’s identity.",
      "question": "Are the brake calipers behind the front wheels colored bright orange?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The tree foliage must retain its rich green tone as per the instruction. While the foliage can be micro-scaled, its color must not shift toward yellow, brown, or artificial hues. Green is essential to maintain contrast with the urban environment and preserve naturalism within the miniature scene.",
      "question": "Do the tree leaves display a vibrant, natural green color without significant discoloration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The road markings (white dashed lines) provide spatial context and indicate traffic flow. Even in a miniature scene, these lines help establish scale and realism. Their absence or distortion would disrupt the coherence of the urban setting.",
      "question": "Are white lane markings present on the asphalt road beneath the car?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The dihedral door design is a defining feature of the McLaren P1, contributing to its futuristic aesthetic and functional identity. Although the doors may appear closed in the image, their characteristic upward-opening shape is implied by the car’s body structure. Preserving this structural outline ensures correct identification.",
      "question": "Does the car have a raised, sharply angled edge along the side above the wheel arches indicating dihedral door hinges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The presence of additional vehicles (red sedan and yellow sports car) in the background contributes to the realism and density of the city scene. Their inclusion supports the narrative of a populated urban area. Even if downsized, their presence should not be omitted unless explicitly stated.",
      "question": "Are there at least two other cars visible in the background — one red and one yellow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
