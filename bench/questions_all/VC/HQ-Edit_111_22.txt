Description of reference image: The subject is an elderly woman seated indoors, facing slightly to the left, with her head turned toward the viewer, revealing a gentle smile. Her silver hair is neatly styled in a high bun atop her head, with soft strands framing her face. She wears round, gold-rimmed spectacles that rest on her nose, and small circular earrings hang from her ears. Her attire consists of a layered traditional-style garment: a dark teal inner robe with a white collar, overlaid by a beige knitted cardigan featuring a vertical orange and blue patterned stripe along the shoulder seam. In her hands, she holds two wooden knitting needles and works on a multicolored knitted piece—rich in reds, purples, oranges, and blues—with visible stitches. A small round wooden table beside her holds several balls of yarn in vibrant colors: bright pink, green, light gray, and lavender. Behind her, a large window with white panes allows natural light to illuminate the room; ivy-like greenery drapes down from the top corners of the frame. To the right, a framed picture with a pink border hangs on the wall, depicting a faint sketch of a bird or animal. The background includes a wooden chair with carved backrest details and a potted plant with broad green leaves on a side table. The overall atmosphere is warm, serene, and domestic.

Thinking process:  
First, analyze the editing instructions word by word:  
- "Depict the woman in cartoon style" → This indicates a change in artistic rendering (e.g., line work, proportions, shading), but does not specify altering identity-defining features.  
- "Her knitting needles elongated" → Explicitly changes the **form** of the knitting needles, so their original length and proportion are no longer required.  
- "Yarn transformed into vibrant patterns" → Implies stylization of the yarn’s appearance, possibly replacing realistic texture with abstract designs; thus, original yarn texture and color distribution may be altered.  
- "Add delicate lace patterns to her robe" → New decorative element added to clothing; original fabric pattern may be modified or enhanced.  
- "Incorporate warm sepia tones" → Color palette transformation; original lighting and color balance can be changed.  
- "Frame each card with a wooden texture border" → Adds a new external frame not present in the original; this is a compositional addition.  
- "Include a blank section for personal messages" → Adds functional space for text; not part of original content.  

Allowed Changes List:  
- Artistic style (cartoon rendering)  
- Length and form of knitting needles  
- Texture and visual representation of yarn (including color and pattern)  
- Addition of lace patterns to robe  
- Color tone (sepia filter applied)  
- Frame border (wooden texture)  
- Blank message area (functional addition)  

Step 2 – Determine the elements that should remain unchanged  
Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements:  
- The subject's **facial features**, particularly her **smiling expression**, **round glasses**, **silver bun hairstyle**, and **earrings**, are key identifiers of her identity and character. These define her as an elderly, kind woman engaged in knitting—a central narrative point. Changing these would risk misidentification.  
- The **act of knitting** itself must remain logically consistent: her hands must still be positioned in a way that suggests knitting, even if tools are stylized.  
- The **presence of yarn balls** on the table is essential to the scene’s context—knitting requires materials. Their **position relative to her** and **existence** must be preserved, though individual colors or textures may be altered per instruction.  
- The **window with white panes** and **greenery hanging from above** establish the setting and lighting source. While color tone may shift due to sepia, the **structure of the window** and **placement of plants** must remain to preserve environmental logic.  
- The **traditional layered clothing** (inner robe with white collar, outer cardigan) defines cultural and stylistic context. Though lace may be added, the **basic structure and layering** must persist.  

Functional/logical association elements:  
- The **knitting action** depends on the **hands holding needles and yarn**. Even if needles are elongated, hands must maintain a grip position consistent with knitting.  
- The **table with yarn balls** must remain near her, supporting the activity. Its placement is functionally tied to the act of knitting.  
- The **chair** supports her posture; its presence and general shape must be retained for spatial coherence.  

Non-modified element deduction:  
After excluding allowed changes (style, needle length, yarn design, color tone, added lace, frame), the following must remain:  
- Facial features (eyes, mouth, glasses, hair bun)  
- Clothing layers and basic silhouette  
- Table with yarn balls  
- Window structure and plant placement  
- Chair shape and position  
- Overall composition of the figure seated at a table, engaged in knitting  

Preservation Targets List:  
- The woman’s facial expression (gentle smile, visible wrinkles)  
- Round gold-rimmed spectacles on her nose  
- Silver hair in a high bun  
- Small circular earrings  
- Traditional layered clothing: dark teal inner robe with white collar, beige cardigan  
- Hands actively knitting, holding needles and yarn  
- Presence of multiple yarn balls on the nearby table  
- Window with white panes and natural light  
- Hanging greenery from upper corners  
- Wooden chair with carved backrest  
- Position of the woman seated, facing slightly left, engaged in knitting  

Q1:  
Thinking process: The woman’s **round gold-rimmed spectacles** are a distinctive facial accessory that contributes to her identity and expression. They are clearly visible in the original image and are central to her appearance. If removed or altered significantly (e.g., replaced with modern frames), the character’s recognizability diminishes. This is a core identifying feature, hence a weight of 3 points.  
Question: Is the woman wearing round gold-rimmed spectacles on her nose?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The **silver hair styled in a high bun** is a defining trait of the elderly woman, distinguishing her age and demeanor. It is a prominent visual element in the original image. Removing or changing the hairstyle would alter her identity. This is a core recognition feature, thus weighted at 3 points.  
Question: Does the woman have silver hair styled in a high bun on top of her head?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The **act of knitting** is central to the scene. The hands must be shown holding needles and yarn in a manner consistent with knitting, even if the needles are elongated. The gesture and positioning of the hands are critical to maintaining the narrative logic of the image. Loss of this action undermines the purpose of the scene. This is a functional/logical element, so it is weighted at 3 points.  
Question: Are the woman’s hands positioned in a way that shows her actively knitting with needles and yarn?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The **presence of multiple yarn balls** on the small wooden table is essential to the knitting context. Their existence supports the activity depicted. While colors or textures may be changed per instruction, their **presence and location** must be retained. This is a key scene element, so it receives a weight of 2 points.  
Question: Are there multiple balls of yarn placed on the small wooden table next to the woman?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The **window with white panes** provides the primary light source and establishes the indoor setting. Its structure and position are crucial to the scene’s realism and spatial layout. Even with sepia tones, the window’s grid pattern and placement must remain to preserve environmental consistency. This is an important background element, so it is weighted at 2 points.  
Question: Is there a window with white panes behind the woman, allowing natural light into the room?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The **dark teal inner robe with a white collar** is a key component of her traditional attire. The contrast between the dark fabric and white lining is visually distinct and contributes to her cultural appearance. Altering this could change the perceived style or identity. This is a significant clothing detail, so it is weighted at 2 points.  
Question: Does the woman wear a dark teal inner robe with a visible white collar?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The **hanging greenery from the top corners** adds depth and natural ambiance to the room. While the specific plant type may vary, the **presence and position** of foliage in the upper corners are part of the original composition. This detail enhances visual balance and authenticity. It is a minor but meaningful environmental feature, so it is weighted at 1 point.  
Question: Are there green leafy plants hanging from the top corners of the frame?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q8:  
Thinking process: The **small wooden chair with a carved backrest** supports the woman’s seated posture. Its shape and position are necessary for spatial coherence. Although the style may be softened in cartoon form, the **basic structure** must remain recognizable. This is a secondary structural element, so it is weighted at 1 point.  
Question: Is the woman seated on a wooden chair with a carved backrest?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1
