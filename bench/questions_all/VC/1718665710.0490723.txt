**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a young male character with curly dark brown hair, styled in soft waves falling over the forehead. His facial features include sharp cheekbones, a straight nose, and striking blue eyes. He wears ornate medieval-style armor composed of silver and gold elements with intricate engravings, including a high collar and broad shoulder pauldrons featuring detailed filigree patterns. The armor has a metallic sheen with visible highlights and reflections. Over the armor, he wears a deep red velvet cloak that drapes over his shoulders. The background consists of a grand cathedral-like interior with tall arched stone columns, ribbed vaulting, and large stained-glass windows allowing diffused natural light to filter through. The architecture exhibits Gothic design elements such as pointed arches and vertical emphasis.

Thinking process:  
The editing instruction explicitly states: *"Transform the character into a stylized keychain with a chibi medieval knight appearance."* This means the **form** of the subject will be changed from a full-sized portrait to a small, cartoonish figurine. The instruction further specifies changes in style: *"Highlight the ornate armor with glossy enamel colors and thick black outlines,"* indicating that the **artistic rendering** (coloration, line work) will shift from photorealistic to stylized. It also mentions *"the head should be oversized while retaining curly hair details,"* so **proportion** (head-to-body ratio) will change, but **curly hair texture** must remain identifiable. The instruction adds *"Attach it to a small silver chain, set against a simple dark velvet background"* — this implies the **scene/background** will be replaced entirely.

Allowed Changes List:  
- The overall form of the subject (from realistic human portrait to chibi keychain figure)  
- Proportions (oversized head, smaller body)  
- Art style (from photorealistic to stylized with thick black outlines and glossy enamel colors)  
- Background (from Gothic cathedral to dark velvet surface)  
- Scale (reduced to keychain size)  
- Material rendering (metallic textures replaced with enamel-like glossiness)  
- Color treatment (armor may gain more saturated or non-realistic hues)  
- Addition of a silver chain attached to the figure

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements are those that define the identity of the subject and cannot be altered without losing its essential identity. In this case, the original image presents a specific character defined by unique visual traits:  
- The **curly dark brown hair**, particularly its **texture and volume**, is a defining feature of the character’s appearance. Even though the instruction allows for an oversized head, it specifically says "retaining curly hair details" — this makes the **curl pattern and hair structure** a core retention requirement.  
- The **ornate armor design**, especially the **specific shape and engraving patterns** on the pauldrons and chest plate, constitutes a key identifier. While color and finish may change (to enamel), the **iconic forms and motifs** must persist to maintain visual continuity.  
- The **red cloak** is a significant accessory; its **color and drape** contribute to the character’s regal aesthetic and must be preserved in essence, even if stylized.  
- The **facial structure**, particularly the **blue eyes**, **nose shape**, and **jawline**, serve as identity anchors. Though stylized, the underlying facial proportions should reflect the original to retain likeness.  

Functional/logical association elements:  
- The **connection between the character and the armor** is functional — they are worn together. Even in chibi form, the armor must remain attached and properly positioned.  
- The **attachment point of the chain** is implied to be part of the keychain, but since it's a new element, no original logic is disrupted.  

Non-modified element deduction:  
After excluding allowed changes (style, scale, background, proportion), the remaining **unmentioned but visually distinct** features must be retained:  
- The **shape of the pauldrons**, especially their angular, wing-like extension and engraved patterns  
- The **central clasp or medallion** on the chest armor  
- The **high collar** with decorative trim  
- The **texture and flow of the red cloak**  
- The **hair’s curl direction and density**  

These elements, while not explicitly mentioned as “must keep,” are essential for visual coherence and identity preservation under transformation.

Preservation Targets List:  
- The **curly dark brown hair** with its distinct wave pattern and volume  
- The **ornate armor’s structural design**, including shoulder pauldrons and chest plate motifs  
- The **deep red cloak** draped over the shoulders  
- The **blue eyes** of the character  
- The **overall facial structure** (nose, jaw, cheekbones)  
- The **engraved patterns on the armor** (filigree, symmetrical designs)  
- The **presence of the high collar** with decorative edge

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

Q1:  
Thinking process: The **curly dark brown hair** is a core identity feature of the character. Its distinctive wave pattern and volume are critical for recognition. The instruction explicitly requires retaining "curly hair details," meaning the **texture and curl structure** must remain intact even when scaled up in a chibi form. If these details are lost or simplified beyond recognition, the character becomes unidentifiable. This is a **core recognition element**, thus assigned **3 points**.  
Question: Does the edited image retain the curly, voluminous dark brown hair with visible wave patterns?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3

Q2:  
Thinking process: The **ornate armor design**, particularly the **shoulder pauldrons**, contains unique engraved patterns that define the character’s noble and martial identity. These are not generic but have specific shapes and symmetry. Even if rendered in enamel style, the **basic form and motif layout** must be preserved to maintain continuity. Losing them would result in a different character. This is a **core identity feature**, hence **3 points**.  
Question: Are the broad shoulder pauldrons with their intricate engraved patterns still present and recognizable in the keychain version?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3

Q3:  
Thinking process: The **deep red cloak** is a major visual component, contributing to the character’s regal and dramatic presence. While color might be adjusted slightly for enamel effect, the **presence and drape** of the red fabric over the shoulders must be maintained. Removing or changing it fundamentally alters the character’s appearance. This is an **important accessory**, affecting identity and scene consistency, thus **2 points**.  
Question: Is the deep red cloak still draped over the shoulders and visible in the keychain design?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2

Q4:  
Thinking process: The **blue eyes** are a defining facial feature, contrasting with the dark hair and armor. They are central to the character’s expression and identity. Even in stylized form, the **color and placement** of the eyes must remain consistent. Altering eye color or removing them would compromise recognition. This is a **key facial identifier**, therefore **3 points**.  
Question: Are the character’s blue eyes clearly visible and retained in the same position on the face?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3

Q5:  
Thinking process: The **high collar with decorative trim** is part of the armor’s upper structure and contributes to the character’s formal, noble look. It is a **distinctive silhouette element** that separates this character from others. Even in chibi form, its **shape and position** must be preserved. Its loss would make the armor appear incomplete. This is a **structural detail** vital for consistency, thus **2 points**.  
Question: Is the high collar with its decorative edge still present around the neck area?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2

Q6:  
Thinking process: The **engraved patterns on the chest armor**, especially the central medallion and symmetrical lines, are unique design elements that reflect craftsmanship and status. These are **iconic motifs** that help identify the armor as belonging to this specific character. Their absence would suggest a different character or rank. This is a **core design feature**, hence **3 points**.  
Question: Are the engraved patterns on the chest armor, including the central medallion and symmetrical lines, still visible and preserved?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3

Q7:  
Thinking process: The **facial structure**, including the **jawline, nose shape, and cheekbones**, defines the character’s likeness. While stylized, the **underlying proportions** must match the original to maintain identity. A completely reshaped face would break continuity. This is a **core facial identity element**, thus **3 points**.  
Question: Does the character’s face retain the original jawline, nose shape, and cheekbone structure despite stylization?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3
