Description of reference image: The subject consists of four zebras grazing in a grassy field. Each zebra displays the characteristic black-and-white striped coat, with stripes varying in thickness and pattern across the body—thicker on the back and flanks, thinner on the legs and face. The zebras are positioned at different angles, all with heads lowered in a natural grazing posture, indicating active feeding behavior. Their manes are short, upright, and striped in alternating black and white bands. The ears are pointed and alert, with visible inner ear structure. The hooves are dark and firmly planted on the ground. The background features a lush green field with scattered small shrubs and patches of bare soil. A wire fence with wooden posts runs horizontally across the mid-ground, separating the field from a dense line of green trees and bushes in the distance. The sky is clear and light blue, suggesting daytime under bright sunlight. Shadows cast by the zebras are sharp and consistent with overhead lighting.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions word by word. The instruction states to "recreate the zebras as charming chibi-style 3D figures featuring oversized, adorable traits," which means the form, proportions, and style of the zebras can be altered—specifically their size, facial features, and overall design—to become stylized and cartoonish. However, it explicitly requires retaining "their signature striped coats" and "realistic grazing stances." This indicates that while the artistic style changes, the core visual identity of the zebras (stripes) and their functional posture (grazing) must remain intact. Additionally, the instruction specifies to "keep the surroundings photorealistic, preserving the lush green field and fencing," meaning the environment—including the grass, shrubs, fence, trees, and sky—must not be stylized or altered in content or realism. Finally, the instruction adds an "ornate decorative photo frame" around the entire scene, which is a new element not present in the original and thus does not affect retention of original content.

Allowed Changes List:
- Zebra form and proportions (e.g., head size, body shape) — allowed to change due to chibi-style transformation
- Facial features (e.g., eyes, nose, mouth) — allowed to be exaggerated for cuteness
- Artistic rendering style of zebras — allowed to shift to 3D chibi aesthetic
- Addition of ornate decorative photo frame — allowed as a new framing element

Step 2- Determine the elements that should remain unchanged  
Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements: Zebras are identified primarily by their unique black-and-white stripe patterns. These stripes are not uniform but vary in width, direction, and continuity across the body—especially on the neck, torso, legs, and face. The presence and specific arrangement of these stripes are essential for species identification. Even if the zebras are stylized, the instruction mandates retention of "signature striped coats," so the stripe pattern must remain visually recognizable and faithful to the original. The grazing stance is also specified to be retained, meaning the posture—head down, legs bent, body angled forward—must be preserved despite stylistic changes.  

Functional/logical association elements: The grazing action implies interaction with the environment (eating grass), so the orientation of the head toward the ground and the positioning of the legs must maintain logical consistency with this behavior. If the posture were drastically altered (e.g., standing upright), it would contradict the intended activity.  

Non-modified element deduction: After excluding allowed changes (form, facial features, style), the remaining unmentioned details—such as the exact location of the stripes on the legs, the texture of the grass, the structure of the fence, and the tree line—must be retained based on the instruction to preserve the surroundings photorealistically. These elements contribute to environmental authenticity and spatial coherence. The fence’s wooden posts and wire strands, the distribution of shrubs, and the color and texture of the grass are all part of the original scene and must remain unchanged unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Preservation Targets List:  
- The black-and-white striped pattern on the zebras’ bodies, including variation in stripe thickness and alignment  
- The grazing posture of each zebra (head lowered, legs positioned for feeding)  
- The lush green grass field with scattered small shrubs and patches of bare soil  
- The wire fence with evenly spaced wooden posts running horizontally across the mid-ground  
- The dense line of green trees and bushes in the background  
- The clear light blue sky above the horizon  

Q1:  
Thinking process: The black-and-white striped pattern is the defining biological and visual feature of zebras. It is the primary identifier distinguishing them from other animals. The instruction explicitly requires retention of "signature striped coats," meaning the presence, color contrast, and general layout of the stripes must remain. Loss of this pattern would render the subjects unrecognizable as zebras, regardless of any chibi styling. Therefore, this is a core identity element with a weight of 3 points.  
Question: Are the zebras' bodies covered in distinct black and white stripes that follow the natural pattern seen in the original image, including variations in thickness and alignment across the torso, legs, and face?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The grazing stance is a key behavioral and postural element that defines the scene's context. The instruction specifies retaining "realistic grazing stances," which means the head must be lowered toward the ground, and the legs must support this position. Altering this posture would contradict the described behavior and disrupt the scene’s logic. This is a critical functional element tied to the animal’s interaction with the environment, making it a high-priority retention target.  
Question: Is each zebra depicted with its head lowered toward the ground in a natural grazing pose, with legs positioned to support this stance?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The wire fence with wooden posts is a structural element that defines the boundary of the enclosure and contributes to the realism of the setting. The instruction explicitly requires preserving the fencing, so its presence, material (wire and wood), and linear arrangement must remain unchanged. Removing or altering it would violate the directive to keep the surroundings photorealistic. This is an important scene element affecting environmental authenticity.  
Question: Is the horizontal wire fence with evenly spaced wooden posts clearly visible across the mid-ground of the image, separating the field from the treeline?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The lush green grass field with scattered shrubs and patches of bare soil forms the primary ground surface and provides ecological context. The instruction mandates preserving the "lush green field," so the color, texture, and distribution of grass and vegetation must remain consistent with the original. Any significant alteration (e.g., changing to artificial turf or removing shrubs) would compromise the photorealism requirement. This is a major environmental detail supporting scene coherence.  
Question: Is the ground covered in green grass with visible patches of bare soil and small green shrubs scattered throughout the field?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The background treeline and sky provide depth and atmospheric context. The instruction specifies preserving the "lush green field and fencing," which includes the surrounding vegetation and sky. The dense line of green trees and bushes behind the fence, along with the clear light blue sky, are integral to the scene’s composition and realism. Altering these would disrupt the environmental continuity. While not the most critical, they are essential for maintaining the original setting.  
Question: Is there a continuous line of green trees and bushes behind the fence, with a clear light blue sky above the horizon?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The texture and color of the zebra’s mane are part of their natural appearance and contribute to species-specific identification. Although the instruction allows chibi-style exaggeration, it does not permit removal or fundamental alteration of the mane’s striped pattern. The mane must retain its black-and-white striped nature and upright orientation, even if stylized. This is a secondary but identifiable detail that supports accurate representation.  
Question: Do the zebras have short, upright manes composed of alternating black and white stripes, consistent with their body patterns?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The hooves are functional parts of the zebra’s anatomy and are visible in the original image. They are dark in color and firmly placed on the ground, contributing to the realistic depiction of the animal’s stance. While the instruction allows stylistic changes, it does not mention altering the hooves, and since the grazing stance must be preserved, the placement and appearance of the hooves must remain consistent with the original. This is a minor but coherent detail.  
Question: Are the zebra’s hooves dark in color and positioned on the ground in a way that supports their grazing posture?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1
