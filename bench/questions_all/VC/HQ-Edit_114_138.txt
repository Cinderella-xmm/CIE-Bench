Description of reference image: The subject is an elderly woman with silver hair styled in a neat bun, wearing round wire-rimmed glasses and small pearl earrings. She is dressed in a traditional Chinese silk robe (qipao) with a light beige base color, adorned with delicate floral embroidery in pink and green tones, featuring black frog closures along the front. Her hands are positioned on an open book with dark brown leather binding, gold embossed patterns, and aged pages. To her right sits a blue-and-white porcelain teacup filled with yellow tea, resting on a matching saucer. The background consists of tall wooden bookshelves densely packed with uniformly bound books in various shades of brown, green, and gold, suggesting a scholarly or classical library setting. The table surface beneath her has a richly patterned golden-brown fabric with intricate designs. The lighting is soft and warm, enhancing the textures of the silk, leather, and wood.

Thinking process:  
First, analyze the editing instructions word by word:  
- "Create a decorative print series with the woman in semi-cartoon style": This indicates a stylistic transformation to semi-cartoon form, allowing changes in rendering style, line work, and proportions.  
- "Emphasize her silk robe with gold highlights and floral patterns": The robe’s presence and floral motif must remain, but enhancements like gold highlights are permitted.  
- "Turn her book into a layered story scene": The book’s physical existence is preserved, but its internal content and structure may be transformed into a narrative illustration.  
- "Add ornate bookshelf designs": The bookshelf background can be stylized or enhanced with ornamental details.  
- "Include detachable bookmark panels with vintage tea motifs for functional appeal": These are new additions, not present in the original, so their inclusion does not affect retention requirements.  

From this, we infer:  
- **Allowed changes**: Rendering style (semi-cartoon), visual enhancement of robe (gold highlights), transformation of book content into layered scenes, ornamental redesign of bookshelves, addition of bookmarks.  
- **Not allowed to change**: Core identity features of the woman (e.g., hairstyle, facial structure, glasses, earrings), the presence and basic form of the book, the teacup and saucer, the qipao's fundamental design (including floral pattern and frog closures), the table surface texture, and the overall composition (woman seated at table in front of bookshelves).  

Allowed Changes List:  
(Silk robe’s color tone and sheen can be enhanced with gold highlights)  
(Book’s interior pages can be transformed into layered story scenes)  
(Bookshelf design can be made more ornate)  
(Styling of the woman can shift to semi-cartoon aesthetic)  
(New elements such as detachable bookmarks can be added)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements:  
- The woman’s distinct appearance—silver bun hairstyle, round wire-rimmed glasses, and pearl earrings—are key identifiers. Changing these would fundamentally alter her identity.  
- The qipao’s floral pattern and black frog closures are culturally specific and visually distinctive; they define the garment’s identity.  
- The book’s physical form (open, leather-bound, aged pages) and position in her hands are essential for logical coherence—she must still appear to be reading.  
- The teacup and saucer are functional props tied to the scene’s logic (tea drinking during reading); removing them disrupts the narrative.  
- The bookshelf backdrop establishes the setting; while it can be ornately redesigned, its role as a dense collection of books must remain.  

Functional/logical association elements:  
- The woman holds the book with both hands, which maintains the action of reading. This hand-object interaction must persist even if the book is transformed.  
- The teacup is placed to her right on the table, indicating a stable spatial relationship that supports realism.  
- The tablecloth’s patterned texture anchors the foreground and provides visual continuity.  

Non-modified element deduction:  
After excluding allowed modifications (style, gold highlights, book content, shelf ornamentation), the remaining elements—such as the woman’s facial structure, earring type, glass shape, robe’s base pattern, cup/saucer design, and book’s external form—must be retained. These are not mentioned as changeable and are critical to preserving the original image’s core identity and logic.

Preservation Targets List:  
(The woman’s silver hair styled in a bun)  
(The round wire-rimmed glasses on her face)  
(The small pearl earrings in her ears)  
(The light beige qipao with floral embroidery and black frog closures)  
(The open book with dark brown leather cover and visible aged pages)  
(The blue-and-white porcelain teacup with yellow liquid inside)  
(The saucer beneath the teacup)  
(The patterned golden-brown tablecloth)  
(The woman’s seated posture at the table, facing forward)  
(The background of densely packed books on wooden shelves)

Q1:  
Thinking process: The silver bun hairstyle is a defining feature of the woman’s identity in the original image. Its absence or replacement with another hairstyle would make her unrecognizable. It is a core identity element, especially when combined with her age and attire. Therefore, it must be retained exactly as shown—positioned atop her head, neatly arranged, and clearly silver in color. This is a 3-point question because losing this feature would compromise recognition of the subject.

Q2:  
Thinking process: The round wire-rimmed glasses are a signature accessory that contributes to her intellectual and dignified appearance. They are clearly defined in the original image and serve as a key facial identifier. Altering their shape or removing them would significantly affect her identity. This is a 3-point question because glasses are a primary facial feature and central to her recognizable look.

Q4:  
Thinking process: The qipao’s floral pattern and black frog closures are iconic design elements of traditional Chinese dress. The floral motifs are specifically rendered in pink and green on a beige background, and the black frogs are visible along the front closure. These features distinguish the garment from others and must be preserved. Changing them would misrepresent the cultural context. This is a 3-point question because the clothing’s design is central to the subject’s identity and setting.

Q5:  
Thinking process: The open book with a dark brown leather cover and visible aged pages is central to the scene’s narrative. Even though its interior may be transformed into a layered story scene, the external form—its size, shape, color, and how it is held—must remain intact. This ensures continuity in the action of reading. This is a 3-point question because the book is a functional object in the scene and a core element of the composition.

Question: Is the teacup resting on a matching blue-and-white saucer?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1

Q8:  
Thinking process: The patterned golden-brown tablecloth provides a textured foreground and grounds the scene. Its intricate design is visible and contributes to the richness of the environment. While not a core identity element, it enhances visual consistency and must be retained. This is a 1-point question because it is a background detail affecting overall aesthetic coherence.  
Question: Is the table covered with a patterned golden-brown fabric?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1

Q9:  
Thinking process: The woman’s seated posture at the table, facing forward, is essential to the composition. It defines her relationship to the book and the surrounding environment. Changing her pose would disrupt the scene’s balance and narrative. This is a 2-point question because it affects the overall spatial logic and viewer engagement.
