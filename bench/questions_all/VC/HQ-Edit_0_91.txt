**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is an elderly East Asian man with neatly combed white hair, wearing a traditional Korean hanbok. The garment features a dark base fabric adorned with intricate floral patterns in vibrant colors such as red, blue, yellow, and gold. The outer robe has wide sleeves with detailed embroidery along the edges, and the collar and lapel are trimmed in deep blue and maroon. A white inner layer is visible at the neckline. The central chest area displays a prominent floral motif with a circular golden medallion-like element at its center. The hands are clasped gently in front of the body, showing aged skin texture with visible veins and wrinkles. The background is a neutral beige tone with subtle textured brushstrokes and faint reddish-brown smudges, resembling aged parchment or canvas.

Thinking process:  
The editing instructions specify several modifications:
- Transform the figure into a **semi-cartoon style**, which implies stylization of facial features, proportions, and line work.
- **Highlight textile patterns with gold leaf accents**, indicating that the existing floral designs should be emphasized using metallic gold elements.
- **Slightly enlarge the hands** for emphasis — this directly alters scale but not identity.
- **Frame each print with deep indigo borders**, meaning the surrounding frame will be added post-editing.
- **Integrate subtle, hand-drawn floral outlines extending from the robe into the frame**, suggesting new decorative elements drawn beyond the original image boundaries.

From this, we can deduce:
- The **style** of the figure (realistic portrait) will change to semi-cartoon → allowed modification.
- The **texture and pattern details** on clothing may be enhanced with gold leaf → allowed enhancement, but original patterns must remain recognizable.
- The **hands** will be enlarged → allowed proportion change.
- The **background** will be replaced or extended with framing and floral extensions → allowed modification.
- **New artistic elements** (hand-drawn florals, indigo frame) will be introduced → allowed additions.

Therefore, any element **not explicitly mentioned for alteration** or **not implied by the transformation** must be preserved.

Allowed Changes List:  
- Style of rendering (realistic → semi-cartoon)  
- Size of hands (slightly enlarged)  
- Addition of gold leaf accents on textile patterns  
- Frame addition (deep indigo border)  
- Extension of floral motifs beyond robe into frame via hand-drawn lines  
- Background modification (to include frame and extended florals)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements:  
- The **subject’s identity** as an elderly man in traditional Korean attire is defined by specific visual markers:  
  - Facial structure: high cheekbones, deep-set eyes, pronounced nasolabial folds, and white hair arranged in a formal side-parted style.  
  - Clothing type: hanbok with characteristic V-neck collar, layered lapels (blue and maroon), and wide sleeves.  
  - Specific design elements: the **central floral panel with golden medallion**, the **floral embroidery on sleeves and shoulders**, and the **color scheme** (dark base with colorful floral patterns).  
  These are essential to identifying the subject as a dignified elder in traditional dress; altering them fundamentally would misrepresent the cultural and personal identity.

Functional/logical association elements:  
- The **position of hands clasped in front** suggests formality and stillness — this posture supports the dignity of the subject. While size may increase, the **clasp gesture and placement** must remain intact to preserve logical coherence.  
- The **relationship between the robe’s pattern and the body** (e.g., how floral motifs align with the torso and sleeves) must be maintained to avoid dissonance.

Non-modified element deduction:  
After excluding allowed changes:
- The **exact shape and location of the golden medallion** in the center of the floral panel must remain unchanged — it is a unique focal point.
- The **color palette** of the robe (especially the contrast between dark base and bright flowers) should be preserved unless modified only by gold accentuation.
- The **hairline and direction of parting** (side-parted, swept back) must remain consistent — it is a key identifier of age and grooming.
- The **facial expression** (calm, slight smile, closed lips) contributes to the dignified aura and should not be distorted beyond cartoon stylization.

Preservation Targets List:  
- The presence and position of the central golden medallion within the floral panel on the chest  
- The color and composition of the floral embroidery on the sleeves and shoulder areas  
- The side-parted white hair styled neatly back from the forehead  
- The clasp of hands in front of the body, maintaining their relative positioning  
- The V-shaped collar with blue and maroon trim and white inner lining  
- The overall silhouette and structure of the hanbok (including sleeve width and length)

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

Q1:  
Thinking process: The golden medallion at the center of the chest panel is a unique ornamental feature that anchors the floral design. Its presence and position are critical to the visual balance and cultural symbolism of the robe. If removed or relocated, the robe loses its distinctiveness and becomes unrecognizable as the original garment. This is a core identity element tied to the subject's attire, making it a 3-point weight question.  
Question: Is the circular golden medallion located at the center of the floral panel on the chest still present and positioned in the same place?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3

Q2:  
Thinking process: The floral embroidery on the sleeves and shoulders features a complex arrangement of multicolored flowers (red, blue, yellow, white) with detailed petals and stems. This pattern is integral to the robe’s identity and distinguishes it from other garments. Even if gold leaf is added, the underlying pattern must remain identifiable. Altering or omitting these motifs would compromise the authenticity of the textile. Thus, this is a 3-point weight element.  
Question: Are the multicolored floral patterns (including red, blue, yellow, and white flowers) visible on the sleeves and shoulders of the robe, maintaining their original positions and compositions?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3

Q3:  
Thinking process: The side-parted white hair is a defining trait of the subject’s appearance. It reflects age, dignity, and cultural grooming norms. In a semi-cartoon style, the hair might be simplified, but its side-parted direction and fullness must be preserved to maintain recognition. Losing this feature would alter the subject’s identity. Therefore, it is a 3-point weight element.  
Question: Is the white hair parted on the left side and swept back neatly from the forehead, forming a clear division down the middle of the head?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3

Q4:  
Thinking process: The hands are clasped in front of the body, with fingers interlocked. This gesture conveys calmness and formality. Although the instruction allows enlargement, the **relative positioning and interlocking of fingers** must remain consistent. Changing this would disrupt the logical posture. This is an important functional element affecting scene coherence, so it receives a 2-point weight.  
Question: Are the hands positioned in front of the body with fingers interlocked and palms touching, maintaining the original clasp orientation?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2

Q5:  
Thinking process: The V-shaped collar with layered blue and maroon trim over a white inner lining is a signature feature of the hanbok. It defines the garment’s structure and cultural identity. Any deviation in trim color or shape would make the robe unrecognizable. Since the instruction does not mention changing the collar design, it must be preserved. This is a key accessory detail, so it gets a 2-point weight.  
Question: Does the collar retain the V-shape with blue outer trim, maroon inner binding, and a visible white inner lining at the neck?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2

Q6:  
Thinking process: The sleeve width and length are characteristic of traditional hanbok. While the style may become cartoonish, the **proportional width and fullness of the sleeves** must remain consistent to preserve the garment’s silhouette. Narrowing or shortening them would distort the cultural representation. This is a secondary but important structural detail, hence a 1-point weight.  
Question: Do the sleeves maintain their original wide, flowing shape extending to the wrists without significant narrowing or shortening?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1

Q7:  
Thinking process: The background is a neutral beige with faint textural marks, resembling aged paper. While the instruction allows framing and floral extensions, the **original background texture and color** beneath the figure must remain visible where not overlaid. This provides context and aesthetic continuity. It is a minor environmental detail but contributes to visual coherence. Thus, it is a 1-point weight.  
Question: Is the original beige textured background with subtle reddish-brown smudges still visible behind the figure, especially around the upper shoulders and sides?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1
