      "thinking_process": "The light blue spiky hair is the most distinctive feature of Vegeta’s Super Saiyan Blue transformation. It is a core identity marker that distinguishes him from other forms (like Super Saiyan God or base form). Without this specific hair color and style, the character would not be recognizable as Super Saiyan Blue Vegeta. Therefore, its presence and color must be preserved.",

      "thinking_process": "The white gloves and boots with yellow tips are part of Vegeta’s standard attire and contribute to his visual consistency across media. These details are minor but help maintain authenticity. Their absence would reduce visual fidelity.",
      "question": "Are the gloves and boots white with yellow tips at the fingers and toes?",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The fierce facial expression with an open mouth and intense eyes is characteristic of Vegeta during battle. This expression conveys aggression and power, essential to his persona. Losing it would make the character appear passive or unrecognizable.",
      "question": "Does the character have an open mouth and intense eyes showing aggression?",

      "thinking_process": "The muscular build and dynamic mid-air pose are central to the action being depicted. The pose suggests a powerful jump, which aligns with the tutorial’s theme. Preserving the anatomical structure and movement ensures the tutorial remains grounded in the original action.",
      "question": "Is the character shown in a dynamic mid-air pose with arms raised and legs bent backward?",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The character’s identity as Vegeta is fundamental. Even if stylized, the face shape, hairstyle, and outfit must clearly indicate he is Vegeta. Misidentifying the character undermines the entire purpose of the tutorial.",
      "question": "Is the character clearly identifiable as Vegeta from Dragon Ball?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
