### Step 1 - Description of Reference Image and Allowed Changes List:

**Description of Reference Image:**  
The image depicts a rainy street scene with five individuals. A woman in a beige coat and orange dress holds an umbrella while walking beside a child in a blue raincoat who is joyfully splashing in puddles. Another woman in a brown dress dances with a man in a suit under an umbrella. In the background, an older man with a cane and hat stands under his own umbrella. The background consists of blurred trees and a wet pavement reflecting the rain.

**Thinking Process:**  
The editing instructions specify transforming the scene into a sunny park while adjusting the characters' clothing to match the new weather. This means the weather conditions, lighting, and background can be altered. However, the characters' positions, postures, and interactions should remain consistent.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
1. Weather condition (rainy to sunny)  
2. Lighting (dull to bright)  
3. Background (street to park)  
4. Characters' clothing (rain-appropriate to sunny weather-appropriate)  

### Step 2 - Determination of Elements That Should Remain Unchanged:

**Thinking Process:**  
Core recognition elements include the characters' identities, their interactions, and their positions relative to each other. Functional/logical elements include the umbrellas (if present, they should logically fit the new weather context) and the child's playful action. Remaining elements like the characters' facial expressions and body language contribute to visual coherence.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
1. Characters' identities and postures  
2. Interactions between characters (e.g., dancing couple, child splashing)  
3. Facial expressions and body language  
4. Relative positions of characters
