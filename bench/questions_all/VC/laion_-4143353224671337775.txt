Description of reference image: The subject is a ceramic figurine shaped like a stylized human head with exaggerated facial features. It has a wide, open-mouthed grin showing white teeth, prominent black eyebrows, and large round ears that are dark in color. The top of the head is glazed in a greenish-blue hue, resembling hair or a headdress, while the rest of the surface is off-white with beige and brown discolorations typical of aged ceramics. There is a small circular hole on the side near the ear, likely for ventilation or functional use. The base of the object appears slightly worn, with minor green glaze spots and uneven texture along the rim. The overall form is rounded and bulbous, suggesting it may be a container or decorative vessel. The background is neutral gray, providing no distraction from the object.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions to determine what can be changed. The instruction explicitly states to "transform the ceramic form into an elaborate puzzle piece sculpture," indicating the physical structure and material composition of the object are to be altered. It specifies replacing the conical top with a smooth green-colored puzzle fragment, which implies the original shape and glaze pattern on the top can be modified. The instruction also says to position the artwork horizontally on a plain white shelf, meaning the orientation and display environment are to be changed. Therefore, allowed changes include:
- The overall form (ceramic → puzzle piece sculpture)
- The material appearance (smooth puzzle pieces instead of glazed ceramic)
- The top shape (conical → smooth green puzzle fragment)
- Orientation (vertical → horizontal)
- Display setting (neutral background → white shelf)

Allowed Changes List:
(Specific element 1 that allows for changes: Overall three-dimensional form of the object)
(Specific element 2 that allows for changes: Material texture and surface finish)
(Specific element 3 that allows for changes: Top portion shape and coloration)
(Specific element 4 that allows for changes: Object orientation)
(Specific element 5 that allows for changes: Background and display surface)

Thinking process:
Explain the criteria for determining the core recognition elements: The original object is a ceramic face sculpture with distinctive facial features such as the wide grin, black eyebrows, and dark ears. These features are not just stylistic but serve as key identifiers of the object's identity as a stylized anthropomorphic head. Even if transformed into a puzzle piece form, the facial expression must remain recognizable to preserve its character. The presence of the mouth with visible teeth, the eye sockets, and the eyebrow shapes are essential to maintaining the identity of the figure.

Explain the reasons why functional/logical elements need to be retained: Although the form is being changed, the function of the object as a sculptural representation of a face remains relevant. The logical association between the facial features and the identity of the sculpture must be preserved. For example, the placement of the eyes and mouth must still align spatially to maintain facial coherence, even if made of interlocking puzzle pieces.

Explain the logic of retaining the remaining elements based on visual coherence and common sense after excluding allowed changes: After removing the allowable changes (form, material, orientation), the facial features—especially the expressive mouth, eyebrows, ears, and eye holes—are the only parts that define the object’s identity. These must be preserved in their relative positions and forms to ensure the sculpture remains identifiable as the same character. Additionally, the green glaze on the top, though replaced by a green puzzle fragment, retains the same color and function as a distinguishing feature.

Preservation Targets List:
(Facial expression with wide open mouth and visible teeth)
(Black eyebrows positioned above eye sockets)
(Dark ears on either side of the head)
(Eye sockets with circular openings)
(Green-colored area on top of the head)

    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The wide open mouth with clearly defined white teeth is a core identifying feature of the ceramic face. This exaggerated grin is central to the object's character and expression. If this feature is lost or altered significantly, the sculpture would no longer be recognizable as the original figure. Therefore, the presence and structure of the mouth and teeth are critical identity markers.
    Question: Does the edited image retain the wide open mouth with visible white teeth?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The black eyebrows are prominent and uniquely positioned above the eye sockets, contributing to the expressive nature of the face. Their shape and placement are essential for facial recognition. Removing or altering them would change the emotional tone and identity of the figure.
    Question: Are the black eyebrows present and positioned above the eye sockets?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The dark, rounded ears are distinctive and symmetrically placed on either side of the head. They are part of the face’s iconic silhouette. Losing these would disrupt the balance and recognizability of the sculpture.
    Question: Are the dark, rounded ears present on both sides of the head?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The eye sockets are hollow and circular, serving as key structural features of the face. Their presence and placement are necessary for maintaining the facial symmetry and identity of the sculpture. Even if the surrounding material changes, these openings must remain.
    Question: Are there two circular eye sockets visible on the face?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The green-colored area on the top of the head is a unique visual marker, distinguishing it from other parts of the sculpture. While the instruction allows replacing it with a green puzzle fragment, the color and location must be preserved to maintain continuity with the original design.
    Question: Is there a green-colored section on the top of the head?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
