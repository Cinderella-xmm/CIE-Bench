Description of reference image: The subject is a white toilet situated in a corner against walls tiled with large gray square tiles. The toilet lid is open, revealing the inside of the bowl. The flush tank is attached to the wall behind the toilet. The floor also has matching gray square tiles. There are no other significant objects visible in the frame.

### Step 1 - Allowed Changes List:
- Specific element 1 that allows for changes: Adding text "Clean First" in the top left and "Comfort Always" in the bottom right.
- Specific element 2 that allows for changes: Design adjustments to match the style of a public health promotion poster.

### Step 2 - Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged:
#### Thinking Process:
- **Core Recognition Elements:** The white toilet, its open lid, and the flush tank are the core elements of this image. These features define it as a toilet scene and should be retained.
- **Functional/Logical Association Elements:** The position of the toilet in the corner with the flush tank attached to the wall logically supports its function and should be maintained for visual coherence.
- **Retaining Remaining Elements:** The gray tile background and floor contribute to the setting's simplicity. These aspects should be kept to avoid disrupting the sceneâ€™s context and visual consistency.

#### Preservation Targets List:
- The white color and structure of the toilet.
- The open toilet lid and visibility of the bowl interior.
- The flush tank placement and its connection to the wall.
- The gray tiled walls and floor design.
