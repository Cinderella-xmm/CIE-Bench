**Step 2 - Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

Thinking process: Use the exclusion method to identify critical features:

- Core Identity: Clothing, hairstyles, and tennis rackets must be recognizable.

- Remaining Visual Coherence: Positioning relative to the net, presence of tennis balls.

Preservation Targets List:
- Playersâ€™ clothing and hairstyles (iconic features).
- Players holding tennis rackets (functional element).
- Players engaged in a handshake over the net (logical scene feature).
- Presence of tennis balls and net (secondary visual details).
