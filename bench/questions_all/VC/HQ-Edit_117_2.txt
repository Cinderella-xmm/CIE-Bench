**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a Black woman standing in a warm, rustic kitchen, facing slightly to the right with a joyful expression. She wears a vibrant, patterned African dress with bold geometric and organic motifs in shades of orange, red, yellow, and black, consistent with traditional West African textile designs such as Kente or Ankara. Her hair is styled in a natural afro, wrapped tightly with a matching orange and multicolored headwrap featuring intricate patterns. She accessorizes with large beaded earrings and layered necklaces made of pinkish beads. The kitchen features wooden cabinets, open shelves lined with terracotta pots of varying sizes and shapes, some stacked, others displayed individually. A tiled backsplash in earthy beige tones complements the wooden elements. On the stove, there is a stainless steel pot on a lit burner, emitting steam. To its left, two round wooden boards hold freshly baked bread rolls—golden brown, oval-shaped, and stacked—and a single green cucumber slice rests beside them. The stove has multiple burners and control knobs visible along the front edge. Natural light streams in from a window behind the woman, illuminating her face and casting soft shadows.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instructions specify three distinct postcards derived from this image:  
1. One highlighting **pots with embossed tribal patterns** — implies that the *pots* must remain present, but their surface texture can be modified to include tribal patterns (i.e., new design added).  
2. Another **cartoonizes the vibrant dress with expanded motifs** — indicates that the dress’s form and placement are preserved, but its visual style is altered to cartoon-like exaggeration and larger patterns.  
3. The third features **bread and cucumber transformed into adorable character forms** — means the bread and cucumber are retained in position and function but morphed into anthropomorphic characters.  

From these, we extract the allowed changes:
- The **dress’s pattern and style** may be cartoonized.
- The **pots’ surface texture** may be modified to include embossed tribal patterns.
- The **bread and cucumber** may be transformed into character forms.
- The **overall scene (kitchen)** is implied to be retained as thematic background across all postcards, though not explicitly stated to be unchanged.

However, the instructions do **not** mention changing:
- The **woman’s facial features**, **headwrap**, **earrings**, or **necklaces**.
- The **color palette** of the dress (though motifs may expand).
- The **presence and arrangement of the pots** (only their texture is changed).
- The **stove, wooden shelves, tiles, and lighting** — these are contextual but not mentioned for modification.
- The **position and number of bread rolls and cucumber slice** — only their form is changed.

Thus, any element **not directly mentioned as being transformed** must be assumed to be **retained** unless logically contradicted.

**Allowed Changes List:**
- The surface texture and design of the terracotta pots (to add embossed tribal patterns)
- The visual style of the dress (to become cartoonized with expanded motifs)
- The form and appearance of the bread rolls and cucumber slice (to become character-like figures)
- The overall artistic style of each postcard (e.g., cartoonization, stylization)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
We now apply exclusion logic based on the "Allowed Changes List" to determine what must be preserved.

**Core recognition elements:**  
- The **woman’s identity** relies on key visual traits: her **dark skin tone**, **natural afro hairstyle**, **orange headwrap with multicolored patterns**, **beaded earrings**, and **distinctive smile**. These are irreplaceable for recognition.
- The **dress’s base color scheme** (orange, red, yellow, black) and **general silhouette** (long-sleeved, fitted at waist) are core to cultural identification and visual consistency. While motifs may expand, the foundational colors and shape must remain.
- The **kitchen environment** is essential for thematic coherence: the **wooden shelves**, **terracotta pots**, **tiled backsplash**, **stove**, and **lighting direction** establish context. Changing these would break the "African kitchen theme."
- The **placement of objects** — such as the **pot on the stove**, **bread on wooden board**, **cucumber slice**, and **pots on shelves** — maintains functional logic. Even if forms change, positions must stay consistent.

**Functional/logical association elements:**  
- The **pot on the stove** is actively cooking (indicated by steam), so it must remain on a burner and near the heat source. Its position and function are tied to the scene’s logic.
- The **bread and cucumber** are food items placed on wooden boards; their presence suggests meal preparation. Even when turned into characters, they must retain their **original spatial relationship** to the stove and board.
- The **shelves and pots** form a storage system; altering their layout would disrupt environmental realism.

**Non-modified element deduction:**  
After excluding allowed changes:
- The **woman’s face**, **headwrap**, **jewelry**, **dress shape**, **kitchen structure**, **tile pattern**, **shelf arrangement**, **pot locations**, **stove layout**, and **light source** are all unmentioned for transformation → must be retained.

Even if the dress is cartoonized, its **base shape and color palette** must remain identifiable. Similarly, even if pots gain patterns, their **form and position** must be preserved.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
- The woman’s dark skin tone and facial features (especially her smile and eyes)  
- The orange headwrap with multicolored patterns  
- The beaded earrings and layered necklace  
- The long-sleeved, patterned dress with orange, red, yellow, and black colors  
- The wooden shelves and terracotta pots arranged in rows  
- The tiled backsplash in beige square tiles  
- The stainless steel pot on the stove with visible steam  
- The wooden cutting boards with golden-brown bread rolls and green cucumber slice  
- The position and number of bread rolls (four) and one cucumber slice  
- The stove’s metal surface and control knobs  
- The natural light coming from behind the woman through a window
