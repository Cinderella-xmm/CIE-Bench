Description of reference image:  
The subject is a golden retriever puppy lying comfortably on a light blue dog bed. The puppy has a fluffy golden-brown coat, floppy ears, and expressive dark eyes. Its front paws rest neatly in front of its body, with visible claws on the paw pads. The background includes a beige wall, a black fireplace insert with logs inside, and sheer white curtains allowing soft daylight to enter the room.

### Step 1 - Allowed Changes List:
Specific element 1 that allows for changes  
(The background scene: The beige wall, fireplace, and daylight from the window can be replaced with a snowy mountain campsite setting featuring a tent and snow-covered mountains.)
Specific element 2 that allows for changes  
(The floor beneath the dog bed may be altered as needed to fit the new campsite environment.)

### Step 2 - Preservation Targets List:

Thinking process:
Core recognition elements include the golden retriever puppy's distinctive features, such as its coat color, paw structure, and facial expression, as these are crucial for identifying the subject as a golden retriever even in a different environment. Functional/logical association elements involve the dog bed, as removing it would seem unnatural for the puppy to lie on snow. Remaining elements like the puppy's pose and expression contribute to maintaining visual consistency.

Preservation Targets List:
(Element 1 that should be maintained: The puppy’s coat color and texture)
(Element 2 that should be maintained: The puppy's face and eyes)
(Element 3 that should be maintained: The puppy’s paws, including visible claws)
(Element 4 that should be maintained: The dog bed's appearance and positioning under the puppy)
