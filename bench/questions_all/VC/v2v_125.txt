- Facial features can be exaggerated with oversized, expressive eyes and smooth, rounded shapes.

- The background can be stylized with warm, earthy tones and subtle decorative elements like stars or confetti.

#### Preservation Targets List:
- The subject's beige shirt and its general appearance.
- The horse's brown coat and black bridle.
- The interaction between the subject and the horse (holding reins, proximity).
- The outdoor setting with earthy tones.
