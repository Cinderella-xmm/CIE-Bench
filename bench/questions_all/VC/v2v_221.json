      "thinking_process": "The black-and-white coat pattern is the core identity feature of the Holstein cow, and the instruction explicitly requires retaining it. The specific distribution of patches—especially the large black patch on the left shoulder and the white blaze on the face—is essential for distinguishing this cow from others. Losing this pattern would make the subject unrecognizable as the original cow. Therefore, this is a key identification element with a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the large black patch on the left shoulder of the cow present and clearly defined?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The white blaze running down the center of the cow’s face is a distinctive facial marking that contributes to its identity. It is a consistent feature in Holstein cows and helps distinguish them from other breeds. Since the instruction emphasizes retaining the coat patterns, this facial marking must be preserved. Its absence would alter the cow’s appearance significantly. This is a core recognition element, hence a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Is there a continuous white stripe running down the center of the cow’s face from the forehead to the snout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The horns are a defining physical trait of the cow, and their curved shape with light color and dark tips is a unique detail that contributes to the animal’s identity. The instruction does not allow modification of this feature, so it must be preserved. Changing the horn shape or color would misrepresent the original subject. This is a core recognition element, thus assigned 3 points.",
      "question": "Are the cow’s horns curved upward and outward, with a light base and dark tips?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The vintage CRT television is a key object in the scene and is explicitly mentioned in the instruction. Its design—specifically the speaker grille on the right side and the control knobs at the bottom—is essential for identifying it as a retro TV. Although its position changes, its form must remain recognizable. This is a functional and iconic element, so it is assigned 2 points.",
      "question": "Does the television have a speaker grille on the right side and multiple control knobs at the bottom?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The cow’s hooves must be placed on the TV screen as per the instruction. This establishes a logical interaction between the subject and the object. The presence of the hooves on the screen is a functional requirement and must be preserved to maintain scene coherence. This is an important scene element, so it is assigned 2 points.",
      "question": "Are both front hooves of the cow positioned on top of the television screen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The grassy field and sky with clouds provide the environmental context. While the instruction allows stylization, the basic elements—green grass and a blue sky with white clouds—must remain to preserve the outdoor setting. The grass texture and cloud shapes are secondary but contribute to visual consistency. This is a minor detail, so it is assigned 1 point.",
      "question": "Is the background composed of a green grassy field under a blue sky with white clouds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The cow’s nose is a key facial feature, with a pinkish-brown color and visible nostrils. This detail contributes to the realism and identity of the animal. Although the style may change, the color and structure of the nose should be preserved. This is a minor but identifiable detail, so it is assigned 1 point.",
      "question": "Is the cow’s nose pinkish-brown with clearly visible nostrils?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
