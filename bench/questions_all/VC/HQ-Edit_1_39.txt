**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a potted cactus placed on a wooden windowsill inside a rustic structure, viewed through a rectangular window framed by weathered wood and stone. The cactus is green with bright red spines and sits in a terracotta pot adorned with geometric black-and-white patterns around its upper rim. A traditional Mexican sombrero, decorated with colorful embroidered floral patterns in pink, yellow, blue, and green, rests atop the cactus. The background reveals a desert landscape under a clear blue sky with scattered clouds, featuring distant mountains, sparse vegetation, and several tall saguaro-like cacti. The lighting is natural daylight, casting sharp shadows from the pot and the window frame onto the wooden surface.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instructions explicitly transform the cactus into a whimsical desert guardian creature. Key changes include:
- **Morphing the cactus body** into a creature with ornate, patterned scales reflecting the sombrero’s embroidery.
- **Replacing the pot** with a rugged, stone-like base serving as feet.
- **Transforming the spines** into shimmering golden quills.
- **Adding a flowing sandy aura** around the creature.
- **Introducing glowing topaz-like eyes** that exude a serene presence.

These transformations directly alter the **form, material, and function** of the original subject (the cactus and pot). However, the instructions do **not** mention changing the **scene**, **window framing**, **background desert**, or **lighting conditions**. Therefore, while the subject undergoes radical morphing, the **environmental context must remain consistent** unless stated otherwise.

**Allowed Changes List:**
- The form and structure of the cactus (transformed into a creature)
- The texture and color of the spines (changed to golden quills)
- The pot (replaced with stone-like feet)
- The addition of new features: eyes, aura, scales
- The overall identity of the plant (from cactus to creature)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
We now exclude the allowed changes to identify what **must be preserved** based on:

1. **Core recognition elements**: These are essential for identifying the original image’s unique visual signature. Even if transformed, certain **iconic visual markers** must remain recognizable unless replaced entirely. For example, the **sombrero’s decorative embroidery** is referenced in the transformation (scales reflect it), so its **design and color scheme** must persist—though not necessarily in the same location. Similarly, the **desert environment** is critical for contextual coherence.

2. **Functional/logical association elements**: The **position of the object within the window frame** is key—it is centered, visible through the opening, and casts a shadow. Changing this would break spatial logic. Also, the **relationship between the object and the background** (cactus facing outward, desert behind) must be preserved to maintain scene rationality.

3. **Non-modified element deduction**: After excluding all allowed changes, we retain:
   - The **window frame’s shape and material** (wooden beams and stone pillars)
   - The **desert landscape** including distant mountains, sky, clouds, and other cacti
   - The **lighting direction and shadows** (sunlight coming from the right, casting leftward shadows)
   - The **color palette of the sky and terrain** (blue sky, pale tan desert, distant purple-blue mountains)
   - The **relative position of the object** on the sill

Even though the cactus is transformed, the **contextual setting** is not mentioned for change, so it must remain unchanged.

**Preservation Targets List:**
- The wooden window frame with stone supports
- The desert landscape visible through the window (including mountains, sky, clouds, and other cacti)
- The lighting condition (bright sunlight from the right, casting distinct shadows)
- The position of the object on the wooden windowsill
- The color and texture of the sky and distant terrain
- The silhouette and placement of the background cacti
- The orientation and composition of the scene (object centered in frame, view outwards)

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Retained Visual Elements**

Q1:  
Thinking process: The wooden window frame with its horizontal beam and vertical stone pillars is a defining architectural feature of the scene. Its shape, material, and placement are critical for maintaining the original setting. If removed or altered, the entire spatial context collapses. This is a core structural element anchoring the composition, thus earning a weight of 3 points.  
Question: Is the rectangular wooden window frame with stone pillars on both sides present and unaltered?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The desert landscape beyond the window, including the distant mountains and scattered cacti, provides essential environmental context. Removing or altering these would break the thematic consistency of the scene. The presence of specific elements like the tall saguaro-like cacti confirms the desert setting. This is a major scene element affecting overall coherence, hence a weight of 2 points.  
Question: Are the distant mountains and multiple upright cacti visible in the background beyond the window?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The lighting direction and shadow cast by the pot and window frame are crucial for visual realism and depth. The sunlight comes from the right, casting shadows to the left, which defines the time of day and spatial orientation. Altering this would disrupt the scene’s logic and consistency. This is an important environmental cue, so it earns 2 points.  
Question: Is the shadow of the pot cast to the left on the wooden sill, indicating sunlight from the right?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The color of the sky is a key atmospheric element—clear blue with soft white clouds. This establishes the time of day and weather. Changing it would alter the mood and realism of the scene. While not the central subject, it is a vital backdrop detail that contributes to authenticity. Thus, it is a significant but secondary element, earning 1 point.  
Question: Is the sky above the desert a clear blue with scattered white clouds?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The wooden surface of the windowsill, including its grain and wear marks, contributes to the rustic aesthetic. It serves as the base for the subject and interacts with light and shadow. Though minor compared to the frame or landscape, it maintains tactile realism and continuity. This is a detail-level element, so it receives 1 point.  
Question: Is the windowsill made of weathered wooden planks with visible grain and cracks?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The relative positioning of the subject (potted cactus) within the center of the window frame is essential for compositional balance. Even after transformation, the creature must occupy the same spatial location to preserve visual continuity. This ensures the edited image remains grounded in the original layout. It is a logical placement anchor, thus worth 2 points.  
Question: Is the transformed creature positioned centrally within the window frame, on the windowsill?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The texture and color of the distant terrain—dry, pale tan with low scrub vegetation—are characteristic of a desert biome. Preserving this ensures the environment remains authentic and consistent with the original. While subtle, this detail reinforces the setting. It is a supporting environmental feature, so it earns 1 point.  
Question: Is the ground beyond the window a flat, arid desert terrain with sparse dry grass and shrubs?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1
