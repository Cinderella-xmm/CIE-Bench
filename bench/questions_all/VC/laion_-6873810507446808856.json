      "thinking_process": "The stacked structure of two pancakes is the core identity feature—without this, the subject would not be recognizable as pancakes. The vertical alignment and relative size difference between the two layers are essential for identifying the stack. Even in cartoon form, this configuration must be preserved to maintain recognition. This is a 3-point element because it defines the subject.",
      "question": "Are there two vertically stacked pancake layers, with the bottom one slightly larger than the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The golden-yellow color of the pancakes is a key visual identifier distinguishing them from other breakfast foods. Even in a whimsical style, the dominant yellow hue must remain to preserve the pancake identity. Losing this color would make the subject unrecognizable as pancakes. This is a 3-point element due to its role in core identification.",
      "question": "Do the pancakes retain a dominant golden-yellow color throughout their visible surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The rectangular pat of butter is a distinct object in the original image, positioned centrally on the top pancake. Its presence and shape are crucial for continuity—even when reimagined as a hat, its form must be traceable. Removing or altering its shape would break visual consistency with the source.",
      "question": "Is there a solid, rectangular pat of pale yellow butter placed on the top pancake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The syrup is shown as an amber-colored liquid being poured from a pitcher. Its color and fluid motion are key features. Even when transformed into a \"cape,\" the syrup must retain its golden hue and liquid state to maintain logical continuity. Loss of color or texture would disrupt the connection to the original.",
      "question": "Is there a visible stream of amber-colored syrup flowing from a pitcher onto the pancakes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The white plate with a light blue rim is a consistent environmental anchor. Though the background may change, the plate serves as a base and provides visual framing. Its presence ensures the scene remains grounded in the original context. Altering its color or removing it would affect compositional coherence.",
      "question": "Is the pancake stack placed on a white plate with a light blue rim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The porous, fluffy texture of the pancake interiors, especially visible at the edges, is a distinctive detail that separates these pancakes from denser baked goods. This texture contributes to their realistic appearance and should be preserved even in stylized form to maintain authenticity.",
      "question": "Are the inner sides of the pancakes visibly porous and airy, showing a spongy texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The direction of syrup flow—from the pitcher above to the top pancake—is a functional and dynamic element. Even in a comic, the syrup must originate from above and flow downward to maintain logical continuity. Reversing or omitting this flow would misrepresent the original action.",
      "question": "Does the syrup stream originate from above the stack and flow downward onto the top pancake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
