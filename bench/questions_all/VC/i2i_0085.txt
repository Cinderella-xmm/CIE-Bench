Description of reference image: The subject is a cozy living room setting featuring a beige sofa with multiple cushions of varying shades of beige and yellow. Above the sofa, there is a framed wall painting depicting a serene autumn landscape with trees in orange and yellow hues along a reflective riverbank under a setting sun. The room has a light-colored herringbone-patterned floor and some plants to the left, with natural light streaming in from the right. The overall scene conveys warmth and calmness.

### Step 1: Carefully read the editing instructions and analyze the modification requirements

Thinking process: The instruction specifically asks to create a 3D effect for the wall painting, making it appear as if it blends into the real space. This involves altering the boundaries of the painting while maintaining key visual elements. There is no mention of changing the paintingâ€™s content (trees, river, sun) or the room's general setup (sofa, pillows, floor, lighting).

Allowed Changes List:
1. The frame of the painting can be altered or removed to create a 3D effect.
2. The edges of the painting can be distorted to blend into the room, possibly adding shadows or reflections.
3. The perspective of the painting can be adjusted slightly to enhance the 3D blending effect.

### Step 2: Determine the elements that should remain unchanged

Thinking process:
- **Core recognition elements:** The key features of the painting (orange-yellow trees, river, sunset) need to stay intact because they provide the identity of the picture. The sofa's design and cushion arrangement are also key to the room's identity.
- **Functional/logical association elements:** The placement of the sofa beneath the painting and the alignment with the wall must remain consistent for logical coherence.
- **Remaining elements based on visual coherence:** The room's lighting, the plant to the left, and the herringbone floor pattern should be maintained to keep the scene visually coherent.

Preservation Targets List:
- The content and colors of the painting (trees, river, sunset)
- The sofa's design and cushion arrangement
- The sofa's position relative to the wall
- The room's lighting and plant location
- The herringbone floor pattern

### Step 3: Generate questions focusing on key identifying visual elements

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The painting's content is a core element since it defines the artwork. Losing any part of this would make the image lose its identity.
    Question: Is the painting still depicting orange-yellow trees along a river under a setting sun?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The sofa and its cushions are central to the room's character. Their design and arrangement are crucial for maintaining the scene's identity.
    Question: Does the sofa still have beige cushions with a yellow accent pillow?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The sofa's position relative to the wall is a functional element that ensures spatial coherence.
    Question: Is the sofa still positioned directly below the wall painting?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: Room lighting is a subtle but important detail that contributes to the overall ambiance.
    Question: Is the room still illuminated by natural light coming from the right side?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The herringbone floor pattern is a minor detail that adds to the room's aesthetic. Loss of this detail may slightly affect visual consistency.
    Question: Is the floor still covered with a light herringbone-patterned material?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
