Description of reference image: The subject is a female scientist in a modern laboratory setting, positioned slightly to the left of center and facing right. She has dark hair tied back in a neat ponytail, with a few loose strands framing her face. She wears round, thin-rimmed glasses and a white lab coat over a high-necked white shirt. Her posture is upright and focused, with her right hand holding a fine glass pipette or probe, angled downward toward a test tube rack. In front of her are multiple rows of test tubes arranged in metal racks, filled with varying shades of teal liquid. The background features a sleek, futuristic lab environment with illuminated panels, transparent glass walls, digital screens displaying complex molecular structures (in blue-green hues), and advanced equipment including a microscope on the right. The lighting is cool and clinical, dominated by whites and teals, creating a clean, high-tech atmosphere. The overall composition emphasizes precision, science, and technological advancement.

Thinking process:  
First, analyze the editing instructions word by word:  
- "Design a themed calendar featuring the laboratory scientist" → implies transformation into a semi-cartoon style, but the core subject (the scientist) must still be recognizable.  
- "Semi-cartoon style" → allows stylization of form, proportions, and textures; thus, realistic rendering can be altered.  
- "Emphasizing refined laboratory apparatus and posture" → indicates that **apparatus** and **posture** should remain identifiable and central.  
- "Utilize teal and white tones for a sleek scientific aesthetic" → color palette may be adjusted to emphasize these tones, but **original dominant colors (teal/white)** are not being replaced, so they may be retained or enhanced.  
- "Each month highlights a different scientific motif" → suggests new content will be added per month, but the **core figure and scene layout** should remain consistent across months.  
- "Bold tech-inspired headers and integrated data visualization patterns" → implies overlay of text and graphics, but **these are additions**, not replacements of existing elements.  
- "High-quality gloss paper for modern appeal" → refers to print medium, not visual content.  

From this, we deduce:  
- The **subject’s identity** (female scientist) and **key pose** (holding pipette, standing at lab bench) must remain recognizable.  
- The **laboratory apparatus** (test tubes, racks, microscope, digital displays) must remain present and logically positioned.  
- The **color scheme** (teal and white) is emphasized, so it may be preserved or intensified, but not fundamentally changed.  
- The **semi-cartoon style** allows changes to texture, shading, and line work, but **core forms and spatial relationships** must be maintained.  
- **New elements** like monthly headers and data visuals are to be overlaid, not replace existing ones.  

Allowed Changes List:  
- Artistic style: transformation to semi-cartoon (e.g., simplified lines, exaggerated proportions, flat shading).  
- Texture details: surface textures of lab coat, glassware, etc., may be stylized.  
- Lighting intensity and contrast: may be adjusted for stylistic effect.  
- Background complexity: digital displays may be simplified or reimagined as abstract data patterns.  
- Facial features: may be softened or stylized, but identity must remain clear.  
- Proportions: slight exaggeration allowed (e.g., larger eyes, smaller nose), but not beyond recognition.  
- Additional graphic elements: bold headers, data motifs, calendar grids—these are new and not part of original image.  

Step 2 – Determine the elements that should remain unchanged  
Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements:  
- The **scientist’s posture** (standing, right hand holding pipette, head slightly tilted down) is essential to identify her action and role. If lost, she becomes unrecognizable as a scientist conducting research.  
- The **test tubes in racks** are iconic symbols of laboratory work. Their presence and arrangement define the scene as a lab. Changing their number, shape, or position would disrupt the logical function of the space.  
- The **microscope** on the right side is a functional object linked to scientific observation. Its presence maintains the realism of the lab environment.  
- The **digital screens** showing molecular structures are key to establishing the high-tech context. These are not generic displays but show specific scientific imagery (symmetrical, circular patterns resembling viral capsids or crystal lattices), which contribute to the theme.  
- The **lab coat** and **glasses** are standard identifiers of a scientist. While style may change, their presence and basic form must remain.  

Functional/logical association elements:  
- The **pipette held in the right hand** must remain connected to the action of transferring liquid—this is a functional gesture. If removed or replaced with another tool, the narrative of experimentation is broken.  
- The **spatial relationship** between the scientist and the test tubes (she is leaning forward, looking at them) establishes her engagement with the experiment. This layout must be preserved to maintain logical coherence.  
- The **position of the microscope** relative to the workbench and digital screens must stay consistent—it’s part of the workflow setup.  

Non-modified element deduction:  
After excluding allowed changes (style, texture, lighting), the following must remain:  
- The **shape and arrangement of test tubes** (vertical, grouped in racks).  
- The **presence of the microscope** with its eyepiece and stage visible.  
- The **molecular diagrams on screens**—their circular, symmetrical, lattice-like structure is unique and must be preserved.  
- The **color of the liquids in test tubes** (teal/greenish-blue) is part of the visual theme and must be retained.  
- The **overall layout**: scientist in foreground, benches below, screens behind—this spatial hierarchy defines the scene.  

Preservation Targets List:  
- The scientist’s posture (standing, right hand holding pipette, head slightly down)  
- The test tube racks with teal-colored liquids  
- The microscope on the right side of the bench  
- The digital screens displaying circular molecular structures  
- The lab coat and glasses worn by the scientist  
- The color of the liquids in test tubes (teal/blue-green)  
- The spatial arrangement: scientist in front, test tubes in front of her, microscope to her right, screens behind  

Q1:  
Thinking process: The scientist's posture—specifically, her right hand holding a pipette while looking down at the test tubes—is the core functional gesture indicating scientific activity. This is not just a pose but a behavioral identifier of her role. If this action is altered (e.g., hands empty, no pipette), the image loses its narrative coherence and identity as a researcher at work. It is a key identity feature, making it a 3-point element.  
Question: Is the scientist depicted with her right hand holding a pipette or similar instrument, angled toward the test tubes?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The test tube racks with teal-colored liquids are central to the laboratory setting. Their vertical alignment and grouping in metal racks are distinctive and functional. Removing or altering their shape or color would undermine the scientific context. The teal color is also specified in the instruction as a key tone, so its retention is critical. This is a core scene element, hence 3 points.  
Question: Are there multiple test tubes arranged in metal racks, containing teal or greenish-blue liquid?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The microscope on the right side of the bench is a functional object tied to scientific observation. Its presence grounds the scene in realism and supports the scientist’s role. Even in semi-cartoon style, its silhouette and position must be preserved to maintain logical consistency. This is an important scene element, so weight is 2.  
Question: Is there a microscope visible on the right side of the workbench, with an eyepiece and stage clearly defined?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The digital screens behind the scientist display distinct circular, symmetrical molecular structures—these are not generic patterns but specific scientific visuals that define the high-tech lab. They are iconic representations of research data and must be preserved to maintain thematic integrity. Their loss would remove a key contextual clue. This is a 2-point element due to its importance in scene identification.  
Question: Are there two digital screens in the background displaying circular, intricate, symmetrical molecular or crystalline patterns in blue-green tones?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The lab coat and glasses are signature attire of a scientist. While style may be cartoonified, their presence is essential for identity recognition. Without them, the character could be misread as a technician or student. This is a core identity feature, hence 3 points.  
Question: Does the scientist wear a white lab coat and round-framed glasses?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The color of the liquids in the test tubes—specifically teal or greenish-blue—is a key part of the instructed aesthetic ("teal and white tones"). This color choice is not incidental but intentional for visual cohesion. Altering it to another hue would break the intended scientific aesthetic. Though not a structural element, it is a critical detail for visual consistency, so it is a 2-point element.  
Question: Are the liquids in the test tubes colored in shades of teal or greenish-blue?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The spatial layout—scientist in front, test tubes in front of her, microscope to her right, screens behind—defines the scene’s logic. Changing this arrangement (e.g., moving the microscope to the left) would disrupt the functional flow of the lab. This is a key compositional element, affecting how the viewer interprets the environment. Therefore, it is a 2-point element.  
Question: Is the scientist positioned in front of the test tubes, with the microscope to her right and digital screens behind her?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2
