Description of reference image: The subject is a stack of five cinnamon-sugar-coated donuts arranged on a white scalloped-edge plate. The donuts are golden-brown in color, with a textured surface covered in coarse granulated sugar and cinnamon, giving them a slightly rough and sparkling appearance. Each donut has a circular hole in the center, typical of standard ring-shaped baked goods. The lighting is soft and diffused, casting gentle shadows beneath the plate, which rests on a plain white surface. The background is uniformly white, clean, and uncluttered, emphasizing the donuts as the central focus. The composition is slightly angled, with the front-most donut partially overlapping others, creating depth. The texture of the sugar coating is visible under close inspection, showing individual granules adhering to the dough surface. The plate's edge has a delicate wavy pattern, adding subtle detail to the otherwise minimal setting.

Thinking process:  
First, analyze the editing instructions word by word:  
- "Create a whimsical comic strip titled 'The Donut Defense Chronicles' in a pop-art style." → This indicates a complete transformation of the image into a narrative comic format; thus, the original photograph’s structure and realism are not required to be preserved.  
- "Turn each donut in the image into a round, jolly warrior—sugar-crusted armor, doughy limbs, expressive icing eyes." → This explicitly transforms the **form** of the donuts from passive food items into anthropomorphic characters. Therefore, their **physical form**, including shape, texture, and role, is allowed to change significantly.  
- "Panel 1: A donut makes an urgent rallying cry..." → Introduces new scene content (a dialogue bubble, action pose), implying that **scene context** can be replaced entirely.  
- "Panel 2: Mobilized donuts unite around a massive coffee mug fortress..." → Adds a new environment (coffee mug fortress), so the **background and spatial arrangement** are not required to remain.  
- "Include playful fonts; keep the tone light and adventurous." → Style and typography are to be changed, confirming artistic reinterpretation is permitted.  

Thus, the following elements are **allowed to change**:  
- The physical form of the donuts (now anthropomorphized warriors)  
- Their texture (sugar coating may be reinterpreted as armor)  
- Their position and interaction (stacked pile → dynamic group formation)  
- The plate and its design (may be removed or stylized)  
- The background (white surface → comic-style backdrop)  
- Lighting and shadows (realistic → flat pop-art shading)  
- Overall composition (photographic still → multi-panel comic layout)  

Allowed Changes List:  
- Form and posture of donuts (transformed into warriors)  
- Texture interpretation (sugar crust → armor)  
- Presence and design of the plate  
- Background environment (white surface → comic panels)  
- Number and arrangement of donuts (may be increased or rearranged for storytelling)  
- Color scheme (may shift toward bold pop-art palette)  
- Addition of non-existent elements (dialogue bubbles, coffee mug fortress, marshmallow spears, etc.)

Thinking process:  
Now determine what **must remain unchanged** based on exclusion and core identity logic:

1. **Core recognition elements**:  
   - While the donuts will be transformed into warriors, the **original visual identity of the donuts must still be recognizable** — specifically, their **ring shape**, **golden-brown color**, and **cinnamon-sugar coating**. These are key identifiers of the object type. Even if anthropomorphized, the character must still resemble a donut. Thus, the **circular form with a central hole**, **coloration**, and **sugary texture** must be preserved in some form.  
   - The **texture of the sugar coating** is a distinctive feature — it is coarse, granular, and unevenly distributed, not smooth glaze. This texture is essential to identify the donut as a *cinnamon-sugar* variety rather than glazed or chocolate-covered.  
   - The **overall brown hue** of the baked dough must remain, as it defines the base material.

2. **Functional/logical association elements**:  
   - Although the scene changes, the **relationship between the donuts and the plate** is not explicitly required to be preserved. However, since the plate is part of the original presentation and could serve as a symbolic element (e.g., “plate” becomes “battlefield”), it might be retained in concept but not necessarily visually. But no instruction requires retention, so it can be changed.  
   - No functional logic binds the donuts beyond being edible objects — their function is now narrative (warriors), so functional elements are not relevant.

3. **Non-modified element deduction**:  
   - The **number of donuts** is not specified in the instruction as fixed — it says “each donut,” implying all present are used, but quantity may vary for storytelling.  
   - The **exact arrangement** is not required — stacking is only for visual appeal in the original.  
   - The **lighting direction** or **shadow cast** is not referenced, so these can change.  
   - The **white background** is not required to be preserved — it’s just a neutral canvas.  

However, **the core visual traits** of the donuts — especially the **ring shape**, **central hole**, **golden-brown color**, and **granulated sugar coating** — are essential to maintain recognition. Without them, the characters would not be identifiable as donuts, breaking the thematic link to the original image.

Preservation Targets List:  
- The circular shape of the donuts with a central hole  
- The golden-brown color of the baked dough  
- The presence of coarse granulated sugar coating on the surface  
- The texture of the sugar (visible granules, not smooth)  
- The overall ring-like form (not filled or solid)

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The circular shape with a central hole is the defining geometric feature of a donut. If this shape is altered (e.g., filled in, reshaped into a sphere), the object loses its identity as a donut. This is a core recognition element, essential for identifying the subject. Losing it would make the character unrecognizable as a donut, even in cartoon form. Therefore, it must be preserved.
    Question: Is the donut-shaped object retaining a circular form with a central hole?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3

{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The golden-brown color of the baked dough is a key identifier of the donut’s base material. In the original image, this color distinguishes it from other types of pastries. Even in pop-art style, changing it to bright red or blue would misrepresent the original object. This color is essential for maintaining visual continuity and recognition.
    Question: Does the donut retain its golden-brown baked color?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The coarse granulated sugar coating is a distinctive texture that differentiates this donut from glazed or frosted varieties. Its presence is a core visual trait in the original image. If replaced with smooth icing or omitted entirely, the donut’s identity as a cinnamon-sugar variety is lost. Thus, this texture must be preserved in some form, even if stylized.
    Question: Is the surface of the donut covered in visible coarse granulated sugar?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The sugar coating’s texture includes individual granules that are visibly scattered across the surface. This granular quality is not just decorative but diagnostic — it confirms the type of donut. If the texture is smoothed out or replaced with uniform shading, the key detail is lost. This level of detail supports authenticity and should be maintained.
    Question: Are there visible individual sugar granules on the donut’s surface?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The ring-like form, where the dough forms a continuous loop with a hole, is fundamental to the donut’s structure. Even if limbs are added, the body must still reflect this ring shape. If the donut becomes a solid disk or irregular blob, it fails to represent the original. This structural integrity is crucial for recognition.
    Question: Is the donut’s body formed as a continuous ring with a central opening?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
