      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "The presence of four rotors is the defining structural feature of a quadcopter. Removing or altering their number would fundamentally change the drone’s identity. Even when converted into arms, the count and radial arrangement must remain consistent to retain functional logic and recognition. This is a core identity element, so loss would make the original object unrecognizable, justifying a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Are there exactly four rotor assemblies arranged symmetrically around the central body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The yellow triangular accents are unique visual markers on the drone’s body, serving as both aesthetic and brand identifiers. They appear at specific locations (top, sides, rear), and their angular shape matches the drone’s aggressive design language. Altering or removing them would reduce visual fidelity to the original model. While not essential for basic identification, they are key distinguishing details, hence assigned 2 points.",
      "question": "Are there yellow triangular markings present on the top and side surfaces of the central body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The V-shaped landing gear is a structural hallmark of the drone’s design, providing balance and protection. Although transformed into spider-like legs, the underlying V-form must be preserved to maintain continuity with the original. Its geometric shape is a key detail that links the original object to the transformed character. Thus, it is an important structural element, warranting 2 points.",
      "question": "Are the landing supports shaped like V-forms at each corner of the drone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The angular, sharp-edged design of the central body defines the drone’s futuristic and mechanical aesthetic. This silhouette is crucial for maintaining the visual identity of the device. Even when stylized into a face, the sharp lines and polygonal forms must persist to ensure coherence with the original. This is a core design trait, so it receives 3 points.",
      "question": "Does the central body feature sharp, angular edges and a polygonal structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The three rectangular battery indicator lights are a unique interface feature visible on the top surface. They are not just decorative but represent a functional component of the drone. In the edited version, they might be repurposed as eyes or status displays, but their presence and layout must be preserved to maintain technical authenticity. As a minor but identifiable detail, it earns 1 point.",
      "question": "Are there three small rectangular lights aligned horizontally on the top surface of the central body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The black base color with yellow highlights is the primary color scheme of the drone. While the instruction allows artistic freedom, the contrast between black and yellow is essential for visual recognition. If the colors are completely changed (e.g., to red and blue), the connection to the original model is lost. Since this is a key branding and identity element, it is assigned 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the drone predominantly black with yellow accent markings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
