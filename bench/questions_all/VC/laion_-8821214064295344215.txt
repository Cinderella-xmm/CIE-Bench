Description of reference image: The subject consists of two crocheted teddy bears seated side by side on a wooden surface against a white brick wall background. The bear on the left is primarily brown with a yellow knitted bow on its head, wearing a yellow polka-dotted sweater with a matching yellow ribbon tied around its neck. Its paws and lower legs are yellow, contrasting with the brown upper body. The bear on the right is light beige in color, wearing a turquoise knitted sweater with a teal satin ribbon tied into a bow at the neck. Its paws and lower legs are turquoise, matching the sweater. Both bears have round, textured crochet bodies with visible stitch patterns, small black button eyes, brown embroidered noses, and white snouts. Their ears are rounded and slightly protruding. The overall posture is upright and symmetrical, facing forward with arms resting at their sides. The background features a clean white brick wall with even mortar lines, and the floor is made of weathered gray wood planks with visible grain and texture.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions to determine what elements are explicitly allowed to change. The instruction states: “Transform the teddy bears into mosaic figurines, using small colorful tiles to mimic fur texture.” This means the **form** of the bears (from crocheted plush to mosaic) can be changed — thus, the **texture**, **material**, and **construction method** of the bears are allowed to change.  
“Replace the knitted sweaters with intricate tile patterns in yellow and turquoise hues” — so the **sweaters’ material and appearance** can be modified, but not necessarily their **color scheme or placement**.  
“Recreate their facial features with subtly shaded tiles for detail” — facial features may be reinterpreted but must remain recognizable.  
“Ensure the bows appear in glossy, smooth tiles for contrast” — the **bows’ appearance** changes, but their **presence and position** are implied to be preserved.  
“Position the mosaic bears on a minimalistic white pedestal to highlight artistic craftsmanship” — this indicates that the **background scene is being replaced** entirely, including the wooden floor and brick wall.  

Thus, the **allowed changes list** includes:
- The texture and construction method of the bears (crochet → mosaic)
- The material and visual style of the sweaters (knitted → tiled)
- The material and finish of the bows (fabric → glossy tiles)
- The background setting (wooden floor + brick wall → white pedestal)

However, the **identity of the subjects** (two seated teddy bears), their **relative positioning**, **colors** (yellow/turquoise vs. brown/beige), **facial features**, **bow locations**, **paw colors**, and **overall pose** are not mentioned as being altered — only transformed in medium. Therefore, these aspects must be retained in form and function, even if rendered differently.

Allowed Changes List:
- Texture and material of the bears' bodies (crochet → mosaic)
- Material and pattern of sweaters (knitted → tiled)
- Material and sheen of bows (fabric → glossy tiles)
- Background environment (wooden floor and brick wall → white pedestal)

Step 2 – Determine the elements that should remain unchanged

Thinking process:
Core recognition elements: The identity of the figures as **teddy bears** depends on key features such as **round heads, small ears, snout shape, black button eyes, stitched nose, and soft rounded limbs**. These are essential for recognition. Even if rendered in mosaic, the **shape and structure** must remain consistent to preserve identity. The **pairing** of two bears, one with yellow accents and one with turquoise, is also a core identity feature. The **positioning** (side-by-side, facing forward) is crucial for maintaining the original composition and emotional tone.

Functional/logical association elements: The **relationship between the bears** — sitting closely together, symmetrically posed — implies companionship. This spatial relationship must be preserved to maintain narrative coherence. The **placement of accessories** (bow on head, ribbon on chest) is functional; changing their location would alter the character design.

Non-modified element deduction: Elements not mentioned for change — such as **the presence of a yellow bow on the left bear’s head**, **the turquoise ribbon on the right bear’s chest**, **the yellow paws on the left bear**, **turquoise paws on the right**, **white snouts**, **brown noses**, **black eyes**, and **seated posture** — must be retained because they define the individual identities of each bear. The **color coding** (left = yellow theme, right = turquoise theme) is central to distinguishing them and should be preserved in hue, even if texture changes.

Preservation Targets List:
- The presence and position of the yellow bow on the left bear's head
- The presence and position of the turquoise ribbon on the right bear's chest
- The color of the left bear’s paws (yellow) and the right bear’s paws (turquoise)
- The white snout and brown nose on both bears
- The black button eyes on both bears
- The seated, upright posture of both bears
- The relative positioning of the two bears (side-by-side, facing forward)
- The round head and ear shape of both bears
- The symmetry and proportion of the limbs and body

    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The yellow bow on the left bear's head is a defining accessory that distinguishes it from the right bear. It is located on the top-left side of the head and is a key visual identifier. If removed or relocated, the character identity is compromised. This is a core recognition feature due to its unique placement and color contrast.
    Question: Is there a yellow bow present on the head of the left teddy bear?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The turquoise ribbon tied around the neck of the right bear is a signature element that matches its sweater and contrasts with the left bear. Its presence and position are essential for identifying the bear’s thematic color and accessory pairing. Removing it would break the visual logic of the design.
    Question: Is there a turquoise ribbon tied around the neck of the right teddy bear?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The paw coloration is a critical differentiator: the left bear has yellow paws, the right has turquoise. This color consistency across limbs reinforces the thematic design and must be preserved even in mosaic form to maintain visual identity.
    Question: Do the paws of the left teddy bear have yellow coloring?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The right bear’s paws are distinctly turquoise, matching its sweater and ribbon. This color coordination is part of its identity and must remain consistent to preserve the intended aesthetic and character distinction.
    Question: Do the paws of the right teddy bear have turquoise coloring?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3

{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The black button eyes are a standard feature of teddy bear design and are essential for facial recognition. Their position and color are fixed in the original image and must be preserved in any transformation to maintain the bear-like appearance.
    Question: Are both teddy bears equipped with black button eyes?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The white snout and brown nose are characteristic facial features that define the bear’s expression and species identity. Altering these would make the figure unrecognizable as a bear. They are core to the animal’s morphology.
    Question: Do both teddy bears have white snouts with brown noses?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The seated, upright posture with arms at the sides is a key compositional element. Changing the pose would disrupt the symmetry and balance of the image, affecting the intended presentation of the pair.
    Question: Are both teddy bears sitting upright with their arms resting at their sides?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2

{
    Q8: 
    Thinking process: The relative positioning of the two bears — side-by-side, facing forward, with no overlap — is essential for maintaining the visual harmony and narrative of companionship. This spatial relationship must be preserved.
    Question: Are the two teddy bears positioned side-by-side, facing forward?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2

{
    Q9: 
    Thinking process: The round head and rounded ears are iconic features of teddy bears. Altering their shape would make the figures unrecognizable. These shapes are fundamental to the species representation.
    Question: Do both teddy bears have round heads and rounded ears?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
