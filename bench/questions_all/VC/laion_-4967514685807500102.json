      "thinking_process": "The pink-orange hue of the shrimp is the primary visual identifier of cooked seafood in this context. If the shrimp were rendered in gray or white, they would no longer resemble the original dish. This color is essential for maintaining the culinary identity of the subject. Loss of this feature would make the edited version unrecognizable as derived from the original shrimp dish, thus affecting the core reference. Therefore, it is assigned a weight of 3.",
      "question": "Are the shrimp rendered in a pink-orange color consistent with cooked shrimp?",

        "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The red spice coating (likely paprika or cayenne) is a defining characteristic of the dish’s seasoning. Its presence distinguishes it from plain boiled shrimp. In the comic, even if stylized, the red speckling must be present to maintain the \"spicy\" theme. Removing it would contradict the \"spicy adventure\" premise and break the link to the original image. This makes it a critical functional element tied to both flavor and visual identity.",
      "question": "Is there visible red spice coating on the shrimp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The lemon wedges are key flavor components and narrative devices in the comic. Their yellow color, triangular shape, and rind texture are essential for identification. If replaced with lime or depicted without rind, they would lose their connection to the original dish. Since the lemon is central to the \"zest of life\" speech bubble, its visual fidelity is crucial for consistency.",
      "question": "Are there yellow lemon wedges with visible rind and pulp in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The green herbs (parsley or cilantro) are scattered over the shrimp and pan. They contribute to the dish’s freshness and flavor profile. In the comic, they become active elements (\"hovering herb sprinkles\"), so their green color and fine leafy texture must be preserved. Changing them to another herb (like dill) or making them blue would disrupt the visual logic and weaken the reference to the original image.",
      "question": "Are there finely chopped green herbs visible on and around the shrimp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The curled shape of the shrimp is a natural result of cooking and is iconic for this preparation. Even when anthropomorphized, the character should retain the basic C-shaped body. If the shrimp were straight or elongated, it would no longer resemble the original specimen. This shape is a structural identifier and must be maintained for visual coherence.",
      "question": "Do the shrimp maintain a curled, C-shaped form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The stainless steel pan and marble countertop are part of the original scene but are not required in the comic. However, since the instructions do not require their removal and instead focus on transforming the content, their absence in the final product is acceptable. But if the pan were retained in the comic, its metallic sheen and rivets could serve as a stylistic anchor. However, since the instruction does not mandate their preservation, they are not included in the retention list. Thus, this question is not applicable.",
      "question": "Is the stainless steel pan with rivets present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
