      "thinking_process": "The daffodils in the flowerbed are central to the thematic transformation described in the instruction (“daffodil superheroes”).

      "thinking_process": "The relative positioning of the five individuals — standing in a straight line from left to right in the same order — is crucial for maintaining scene coherence.
