      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "The number of arms is a fundamental identifier of an octopus. An octopus has exactly eight arms; changing this number would make the subject unrecognizable as an octopus. Since the instruction transforms the octopus into sculptures but does not specify altering limb count, the number of arms must remain eight. This is a core identity feature, and losing it would violate the subject's biological definition.",
      "question": "Does the edited image depict exactly eight arms extending from the central head mass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The presence of a central head mass is essential for identifying the subject as an octopus. Without it, the sculpture would appear as a cluster of disconnected tentacles, losing the iconic cephalopod form. The instruction refers to transforming the octopus, implying preservation of its overall structure, so the central head must remain. This is a core recognition element, critical for identity.",
      "question": "Is there a distinct, rounded central head mass from which all arms originate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies that the sculptures’ arrangement should “echo the original ocean scene” with a “harmonious wave pattern.” This means the spatial flow of the arms must replicate the dynamic curvature and interaction with water seen in the original. If the arms are straightened or rigidly placed, the wave-like rhythm is lost, breaking the intended visual continuity. This is a key logical element linking the transformation to the original scene.",
      "question": "Do the arms exhibit a flowing, undulating arrangement that mirrors the wave patterns of the original ocean scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction mentions “textured scales mimicking the original skin,” which implies that the surface detail of the original octopus — including ridges, suction cups, or skin texture — must be preserved in form, even if rendered in ceramic. While the material changes, the texture pattern is a direct reference to the original. Losing this would result in a smoother, less faithful representation, undermining the instruction’s intent.",
      "question": "Are there visible surface textures on the sculptures that mimic the original skin's ridges and suction cup patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The overall silhouette and proportion of the octopus — especially the relative size of the head and arms — contribute to its recognizability. Even if the color and material change, maintaining the general scale and shape ensures visual coherence with the original. The instruction does not permit drastic resizing or distortion, so the proportional relationships must be preserved.",
      "question": "Does the sculpture maintain the same general silhouette and proportional relationship between the head and arms as the original octopus?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
