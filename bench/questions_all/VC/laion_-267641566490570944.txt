Description of reference image: The subject is a panoramic mountain landscape featuring jagged, steep rock formations rising dramatically from a mist-filled valley. The tallest peak is centrally located and sharply pointed, with rugged, dark gray rock surfaces partially covered in green vegetation. Surrounding it are several other spire-like peaks receding into the distance, forming a layered composition that fades into atmospheric haze. The foreground includes low-lying shrubs and branches with green leaves, slightly blurred due to depth of field. The sky above is filled with soft clouds tinged with warm hues of orange, pink, and purple near the horizon, transitioning into cooler blue-gray tones higher up. Sunlight breaks through the clouds on the left side, casting radiant beams across the scene and illuminating parts of the distant mountains in golden light. The overall atmosphere is ethereal, with visible fog or cloud layers between mountain ridges, creating a sense of depth and scale.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions word by word: "Transform the jagged mountain peaks into ancient dragon spirits, with rocky scales and moss-covered spines." This indicates that the form and identity of the mountain peaks are to be changed — they are no longer literal mountains but symbolic dragon figures. The instruction specifies morphing the tallest peak into a dragon’s head, complete with crystal horns and serpentine eyes, meaning its structure must be reimagined as an organic creature rather than geological formation. It also states “extend the ridges as sinuous bodies disappearing into misty clouds,” which implies the ridgelines should become fluid, snake-like forms. However, the instruction does not mention altering the sky, lighting, fog, or vegetation types — only how the peaks themselves are interpreted. Therefore, changes are permitted only to the **shape, texture, and interpretation** of the mountain peaks as dragon-like entities. All non-peak elements such as the sky, sunbeams, mist layers, vegetation textures, and overall atmospheric conditions remain within the allowed scope for preservation unless explicitly altered.

Allowed Changes List:
- Shape and silhouette of the mountain peaks (to resemble dragon heads, bodies, limbs)
- Surface texture of peaks (to include rocky scales, moss-covered spines)
- Interpretation of the tallest peak as a dragon head with crystal horns and serpentine eyes
- Transformation of ridges into sinuous, coiled body segments resembling limbs or tails
- Integration of peak forms into flowing, organic lines extending into clouds

Step 2 - Determine the elements that should remain unchanged  
Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements: While the peaks are being transformed, the original image contains distinct visual features that define its identity as a specific natural landscape — particularly the **position and relative arrangement of the mountain spires**, the **direction and angle of sunlight**, and the **layered atmospheric haze**. These are essential to maintaining the realism and spatial logic of the scene even after transformation. Even though the peaks become dragons, their **spatial relationships** (e.g., tallest peak in center, others fanning out) must be preserved to maintain consistency with the original composition. If these were rearranged arbitrarily, the edited image would lose its connection to the source.

Functional/logical association elements: The **sunlight rays** emanating from the upper-left corner are critical to the mood and lighting dynamics. They interact with the mist and illuminate certain peaks — this interaction must remain intact because it defines the time of day and directional light source. Changing this would disrupt the logical coherence of the environment. Similarly, the **fog layering** between mountain ranges creates depth and perspective; removing or distorting it would break the sense of scale and realism.

Non-modified element deduction: After excluding the allowed changes (i.e., the form and surface detail of the peaks), all remaining elements must be retained. This includes the **sky gradient**, **cloud formations**, **vegetation in foreground**, **texture of rocks on unaltered slopes**, and **overall color palette** (warm sunrise tones). These support the scene's authenticity and provide context for the fantastical transformation. Without them, the fantasy element would feel disconnected from reality.

Preservation Targets List:  
- The direction and origin of sunlight beams from the upper-left quadrant  
- The layered atmospheric haze between mountain ranges  
- The position and relative height of the central tallest peak  
- The presence and distribution of green vegetation on the foreground shrubs and lower slopes  
- The color gradient in the sky (orange-pink near horizon, transitioning to blue-gray above)  
- The texture and appearance of non-transformed rock faces (especially on flanks not designated as dragon parts)  
- The overall depth and spatial layout of the mountain range

Q1:  
Thinking process: The direction and origin of sunlight beams from the upper-left quadrant is a core environmental feature that defines the lighting and mood of the entire scene. It interacts with the mist and highlights specific peaks, creating a sense of time and directionality. Altering this would fundamentally change the visual logic of the image and disconnect the fantasy transformation from the original lighting context. This is a key environmental identifier, making it a 3-point element.  
Question: Is the sunlight originating from the upper-left portion of the sky, casting diagonal rays across the mountain range?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The layered atmospheric haze between mountain ranges is essential for establishing depth and scale. It separates the foreground, midground, and background peaks and contributes to the ethereal quality of the scene. Removing or flattening this layering would collapse the three-dimensional structure of the landscape, undermining the realism necessary for the fantasy transformation to be believable. This is a major compositional element, hence 2 points.  
Question: Are there visible layers of mist or haze separating the mountain ranges at different depths?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The central tallest peak's position and prominence are critical to the composition. It serves as the focal point and anchor for the viewer’s gaze. Even when transformed into a dragon head, its location must remain unchanged to preserve spatial continuity. Moving it would violate the original framing and disorient the viewer. This is a structural core element, so it receives 3 points.  
Question: Is the tallest, most prominent peak located near the center of the image, rising above surrounding spires?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The green vegetation on the foreground shrubs and lower slopes provides ecological grounding and contrast against the rocky terrain. Its presence adds realism and helps distinguish the transformed areas from untouched ones. Removing or changing its color/texture would affect the believability of the scene’s environment. Though not central to identity, it supports visual coherence, thus worth 2 points.  
Question: Are there green leafy plants visible in the foreground, especially on the left side of the frame?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The sky’s color gradient — warm orange and pink near the horizon transitioning into cool blue-gray above — is a defining aesthetic and temporal cue. It signals sunrise or sunset and sets the emotional tone. Any significant alteration to this gradient would change the mood and time of day, breaking the consistency of the original atmosphere. This is a key atmospheric feature, therefore 3 points.  
Question: Does the sky display a gradient from warm orange-pink near the horizon to cooler blue-gray at the top?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The texture and appearance of non-transformed rock faces, particularly on slopes not designated as dragon parts, help maintain material consistency. These areas serve as visual anchors for the real-world geology, providing contrast to the fantastical elements. If these textures were replaced or smoothed, the distinction between natural and magical elements would blur, reducing clarity. This is a detail-level but important coherence element, so 1 point.  
Question: Are there visible rough, dark gray rock surfaces on the mountain sides, especially on the left and right edges of the frame?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
