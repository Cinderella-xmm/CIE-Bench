Description of reference image: The subject is a garden gnome sculpture in a seated posture, facing slightly to the right. It wears a pointed conical hat with a rounded brim, made of a textured material resembling terracotta or weathered stone. The gnome has a prominent, full beard with finely carved vertical lines suggesting hair texture, and a cheerful facial expression with visible eyes, nose, and closed mouth. Its ears are large and rounded, protruding from the sides of the head. The body is stout and compact, dressed in simple clothing that blends into the same earthy tone as the rest of the figure. In its left hand, it holds a woven basket detailed with interlaced strands, which contains two large daisy-like flowers with multiple layered petals and central disc florets. The right hand rests near the basket, partially supporting it. The feet are round and sturdy, resembling boots with visible stitching details. The entire sculpture is uniformly colored in a warm, sandy beige tone with subtle variations in shading to simulate depth and texture, giving it an aged, rustic appearance. The background is plain white, emphasizing the figure without distraction.

Thinking process:  
First, analyze the editing instructions word by word:  
- "Transform the gnome sculpture into a rustic garden product package design" → This indicates a complete reimagining of the object’s function and context, but not necessarily altering the gnome’s core identity.  
- "Reimagine it as a playful seed kit titled 'Garden Gnome Blossoms'" → The name and purpose change, but the gnome remains the central visual anchor.  
- "Replace the basket with a seed packet display" → The basket is explicitly replaced; therefore, the basket's form is no longer required.  
- "Add faux soil and botanical illustrations around the base" → These are new scene elements not present in original, so they can be added freely.  
- "Swap the flowers for plantable seed bombs" → The flowers are directly replaced; thus, their presence is no longer mandatory.  
- "Include detailed texture graphics that resemble earthy materials to enhance the nature essence" → New textures may be added, but only if they do not override original surface features.

From this, we identify:
- **Allowed changes**: Basket (replaced), flowers (replaced), base environment (modified with soil and illustrations), functional interpretation (from ornament to product packaging).
- **Not allowed to change**: The gnome itself—its form, pose, facial features, hat, beard, clothing style, color tone, and overall silhouette—must remain recognizable as the original gnome figure.

Therefore, any modification must preserve the gnome’s identity while allowing transformation of accessories and context.

Allowed Changes List:  
- The woven basket  
- The daisy-like flowers  
- The base area (can include soil, illustrations, seed packets)  
- Functional labeling (e.g., “Garden Gnome Blossoms”)  
- Textural overlays (as long as they don’t obscure core form)

Step 2 - Determine the elements that should remain unchanged  

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements:  
The gnome is a stylized fantasy figure whose identity relies on specific iconic traits:  
- The pointed hat with a wide brim — a hallmark of traditional garden gnomes.  
- The long, textured beard — essential for distinguishing the gnome from other figures.  
- The facial structure: round face, small eyes, broad nose, and smiling mouth.  
- The seated posture with bent knees and forward-facing torso — defines its static pose.  
- The overall proportion: short legs, large head, stout body — typical gnome anatomy.  
These are non-negotiable for identity retention.

Functional/logical association elements:  
- The gnome must still appear seated and holding something in its hands (though what it holds changes).  
- The hand positions must logically support the new object (seed packet), meaning the arms’ orientation and joint angles should remain consistent with the original pose.  
- The gaze direction (slightly upward and to the right) should remain to maintain character expression.

Non-modified element deduction:  
After removing allowed changes (basket, flowers), the remaining parts of the gnome — including the hat, face, beard, body shape, clothing folds, and feet — must stay intact. Even minor details like the ear shape, chin curve, and boot stitching contribute to visual coherence and must be preserved unless explicitly altered.

Preservation Targets List:  
- The pointed conical hat with a wide brim  
- The full, vertically lined beard  
- The facial features: eyes, nose, mouth, and cheeks  
- The seated posture with bent knees and forward-facing upper body  
- The hand positions (left hand raised, right hand resting)  
- The round, stitched boots  
- The overall earthy beige color tone and textured surface finish

    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The pointed conical hat with a wide brim is a defining feature of garden gnomes and serves as a primary identifier. Its shape, size, and placement on the head are crucial for recognition. If removed or significantly altered (e.g., flat cap, different angle), the figure would no longer be identifiable as a gnome. Thus, preserving this hat is essential for maintaining the subject’s core identity.
    Question: Is the pointed conical hat with a wide brim present on the gnome’s head?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The full, textured beard with vertical striations is a key visual trait distinguishing this gnome from others. It covers the lower face and chest, and its intricate carving adds realism and character. Removing or simplifying it would make the figure unrecognizable as a traditional garden gnome. Therefore, the beard’s presence and texture are critical.
    Question: Does the gnome have a full, vertically striated beard extending from the chin down to the chest?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The seated posture with bent knees and forward-leaning torso is integral to the gnome’s pose and balance. This posture defines how the figure interacts with space and supports the hand positions. Altering leg angles or spine curvature would disrupt the original form and suggest a different action or stance, undermining consistency.
    Question: Is the gnome in a seated position with bent knees and a forward-facing upper body?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The facial expression, particularly the small eyes, broad nose, and closed smiling mouth, contributes to the gnome’s cheerful demeanor and distinct personality. These features are essential for emotional recognition and character continuity. Changing them would alter the gnome’s identity and affect viewer perception.
    Question: Does the gnome have small, oval-shaped eyes, a broad nose, and a closed smiling mouth?

    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The round, stitched boots with visible seam lines are a detail that reinforces the gnome’s traditional craftsmanship and attire. While not the most dominant feature, they contribute to the authenticity of the figure. Their absence or replacement with modern footwear would break visual coherence.
    Question: Are the gnome’s feet shaped like round boots with visible stitching details?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The earthy beige tone with subtle textural variation simulates aged stone or terracotta, contributing to the rustic aesthetic. This color scheme is consistent across all parts of the gnome and is essential for maintaining its material identity. A shift to bright colors or smooth finishes would contradict the original appearance.
    Question: Is the gnome uniformly colored in a warm, sandy beige tone with textured surface variations?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The hand positions — left hand raised, right hand resting near the basket — define the figure’s interaction with objects. Although the object being held changes, the hand poses must remain consistent to preserve spatial logic and gesture continuity. Misplacing or flipping hands would create an unnatural posture.
    Question: Is the left hand raised and positioned as if holding an object, while the right hand rests near the lower body?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
