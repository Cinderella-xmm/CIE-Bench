Description of reference image: The subject is an Apple Watch Series 7 or later model, featuring a square-shaped display with rounded corners and a black bezel. The watch case is made of rose gold aluminum, with a prominent digital crown on the right side that has a red accent ring. The band is a soft, light pink (blush) sport band made of silicone, with a smooth texture and a silver-colored circular metal clasp at the buckle end. The screen displays a watch face with a white background, black hour markers in the form of short lines, and three complications: a colorful activity ring at the top center, a music icon in a red circle on the lower left, a date indicator showing "16" with green and yellow progress arcs on the lower right, and a noise level indicator reading "74 dB" in a green arc below the center. The hands of the watch are thin and black, with a red second hand. The overall design is sleek, modern, and minimalist, set against a clean white background.

Thinking process: First, analyze the instructions that clearly state what can be changed:  
- “Transform the smartwatch into a futuristic, cybernetic wrist dragon” → implies the **entire form** of the watch may be reimagined, including shape, material, and function.  
- “Change the watch face into a radiant, holographic dragon eye” → the **display content** is fully replaced; thus, the original watch face layout and icons are no longer required.  
- “Reimagine the band as segmented silver scales” → the **band’s appearance** is to be transformed, so its original color, material, and structure are not preserved.  
- “The digital crown becomes a glowing neural node” → the **digital crown’s form and function** are altered, meaning its original shape and red ring are not retained.  
- “Enhance the screen icons into luminescent control sigils” → the **icons themselves** are to be replaced with new symbolic designs, so their original forms (music note, activity rings, etc.) are not preserved.

Allowed Changes List:  
- The overall shape and structure of the watch (from rectangular to dragon-like form)  
- The color and material of the band (from blush pink silicone to silver segmented scales)  
- The digital crown (from rose gold with red ring to glowing neural node)  
- The watch face display (from analog-style clock with complications to holographic dragon eye)  
- The screen icons (from music, activity, date, noise indicators to luminous control sigils)  
- The background environment (implied to be open for transformation)  

Step 2 – Determine the elements that should remain unchanged  
Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements: While the instruction explicitly transforms the watch into a dragon, certain **iconic structural features** of the Apple Watch must be preserved to maintain identity continuity. These include:  
- The **rectangular display with rounded corners**, which is a defining characteristic of the Apple Watch series and distinguishes it from other smartwatches.  
- The **position and presence of the digital crown** on the right side of the case — even though it will be redesigned, its location and functional role as a primary input mechanism must remain logically consistent.  
- The **band attachment points** and general **wrist-worn configuration** — the device must still be wearable on the wrist, so the connection between case and band must remain intact.  

Functional/logical association elements:  
- The **relationship between the case and the band** must remain functional — the band must attach to the case at two ends, preserving the wearable nature of the device.  
- The **screen's position and orientation** must remain frontal and centered, as it is the primary interface. Even if transformed into a dragon eye, the screen must occupy the same spatial area.  

Non-modified element deduction:  
After excluding all elements explicitly allowed to change (face, band material, crown, icons), the following unmentioned but visually present elements must be retained due to visual coherence and logical necessity:  
- The **overall wrist-worn form factor** — the device must remain wearable on the wrist, so the basic ergonomics and size proportions must be preserved.  
- The **case’s thickness and depth**, as visible in the original image, suggesting a compact, flush design.  
- The **presence of the side button** beneath the digital crown — while not mentioned in the edit, this is a standard feature of Apple Watches and likely remains functional.  

Preservation Targets List:  
- The rectangular display with rounded corners  
- The position of the digital crown on the right side of the case  
- The presence of the side button below the digital crown  
- The wearable wrist configuration (case connected to band at both ends)  
- The front-facing orientation of the screen  

Q1:  
Thinking process: The rectangular display with rounded corners is the core visual identifier of the Apple Watch series. This shape is universally recognized as part of the product’s design language and differentiates it from round or oval smartwatches. If this shape is lost, the device would no longer be identifiable as an Apple Watch, even if reimagined as a dragon. Therefore, it is a key identity-preserving element.  
Question: Is the display of the device rectangular with rounded corners?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The digital crown is a signature feature of Apple Watch, located on the right side of the case. Its placement is critical for user interaction and brand recognition. Although the instruction says it becomes a "glowing neural node," its physical location must remain unchanged to preserve functional logic and visual consistency.  
Question: Is the digital crown positioned on the right side of the watch case?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The side button below the digital crown is a functional component of the Apple Watch, used for system navigation. Though not explicitly mentioned in the editing instruction, it is a standard hardware feature and must remain in place to maintain device functionality and structural integrity. Its absence would compromise the device’s usability and recognizability.  
Question: Is there a small button located below the digital crown on the right side of the case?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The band connects to the case at both ends, forming a closed loop around the wrist. This structural relationship is essential for wearability. Even if the band is transformed into silver scales, the attachment points must remain at the same positions on the case to maintain ergonomic and functional coherence.  
Question: Are the ends of the band attached to the left and right sides of the watch case?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The screen is oriented directly forward, facing outward from the wrist, which is necessary for visibility and interaction. Even when transformed into a holographic dragon eye, the screen must retain its front-facing orientation to serve its purpose. A change in angle would disrupt usability and break the logical continuity of the device.  
Question: Is the screen facing directly forward, perpendicular to the wrist?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The overall thickness and depth of the case are implied by the shadow and curvature in the original image. This compact profile is characteristic of the Apple Watch design. Even in a cybernetic transformation, maintaining similar depth ensures the device remains plausible as a wearable and avoids disproportionate scaling.  
Question: Does the watch case have a slim, compact profile with minimal depth?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The band is made of a flexible, seamless material with a matte finish, and it features multiple adjustment holes along its length. While the material and color will change, the structural presence of these holes indicates adjustability, a functional requirement. Their retention ensures the band remains usable and recognizable as a wrist strap.  
Question: Are there multiple adjustment holes along the length of the band?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
