The provided image shows a double-decker bus labeled with route number 892. There are no indications of a girl, stone platform, or frisbee in this image, nor any grass or sky background. Thus, the editing instructions given do not apply to this specific image content.

However, to adhere to your request, let’s assume we had an image matching your instruction details and proceed with the analysis and question generation.

### Step 1 - Description of Reference Image:
The subject is a young girl holding a frisbee, positioned on a stone platform. The girl is leaning forward, ready to throw the frisbee. She has a casual outfit that consists of summer attire indicating outdoor activity. The original background contains urban elements such as buildings or paved areas. 

### Step 2 - Allowed Changes List:
- Change the background from an urban setting to a wide expanse of grass and blue sky.
- Crop parts of the image to focus solely on the girl, stone platform, and frisbee, removing irrelevant elements.
- Adjust the composition to emphasize the golden ratio for better visual aesthetics.

### Determination of Elements That Should Remain Unchanged:

**Thinking process:**  
- **Core Recognition Elements:** The girl, stone platform, and frisbee are critical for recognizing the activity depicted (throwing a frisbee). If altered, the action and context would lose essential meaning.  
- **Functional/Logical Association Elements:** The girl's posture and the way she holds the frisbee are crucial for conveying the action of throwing. The stone platform supports her position, which should remain consistent for logical coherence.  
- **Visual Coherence Elements:** Retaining the girl's summer outfit and the color of the frisbee ensures that the scene remains coherent and relatable for viewers.

**Preservation Targets List:**
- The girl’s posture and the act of holding the frisbee.
- The stone platform beneath the girl.
- The shape and color of the frisbee.
- The girl’s summer outfit.
