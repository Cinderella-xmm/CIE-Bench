      "thinking_process": "The spiral geometry is the core identity feature of the original image. It is not merely a shape but a precise mathematical curve with consistent angular spacing between each step. If this spiral is flattened, broken, or replaced with a random coil, the image loses its defining characteristic. The transformation into a serpent must retain this spiral form—now interpreted as coiling—but the underlying structure must remain. This is a key element because without the spiral, the image cannot be recognized as derived from the original staircase. Therefore, the question focuses on whether the spiral’s concentric ring structure remains intact.",
      "question": "Does the edited image preserve the concentric spiral structure of the staircase, with steps forming progressively smaller rings as they descend toward the center?",

      "thinking_process": "The parallel rectangular shadows are a critical environmental detail that establishes the lighting condition and time of day. They are cast by a directional light source (likely a skylight) and fall consistently across the steps. Their presence provides depth and realism. If these shadows are removed or replaced with diffuse lighting, the scene’s atmosphere and spatial logic are disrupted. While the instruction allows transformation of materials, it does not specify altering the lighting. Thus, preserving the shadow pattern ensures continuity with the original scene.",

      "thinking_process": "The dark central void is the focal point of the spiral and represents the bottom of the staircase. Its presence creates depth and draws the viewer’s eye inward. Removing or filling it would destroy the sense of verticality and depth. Even if transformed into a serpent’s mouth or internal cavity, the dark space must remain to maintain the illusion of depth. This is a core spatial anchor and must be preserved.",

      "thinking_process": "The handrail’s position along the outer edge of the spiral is a functional and structural element. It follows the curvature of the steps and maintains a consistent distance from the edge. Even if transformed into a spine, its placement must align with the outermost ring of the spiral. Changing its position would break the logical relationship between the railing and the steps. This is a key structural element that must remain consistent.",

      "thinking_process": "The texture of the stone steps—including subtle veining, scratches, and color variations—is a secondary but important detail that adds realism and distinguishes the material from other surfaces. Even if reinterpreted as scales, the original texture should be visible or incorporated. Losing this texture would make the transformation feel artificial or disconnected from the source. It supports visual coherence and material authenticity.",

      "thinking_process": "The direction of light is implied by the angle and orientation of the shadows. The shadows run diagonally across the steps, indicating a light source from above and to one side. This directional lighting creates a sense of time and space. If the shadows are rotated or reversed, the scene’s logic is compromised. Preserving the shadow direction ensures the lighting remains consistent with the original image.",
