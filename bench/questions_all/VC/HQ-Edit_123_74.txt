**Step 1 – Analyze the Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a female snowboarder in mid-descent on a snowy slope, captured in dynamic motion. She wears a bright orange-red ski suit with white diagonal stripes along the legs and torso, paired with black gloves, boots, and a dark blue helmet. Her long brown hair flows behind her, suggesting speed. She is equipped with a black backpack secured by shoulder straps and is riding a black snowboard. The snowboard is angled slightly upward at the front, indicating active carving or turning. The background features a winter mountain landscape with snow-covered pine trees, some heavily laden with snow, and distant jagged peaks under a light snowfall. The lighting is soft and diffused, with a cool blue tone dominating the scene, creating contrast with the warm red of the snowboarder’s outfit. Snowflakes are visible in the air, enhancing the sense of movement and atmosphere.

Thinking process:  
First, analyze the editing instructions word by word to determine what elements can be modified:

- **"Cartoonize the snowboarder"**: This implies stylization—exaggeration of features, simplification of forms, possible loss of realistic proportions.
- **"Enlarging the helmet and hands for dynamism"**: Explicitly allows modification of scale/size of helmet and hands.
- **"Enhance colors with bold, contrasting red and deep blue tones"**: Allows color saturation and contrast adjustment; red and blue will be emphasized but not necessarily altered in identity.
- **"Apply a paper-cut effect to the snow and trees for texture"**: Changes surface texture of environment (snow and trees), so these elements’ appearance can be transformed.
- **"Include interchangeable action presets like different snowboard tricks"**: Implies that the pose/action may change—this allows modification of posture, trick type, or motion state.
- **"Present in a sleek, matte-covered collector's album, focusing on bold typography and winter sports motifs"**: This refers to presentation format, not content—it does not affect the core visual elements of the image itself.

From this analysis, the following elements are explicitly allowed to change:
- Proportions of helmet and hands (enlarged)
- Color intensity and contrast (especially red and blue)
- Texture of snow and trees (paper-cut style)
- Pose and action (interchangeable tricks)
- Overall artistic style (cartoonized)

Allowed Changes List:  
(Specific element 1 that allows for changes): Helmet size (can be enlarged)  
(Specific element 2 that allows for changes): Hand size (can be enlarged)  
(Specific element 3 that allows for changes): Color saturation and contrast (especially red and blue)  
(Specific element 4 that allows for changes): Surface texture of snow and trees (paper-cut effect applied)  
(Specific element 5 that allows for changes): Snowboarder’s posture and trick (interchangeable action presets)  
(Specific element 6 that allows for changes): Artistic style (cartoonization)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

Thinking process:  
Now, exclude the allowed changes and identify what must remain consistent based on core recognition, functional logic, and visual coherence.

**Core recognition elements:**  
The subject is a snowboarder engaged in an action sport. Key identifiers include:
- The presence of a snowboard beneath her feet — essential to define the activity.
- The snowboarder’s attire (ski suit, helmet, gloves, boots) — necessary for identifying her as a winter sports participant.
- The snowboard itself — its shape, position under the feet, and function as a tool for movement must remain logically intact even if stylized.

**Functional/logical association elements:**  
- The snowboard must be connected to her boots and positioned correctly under her feet — otherwise, the action becomes physically impossible.
- The backpack must remain attached to her back via straps — it serves a functional role in gear transport and cannot be removed without altering logic.
- The direction of motion (downslope) and the interaction between board and snow (carving turn) must remain coherent — even if exaggerated, the physics of descent must be implied.

**Non-modified element deduction:**  
After excluding allowed changes:
- The **presence** of the snowboarder’s face, hair, skin tone, and facial expression (though stylized) should remain recognizable.
- The **overall silhouette** of the figure — especially the curved posture indicating motion — must be preserved.
- The **color scheme** of the outfit (orange-red with white stripes) is central to visual identity and should remain identifiable despite enhanced contrast.
- The **background context** — snowy mountains, pine trees, snowfall — must remain present, though texture may change.

Preservation Targets List:  
(The snowboard must be present and positioned under the feet)  
(The snowboarder’s boots must be attached to the snowboard)  
(The backpack must be visible and strapped to the back)  
(The orange-red ski suit with white diagonal stripes must be identifiable)  
(The snowboarder’s face and hair must be present and recognizable)  
(The snowy mountain environment with pine trees must remain in the background)

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

Q1:  
Thinking process: The snowboard is the defining object of the activity — without it, the subject cannot be a snowboarder. Its presence under the feet is essential for logical consistency and identity recognition. Even if cartoonized or stylized, the snowboard must still be clearly depicted as a flat, elongated board beneath the boots. This is a core identity feature, and losing it would make the image unrecognizable as a snowboarding scene. Therefore, it receives a weight of 3 points.  
Question: Is there a snowboard visible beneath the snowboarder’s feet?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3

Q2:  
Thinking process: The boots are functionally linked to the snowboard — they are the interface between the rider and the board. If the boots are missing or disconnected, the action becomes implausible. Their attachment to the snowboard is critical for maintaining logical coherence in the scene. While their shape may be exaggerated, their presence and connection must be retained. This is a key functional element, hence 3 points.  
Question: Are the snowboarder’s boots visibly attached to the snowboard?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3

Q3:  
Thinking process: The backpack is a key accessory indicating preparedness for outdoor winter sports. It is clearly visible in the original image and plays a role in the character’s realism and narrative. Although its size or detail might be adjusted, its presence and attachment via shoulder straps are important for visual coherence and character identity. Removing or distorting it significantly would alter the scene’s authenticity. Thus, it is an important accessory, warranting 2 points.  
Question: Is a backpack visible on the snowboarder’s back with shoulder straps?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2

Q4:  
Thinking process: The orange-red ski suit with white diagonal stripes is a distinctive visual signature of the subject’s attire. This color pattern is prominent and unique within the composition, helping to distinguish her from the background. While colors may be intensified, the basic color scheme and stripe placement must remain identifiable. Changing this entirely would obscure her identity and disrupt visual continuity. It is a core visual identifier, so it receives 3 points.  
Question: Does the snowboarder wear an orange-red ski suit with white diagonal stripes on the legs and torso?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3

Q5:  
Thinking process: The snowboarder’s face and hair are essential for recognizing her as a human subject and conveying emotion and motion. The flowing hair indicates speed, and the facial expression adds personality. Even if stylized, the face must remain present and recognizable. Losing it would make the figure anonymous and reduce emotional impact. This is a core identification feature, thus weighted at 3 points.  
Question: Is the snowboarder’s face visible with long brown hair flowing behind her?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3

Q6:  
Thinking process: The snowy mountain environment with pine trees provides the necessary context for the winter sports setting. While the texture may be changed to a paper-cut style, the presence of snow-covered trees and distant peaks must remain to preserve the scene’s identity. Removing or replacing them would fundamentally alter the setting. This is a key environmental element, so it receives 2 points.  
Question: Are snow-covered pine trees and distant mountains visible in the background?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2

Q7:  
Thinking process: The snowboarder’s posture — leaning forward with bent knees and arms extended — is crucial for conveying motion and balance. Even if exaggerated for dynamism, the general pose must reflect active snowboarding. A static or incorrect stance would break the illusion of movement. This is a key action-related element, so it receives 2 points.  
Question: Is the snowboarder in a forward-leaning, crouched posture indicative of descending motion?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2
