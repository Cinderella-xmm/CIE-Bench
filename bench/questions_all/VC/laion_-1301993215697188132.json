      "thinking_process": "The blue color and herringbone texture of the jacket are core visual identifiers in the original image. The instruction explicitly states to retain \"the blue attire,\" which includes both color and material appearance. If this texture and color are lost, the connection between the original and transformed image breaks, making it impossible to verify fidelity. The blue fabric's pattern is distinctive and not common among other garments, making it a key identity feature. Hence, preserving this specific textile detail is essential.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The structured collar and lapel shape define the formal nature of the attire and contribute to the recognizable silhouette of the original subject. Although the jacket may be adapted into a feathered cloak, the collar’s form and placement must remain consistent to ensure continuity. Altering this would change the garment’s identity and disrupt the visual link to the original image. It is a key structural component tied to the subject’s professional appearance.",
      "question": "Are the collar and lapel shape of the blue jacket preserved in the edited image?",

      "thinking_process": "The presence of two microphones positioned symmetrically in front of the speaker is a functional and contextual element. They indicate a formal speaking event and are directly linked to the theme of public speaking. The instruction does not mention removing them, and since they are part of the original scene, their inclusion helps maintain the scenario’s logic. Even if stylized, their number and orientation must be preserved to reflect the original setup.",
      "question": "Are two microphones visible in front of the speaker in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The raised right hand with an open palm is a key gesture associated with emphasis during speech. The instruction specifies transforming this into \"expressive wing movements,\" implying that while the form changes, the gesture’s purpose and spatial orientation must remain. This action is central to the communication dynamic and must be retained in equivalent form to preserve the narrative of active speaking.",
      "question": "Is the speaker’s right hand raised with an open palm in the edited image?",
      "choices": [

      "thinking_process": "The circular emblem on the podium, with its blue field, gold border, and star pattern, is a distinctive symbol that anchors the scene in an official or governmental context. It is partially visible in the original image and serves as a visual cue for authority. Although not explicitly required to be kept, its absence would remove a key contextual detail. Since no instruction allows its removal, and it contributes to scene authenticity, it must be preserved.",
      "question": "Is the circular emblem with a blue center, gold border, and star pattern visible on the podium in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
