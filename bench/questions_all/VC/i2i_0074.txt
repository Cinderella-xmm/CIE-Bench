Description of reference image: The subject is a neatly arranged bedroom featuring a simple, modern design. The bed, made of light wood, is centered in the room with a neutral-colored comforter and several white pillows. Above the bed hangs a large framed picture depicting a serene sunset over a lake. Flanking the bed are two small wooden nightstands, each topped with a simple pendant lamp. One nightstand also holds a green potted plant and a stack of books. The room has light beige walls, a textured area rug covering the wooden floor, and sheer curtains over the windows.

### Step 1 - Allowed Changes List
Thinking process: The instructions suggest generating a cover for *Ideal Home* with added titles, sections, and a text module. This means we can add overlaid text elements without altering the bedroom setup significantly. Thereâ€™s no mention of changing the room's fundamental layout, furniture, or decor style. However, adjusting light levels, adding subtle filters for mood, or slight color correction might still be permissible.

Allowed Changes List:
- Adding overlaid text elements for the magazine cover (titles, headings, price modules).
- Adjustments in lighting, color balance, and contrast to suit the magazine aesthetic.
  
### Step 2 - Preservation Targets List
Thinking process: Elements such as the bed design, the framed artwork, and the positioning of lamps/natural elements are integral to the room's identity and should be retained. Changing them would alter the original design's essence. Functional placement of the bed and nightstands ensures a realistic bedroom setup.

Preservation Targets List:
- The central placement of the bed with wooden design and neutral bedding.
- The large framed sunset artwork above the bed.
- The placement of pendant lamps and their warm glow.
- The matching wooden nightstands on either side of the bed.
- The inclusion of natural elements like the plant and books.
