      "thinking_process": "The raised torch in the right hand is the most iconic feature of the Statue of Liberty, universally recognized as a symbol of enlightenment and freedom. Its upward orientation is critical to the statue’s identity; if missing or repositioned, the statue would no longer be identifiable. This is a core recognition element, making its retention essential.",
      "question": "Is the torch held high in the statue’s right hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The tablet held in the left hand is a defining attribute, inscribed with the date of American independence. Its presence and position are key to identifying the statue as the Statue of Liberty rather than a generic figure. Altering or removing it would undermine historical accuracy and recognition.",
      "question": "Does the statue hold a tablet in its left hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The seven-pointed crown is a unique architectural feature of the Statue of Liberty, representing the seven continents and seas. Its shape and number of rays are essential for distinguishing it from other statues. Any deviation would compromise its identity.",
      "question": "Does the statue wear a crown with exactly seven sharp points radiating from the top of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The draped robe with layered folds is a signature stylistic element of the statue’s design, contributing to its grandeur and movement. While minor stylization may occur, the general form and flow must be preserved to maintain visual coherence with the original.",
      "question": "Does the statue wear a long, flowing robe with clearly defined vertical and horizontal folds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The verdigris patina is a defining visual trait of the Statue of Liberty, resulting from copper oxidation over time. While the instruction allows copper hues, the dominant greenish tone must remain to preserve authenticity. Losing this would make the statue appear alien or unrecognizable.",
      "question": "Is the statue predominantly colored in a greenish-blue (verdigris) hue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The upright posture with arms extended—one holding the torch, the other the tablet—is central to the statue’s symbolic stance. Changing the pose would alter its meaning and identity. This is a functional and symbolic alignment that must be preserved.",
      "question": "Is the statue standing upright with one arm raised and the other lowered holding an object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
