Description of reference image: The subject is a male tennis player wearing a red athletic shirt with black shorts. He has short, dark hair and is mid-action, holding a tennis racket with both hands positioned to hit a yellow tennis ball. His stance is dynamic, leaning forward, and his gaze is focused toward the ball. The background appears blurred, featuring hints of outdoor greenery and a fence, suggesting an outdoor tennis court setting.

### Step 1 - Allowed Changes List
Thinking process: The editing instructions specify transforming the tennis player's motion into a four-frame action breakdown in clean line art with monochrome filling, removing the background. This means visual styles, artistic mediums, and backgrounds can be altered significantly, but core elements defining the action sequence and the player's identity must persist.

Allowed Changes List:
Specific element 1 that allows for changes: Visual style and medium (conversion to clean line art and monochrome fill)
Specific element 2 that allows for changes: The background (to be removed entirely)

### Step 2 - Preservation Targets List
Thinking process: Core recognition elements include the player's sportswear, pose, and interaction with the racket and ball. Functional elements involve the tennis racket's positioning and the ball's trajectory. Remaining visual details like the player's specific clothing design and posture contribute significantly to continuity and should be preserved.

Preservation Targets List:
(Element 1 that should be maintained: The player's red shirt and black shorts)
(Element 2 that should be maintained: The player's dynamic pose and interaction with the racket and ball)
(Element 3 that should be maintained: The tennis racket's position relative to the ball)
(Element 4 that should be maintained: The player's short dark hair)
(Element 5 that should be maintained: The yellow tennis ball)
