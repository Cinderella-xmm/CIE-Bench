      "thinking_process": "The presence of two distinct back cushions is a core structural feature of the original sofa, clearly visible in the image. These cushions define the dual seating capacity and are essential to identifying the object as a two-seater sofa. Even though the instruction allows transformation into a cloud creature, the number and relative positioning of these cushions must be preserved in the fantasy form to maintain visual coherence and logical continuity. Losing one or both would alter the fundamental structure and make the transformation inconsistent with the original. Therefore, this is a high-weight retention requirement.",

      "thinking_process": "The two armrests are prominent features in the original image, located on either side of the sofa. They are integral to the sofa’s form and symmetry. The instruction does not specify removing them, only transforming their material and form. Therefore, the presence of two armrests must be retained in the edited image, even if they become cloud-like extensions or wind-formed appendages. Their absence would break the bilateral symmetry and disrupt the recognizable structure of the original.",
      "question": "Are there two armrests, one on each side of the sofa, aligned with the seat cushions?",

      "thinking_process": "The four wooden legs are a defining structural element of the sofa, providing support and grounding the piece. Although the instruction says to reimagine the wooden framework as \"branching jets of wind,\" this implies transformation, not elimination. The number of legs (four) and their placement (one at each corner) must be preserved in the fantasy version to maintain the original’s base structure. Removing or altering the number would fundamentally change the object’s footprint and stability logic.",

      "thinking_process": "The symmetry of the sofa—its left-right balance in cushion placement, armrests, and leg positions—is a key visual trait. It contributes to the mid-century modern aesthetic and ensures visual harmony. The instruction does not allow asymmetry, as the transformation into a cloud creature likely depends on balanced forms. Preserving symmetry ensures the fantasy version remains coherent and recognizable as derived from the original.",
      "question": "Is the sofa symmetrically arranged along a vertical centerline, with identical features on the left and right sides?",

      "thinking_process": "The central alignment of the seat cushions relative to the backrest is a critical spatial relationship. In the original, the seat cushions sit directly beneath the backrest cushions, forming a continuous, cohesive seating area. This alignment must be preserved in the fantasy version to maintain the illusion of a single, unified form. If the seat cushions are shifted or disconnected from the backrest, the transformation loses structural integrity.",

While not essential for identification, they are unique visual markers of the original construction. Their retention adds authenticity to the transformation, showing continuity in craftsmanship. Though low weight, their loss would reduce visual fidelity.",
