      "thinking_process": "The central dome is the most iconic feature of the building, defining its architectural identity. Its spherical shape and central placement are critical for recognition. Even if transformed into a cinnamon dome, the **spherical shape and axial position** must be preserved to maintain the building’s core identity. This is a key identifier, so its retention is essential.",
      "question": "Is the central dome present and positioned directly above the main structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The golden star atop the dome is a distinctive symbolic element, serving as a visual landmark. Its presence at the peak of the spire is crucial for identifying the building’s unique silhouette. Even in a candy-themed version, the **presence and location** of the star must be preserved to retain the original’s identity.",
      "question": "Is there a golden star located at the very top of the dome’s spire?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The symmetrical pattern of rectangular windows across the façade defines the building’s formal design. Their number, spacing, and alignment contribute to the structure’s balance and recognizability. Altering this grid would fundamentally change the building’s appearance, so the **window layout** must remain intact.",
      "question": "Are the windows arranged in a symmetrical grid pattern across the building’s front face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The columned portico at the base is a functional and architectural hallmark of neoclassical buildings. Its presence and position at the entrance establish the building’s grandeur and formal entry. Even if made of biscuit, the **existence and alignment of the columns** must be preserved to maintain structural authenticity.",
      "question": "Is there a row of vertical columns forming a portico at the ground level of the building’s front?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The two large trees framing the building on the left and right sides create a balanced composition and anchor the scene. Their **position relative to the building** and **height proportion** are important for visual harmony. While their material may change, their **placement and size relationship** must remain consistent.",
      "question": "Are there two large trees with golden-yellow foliage positioned symmetrically on both sides of the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The road in front of the building provides spatial context and leads the viewer’s eye toward the structure. Its **straight alignment** and **position relative to the building’s base** are essential for maintaining the original perspective and depth. Even if the surface changes, the **road’s linear path and placement** must be preserved.",
      "question": "Is there a straight paved road running in front of the building, parallel to its base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The building’s overall shape—a square base with rounded upper corners leading into the dome—is a defining geometric feature. This **transition from rectilinear to curved form** is unique to the design and must be preserved to avoid misidentification. Even with candy materials, the **outline and volume** must remain unchanged.",
      "question": "Does the building have a square base with rounded corners on the upper levels before transitioning into the dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
