Description of reference image: The subject consists of three individuals positioned in a lush oasis environment with palm trees and a reflective water body in the background. On the left, a character with short blonde hair wears dark metallic armor with glowing orange runes on the chest and arms; their right hand is raised, fingers splayed, as if casting a spell. In the center, a character with curly black hair holds a translucent blue orb emitting soft light, dressed in simple brown adventurer’s clothing with layered fabric and visible folds. On the right, a female archer with long dark hair wears leather armor with metal bracers and knee guards, a quiver of arrows strapped to her back, and a floral crown made of pink and red flowers atop her head. She is crouched in a ready stance, facing forward. The ground is sandy with scattered tufts of grass, and the lighting suggests golden hour, casting warm tones across the scene. The background features tall palm trees with detailed fronds, a calm water surface reflecting the sky and foliage, and a misty atmosphere that enhances depth. A woven basket rests near the feet of the leftmost character.

Thinking process: First, analyze the instructions that clearly state what can be changed:  
- "Convert the individuals into chibi-style 3D models" → This allows transformation of the human figures’ proportions, facial features, and overall form into stylized chibi versions (e.g., large heads, small bodies).  
- "The character with blonde hair should be outfitted in glowing armor engraved with runes" → The armor style and rune details are specified for modification, but the original presence of glowing runes and armor must still align with this instruction.  
- "The character holding the orb should wear plain adventurer's clothing" → Clothing type is allowed to change, but the act of holding the orb remains functional.  
- "The archer should have leather armor complemented by a floral crown" → Armor material and accessory are specified for modification, but the original floral crown must be retained or reinterpreted.  
- "Keep the photorealistic background of a lush oasis with palm trees intact" → Background elements such as palm trees, water, sand, and lighting must remain unchanged in content and appearance.  
- "Enclose the whole scene within a decorative border" → This adds a new element not present in the original, so it is an addition, not a modification of existing content.

Allowed Changes List:  
- Proportions and facial features of all characters (due to chibi-style conversion)  
- Clothing styles of all characters (as per specific outfit instructions)  
- Armor design and glow effects (especially for blonde-haired character)  
- Addition of a decorative border around the entire scene  
- Style of rendering (from realistic to 3D chibi)

Step 2- Determine the elements that should remain unchanged

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements:  
- The **presence and position of the glowing blue orb** held by the central figure is critical. It is a key functional object in the scene, indicating magical or narrative significance. Even though the character’s clothing may change, the orb must remain in the same hand and retain its luminous quality. Its absence would break the scene’s logic.  
- The **floral crown on the archer’s head** is explicitly mentioned in the instruction as a required feature. Since it is part of the original image, its visual identity (pink and red flowers arranged in a circular pattern) must be preserved, even if stylized.  
- The **woven basket near the feet of the blonde-haired character** is a unique detail in the foreground. Though not mentioned in the instruction, it is a distinct object contributing to the scene’s realism and composition. If removed or altered without reason, it disrupts visual coherence.  
- The **palm tree silhouettes and frond patterns** in the background are essential to the “lush oasis” setting. Their shape, density, and placement define the environment. Any significant alteration would violate the instruction to preserve the photorealistic background.  
- The **reflective water surface** showing mirrored images of palm trees and sky is a core environmental feature. Its texture and clarity contribute to the realism and mood of the scene. It must remain visually consistent.  
- The **golden-hour lighting and warm color tone** across the scene create a cohesive atmosphere. While the style may shift to 3D chibi, the ambient lighting direction and warmth must be preserved to maintain the original mood and spatial logic.

Functional/logical association elements:  
- The **hand-holding relationship between the central character and the orb** must be preserved. The orb is not just an object—it is being actively held, suggesting interaction. Changing this would undermine the narrative function of the character.  
- The **spatial positioning of characters relative to each other and the environment** (e.g., archer crouched on the right, blonde character on the left with raised hand, central figure standing between them) must remain consistent. This layout supports the dynamic tension and storytelling of the scene.  
- The **ground texture and vegetation distribution** (sand, sparse grass, shadows) provide grounding for the characters and support the oasis theme. These must remain unaltered to preserve environmental authenticity.

Non modified element deduction:  
After excluding allowed changes (character proportions, clothing, armor style), the remaining visual elements—such as the **basket**, **water reflections**, **palm tree shapes**, **lighting gradient**, and **flower arrangement**—must be retained due to their role in maintaining visual fidelity and narrative context. These are not mentioned as modifiable, and altering them would contradict the instruction to keep the background intact.

Preservation Targets List:  
- The presence and position of the glowing blue orb held by the central character  
- The floral crown composed of pink and red flowers on the archer’s head  
- The woven basket located near the feet of the blonde-haired character  
- The silhouette and frond structure of the palm trees in the background  
- The reflective surface of the water showing mirrored palm trees and sky  
- The golden-hour lighting with warm tones across the scene  
- The spatial arrangement of the three characters in relation to each other and the environment  

Q1:  
Thinking process: The glowing blue orb is a core functional and narrative element in the scene. Its presence in the hands of the central character defines their role and action. The orb’s luminosity and spherical shape are key identifiers. If lost or replaced, the character’s purpose and the scene’s magic system are undermined. This is a 3-point element because it is essential for identity and function.  
Question: Is the glowing blue orb still present and held in the hands of the central character?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The floral crown is a distinctive accessory on the archer’s head, composed of pink and red flowers arranged in a circular pattern. It is both a stylistic and symbolic feature, and the instruction explicitly requires its inclusion. Its removal or replacement would violate the editing directive and alter the character’s identity. This is a 3-point element due to its explicit mention and visual uniqueness.  
Question: Does the archer wear a floral crown made of pink and red flowers on her head?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The woven basket near the feet of the blonde-haired character is a minor but identifiable object in the foreground. It contributes to the scene’s realism and composition. Although not mentioned in the instruction, it is part of the original image and must be preserved unless explicitly removed. Its absence would create a visual gap and reduce consistency. This is a 2-point element due to its importance in grounding the scene.  
Question: Is there a woven basket located near the feet of the character with blonde hair?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The palm trees in the background are defining features of the oasis environment. Their silhouettes, frond patterns, and spacing are essential to the photorealistic setting. The instruction mandates preserving the background, so these trees must remain visually intact. Altering their shape or number would violate the preservation requirement. This is a 3-point element due to its role in establishing the scene’s identity.  
Question: Are the palm trees in the background retaining their original silhouettes and frond structures?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The reflective water surface shows clear mirror images of the palm trees and sky, contributing to the realism and depth of the scene. This reflection is a key environmental detail that must be preserved to maintain the photorealistic quality of the background. Losing this reflection would break the illusion of a natural oasis. This is a 2-point element due to its importance in environmental coherence.  
Question: Does the water surface reflect the palm trees and sky as seen in the original image?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The golden-hour lighting with warm tones across the scene creates a consistent mood and directional shadowing. This lighting affects all elements and must be preserved to maintain the original atmosphere. Changing the color temperature or light direction would alter the emotional tone and visual harmony. This is a 2-point element due to its influence on the entire scene.  
Question: Is the lighting consistent with golden-hour warmth, casting soft shadows and warm highlights across the scene?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The spatial arrangement of the three characters—blonde on the left with raised hand, central figure holding orb, archer crouched on the right—defines the scene’s dynamics. This layout supports the narrative and visual balance. Altering their positions would disrupt the intended composition and interaction. This is a 2-point element due to its role in scene logic.  
Question: Are the three characters positioned in the same relative arrangement as in the original image?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2
