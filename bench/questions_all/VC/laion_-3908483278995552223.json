      "thinking_process": "The three-pronged trident is a core iconographic element of Aquaman, directly tied to his identity as King of Atlantis. Its specific shape — three sharply pointed prongs arranged symmetrically — is unique and non-negotiable for recognition. Any deviation (e.g., fewer prongs, rounded tips) would compromise identity. This is a 3-point element because it is both functionally significant and visually iconic.",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the trident with exactly three sharp, symmetrical prongs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The armor's distinctive interlocking plate design — particularly the repeating triangular and diamond patterns — is a defining feature of Aquaman’s costume in this film. Altering or simplifying this pattern would make the character unrecognizable. It is a core identity marker and must be preserved even when recolored or rendered in 3D.",
      "question": "Are the geometric patterns (triangular and diamond-shaped plates) clearly visible and intact across the chest, arms, and legs of the armor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The long, wavy hair flowing over the shoulders is a key visual identifier of Jason Momoa’s portrayal of Aquaman. While hairstyle might be adjusted slightly in 3D modeling, its length, flow, and placement are essential for maintaining character continuity. Removing or shortening it significantly would break recognition.",
      "question": "Is the hair long, wavy, and flowing over the shoulders, matching the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The full beard is a prominent facial feature that contributes to Aquaman’s appearance in this version. It is part of the character’s distinct look and helps differentiate him from other characters. Even in a stylized 3D model, its presence and shape must be preserved to maintain authenticity.",
      "question": "Is the full beard present and clearly visible on the face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The right-hand grip on the trident is a functional and symbolic gesture. It shows control and readiness, reinforcing Aquaman’s role as a warrior. Changing the hand position or grip could alter the narrative meaning and weaken the character’s presence. Thus, the hand’s position on the trident shaft must remain consistent.",
      "question": "Is the right hand positioned firmly on the shaft of the trident, gripping it in a dominant stance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The overall silhouette — standing tall, facing forward with head turned — is crucial for conveying the character’s heroic posture. While minor adjustments in angle may occur in 3D, the basic orientation and stance must remain intact to preserve the dramatic impact and recognition.",
      "question": "Does the figure maintain an upright, heroic stance with the head turned to the left side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
