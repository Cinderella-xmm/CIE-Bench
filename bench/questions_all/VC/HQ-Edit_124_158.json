      "thinking_process": "The tabby pattern is the core identity feature of the cat, defined by the specific arrangement of dark stripes over a golden-orange base. This pattern is essential for identifying the cat as a domestic tabby and distinguishing it from other breeds or colors. Losing this pattern would fundamentally alter the subject’s identity. Therefore, this is a high-weight element.",
      "question": "Is the cat's fur pattern composed of dark brown or black stripes over a golden-orange base?",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The greenish-blue eye color is a defining facial feature that contributes to the cat’s expression and recognition. In the original image, the eyes are clearly visible and distinct. Altering their color would misrepresent the subject’s appearance and reduce visual fidelity. This is a key facial identifier.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The crossed front paws are a signature part of the cat’s relaxed posture and are central to the image’s composition. This gesture conveys comfort and confidence and is directly tied to the cat’s demeanor. Changing this would disrupt the emotional tone and visual narrative.",
      "question": "Are the cat’s front paws crossed over its chest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The two floral throw pillows are integral to the original scene’s aesthetic and balance. They frame the cat symmetrically and provide visual contrast. Their presence is necessary for maintaining compositional coherence, even if reinterpreted in a new context.",
      "question": "Are there two square throw pillows with red floral patterns on a cream background flanking the cat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The cat’s tail is curled along the left side of the settee, contributing to the overall symmetry and posture. This detail helps anchor the cat’s position and adds to the realism of the pose. Removing or altering it would break the continuity of the original image.",
      "question": "Is the cat’s tail curled along the left side of the settee?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The red velvet upholstery is a dominant feature of the settee and contributes to the luxurious atmosphere. Even if the settee becomes a throne, the material and color must be preserved to maintain visual consistency with the original.",
      "question": "Is the settee upholstered in deep red velvet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The cat’s white muzzle and prominent whiskers are key facial details that enhance expressiveness. These features help distinguish the cat’s face and contribute to its character. Their absence would make the face less recognizable.",
      "question": "Does the cat have a white muzzle and long white whiskers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
