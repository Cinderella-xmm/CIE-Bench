### Description of Reference Image:
The subject is a person dressed in a light blue uniform, including a cap, shirt, and pants, interacting closely with a giraffe. The person is positioned facing the giraffe, extending their hands as if offering something. The giraffe has a distinct pattern of brown patches outlined in cream, with a long neck and ossicones atop its head. The background consists of lush greenery with trees and bushes, enclosed by a black metal fence. The ground is a mix of dirt and sparse grass.

### Thinking Process:
The editing instructions specify transforming the scene into a LEGO minifigure depiction, altering the subject's form and the giraffe's appearance while enclosing them in a glass cube with a gradient background. However, certain core elements must remain consistent for identity and logical association.

#### Allowed Changes List:
- Subject's form transformed into a LEGO minifigure.
- Giraffe's form stylized to match the person's outfit in LEGO form.
- Scene enclosed in a transparent glass cube.
- Background replaced with a gradient transitioning from dark to light.
- Addition of a matte black base with a nameplate and biological details.

### Thinking Process for Determining Elements That Should Remain Unchanged:
**Core Recognition Elements:** The giraffe's distinctive pattern and ossicones, the person's interaction posture, and the relative positioning of the subjects are crucial for maintaining identity and context.  
**Functional/Logical Association Elements:** The interaction between the person and the giraffe (e.g., the person's extended hands toward the giraffe) must be preserved to maintain the scene's logic.  
**Remaining Elements Based on Visual Coherence:** Details like the giraffe's long neck and the person's uniform color should be retained to support visual consistency.

### Preservation Targets List:
- Giraffe's pattern and ossicones.
- Person's interaction posture and extended hands.
- Relative positioning of the person and giraffe.
- Giraffe's long neck.
- Person's uniform color.
