      "thinking_process": "The child sitting beside the path is a key narrative and scale element. Its presence grounds the scene in human reality and provides perspective. Removing or relocating it would disrupt the spatial relationship between the observer and the structure, making the edited image feel disconnected. It is not mentioned in the transformation instructions, so it must be preserved. This is a core contextual element with high weight due to its role in anchoring the scene.",
      "question": "Is the child still seated on the edge of the path near the water container, facing away from the house?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The concrete path is a critical environmental feature that defines access and movement within the scene. It connects the foreground to the house and guides the viewer’s eye. Altering its shape or removing it would destroy the spatial logic of the composition. Since the instruction does not mention modifying the path, it must remain intact. This is a major scene element affecting coherence.",
      "question": "Does the curved concrete path extend from the bottom right corner of the image toward the house without deviation or interruption?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The neighboring house with the corrugated metal roof provides contextual depth and shows that this is part of a settlement. Its rusted red-brown color and angled roof are distinctive and help distinguish it from the main subject. Changing or removing it would isolate the house unnaturally. As it is not referenced in the transformation, it must be preserved. This is an important environmental detail.",
      "question": "Is there a smaller building with a rusted corrugated metal roof visible to the left of the main house?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The banana plant and orange flowering shrub are prominent in the foreground and contribute to the tropical ambiance. They serve as natural framing elements and add color contrast. While the orange blossoms are said to radiate a soft aura, their physical presence must remain. Their shapes and positions are essential for visual balance and ecological authenticity.",
      "question": "Are the large green banana leaves and the cluster of bright orange flowers clearly visible in the foreground, just below the house?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The satellite dish is being transformed into an eye, but its *location*—on the right side of the upper level, attached via a metal arm—is critical for maintaining visual continuity. If moved or repositioned, the transformation would appear arbitrary. The dish’s original position must be preserved even as it becomes an eye. This is a functional and logical anchor point.",
      "question": "Is the satellite dish located on the right side of the upper floor, extending outward from the structure on a black metal pole?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The base of the stilts must remain anchored to the ground to preserve the structural logic of the house. Even if the stilts become legs, their footpoints must align with the original terrain. Displacing them would create a floating or unstable illusion, breaking realism. This is a functional requirement tied to the original design.",
      "question": "Are the lower ends of the stilts firmly planted in the soil along the slope beneath the house?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The sky and distant misty mountains establish the setting and mood. The blue sky with wispy clouds and low-lying fog over the hills are key atmospheric elements. These are not mentioned for alteration, so they must remain unchanged to preserve the environment. Losing them would make the scene feel alien or inconsistent.",
      "question": "Is the background composed of rolling green hills covered in dense forest, fading into mist under a partly cloudy blue sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The orange blossoms are specifically mentioned to glow, but their physical form must remain. Their presence is vital for color harmony and biological realism. Even with added aura, the actual flower clusters must be present and identifiable. This is a minor detail but contributes to visual fidelity.",
      "question": "Are there distinct clusters of bright orange flowers growing near the base of the house, adjacent to the banana plant?",
