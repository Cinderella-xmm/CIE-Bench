      "thinking_process": "The wooden bench is a key functional and compositional element located on the left side of the porch. Its presence anchors the viewer’s eye and provides scale. While its form may be stylized into geometric shapes, its position and role as a seating object must remain unchanged to preserve the scene’s logic. Removing or relocating it would disrupt the spatial narrative. This is a core functional element tied to the original image’s structure.",
      "question": "Is there a bench positioned on the left side of the porch, facing inward toward the cabin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The glass wall with sliding doors is central to the image’s composition, allowing the interior light to spill outward and creating contrast. Its position on the front face of the cabin is essential for the scene’s balance. Even if stylized into angular lines, it must remain in the same location to maintain the relationship between interior and exterior. This is a core structural element.",
      "question": "Is there a large vertical glass panel or sliding door on the front face of the cabin, emitting warm light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The full moon is a defining feature of the night scene and appears in the upper right quadrant. Its position relative to the cabin and hills establishes the composition’s depth and mood. Even if stylized as a radiant circle, its location must remain consistent to preserve the scene’s spatial logic. This is a core environmental identifier.",
      "question": "Is there a bright circular moon located in the upper right portion of the sky, above the distant hills?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The porch structure with supporting wooden columns defines the foreground and frames the view. Its existence is necessary to support the bench and create a covered outdoor space. Even if the wood is rendered in metallic tones, the columnar supports must remain in place to maintain structural integrity. This is a core architectural feature.",
      "question": "Are there vertical wooden support beams forming the porch structure directly in front of the cabin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The interior light source is critical for the emotional tone of the image—creating warmth and contrast against the cool night. Its visibility through the glass wall indicates occupancy and comfort. Even if the light is stylized, its presence must remain to preserve the scene’s atmosphere. This is a key atmospheric element.",
      "question": "Is there visible warm interior lighting emanating from within the cabin through the glass wall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The flowering plants in the foreground, particularly the white blooms on the right, add texture and life to the scene. While they may be transformed into symmetric patterns, their presence in the lower right area helps ground the composition. Their location is important for visual balance.",
      "question": "Are there flowering plants with small white blossoms located in the lower right foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The silhouette of the hills in the background provides depth and context. While stylized, their presence behind the cabin and beneath the moon is essential for establishing the landscape setting. Their relative position must remain unchanged.",
      "question": "Are there dark silhouetted hills or mountains visible in the background, below the moon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
