Description of reference image: The image consists of several scattered calendar pages from different months, including January, April, May, September, and October. Each page has handwritten notes and highlighted dates, such as "Birthday," "Wedding," "No work," "Quiet day," and "Gym." The pages are laid out on a wooden surface, with visible textures and shadows indicating their placement.

Thinking process:  
The instructions specify arranging the calendar pages into a tidy pile while retaining handwritten notes and highlighted dates. The paper and desk textures, along with lighting and shadows, should create a realistic look. Therefore, the arrangement of pages can be altered, but the content and appearance of the pages themselves must remain consistent.

Allowed Changes List:  
Specific element 1 that allows for changes: The arrangement and stacking order of the calendar pages.  
Specific element 2 that allows for changes: The lighting and shadow effects to enhance realism.  

Step 2 - Determine the elements that should remain unchanged  
Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements include the handwritten notes, highlighted dates, and month labels, as they define the purpose and identity of the image. Functional/logical association elements include the legibility and clarity of the text and markings, ensuring the notes remain readable. Remaining elements like the calendar grid structure and date numbers contribute to visual coherence.

Preservation Targets List:  
(Element 1 that should be maintained: Handwritten notes and highlighted dates)  
(Element 2 that should be maintained: Legibility and clarity of text and markings)  
(Element 3 that should be maintained: Calendar grid structure and date numbers)  
(Element 4 that should be maintained: Month labels)
