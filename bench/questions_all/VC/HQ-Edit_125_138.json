      "thinking_process": "The flame-shaped headdress is a core identifier of Balinese ceremonial dancers. Its upward-sweeping form and golden color distinguish it from other headwear. If lost or simplified beyond recognition, the figure would no longer be identifiable as a traditional Balinese dancer. Thus, preserving its shape and position is critical for cultural and visual identification.",
      "question": "Is the dancer wearing a tall, flame-shaped golden headdress with upward-curving elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The face paint—white complexion with darkened eyes and bright red lips—is a defining feature of Balinese dance performers. It is not merely cosmetic but symbolic. Altering or removing it would result in a loss of cultural authenticity and misrepresentation of the subject’s role. This is a core identity element.",
      "question": "Does the dancer have white-painted skin, darkened eyes, and red lips?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The dancer’s pose—arms extended in a graceful arc, one hand near the head, the other forward—is a classic Balinese dance gesture. This posture is essential to convey the narrative and emotion of the performance. Changing it would distort the intended expression and break the cultural context.",
      "question": "Is the dancer in a dynamic pose with one arm raised near the head and the other extended forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The temple’s multi-tiered pagoda structure with stepped roofs and upturned eaves is an iconic architectural feature of Balinese Hindu temples. Even if rendered in line art, its silhouette must remain intact to preserve cultural and geographical identity. Removing or simplifying its form would make it unrecognizable.",
      "question": "Is the temple composed of multiple stacked tiers with curved, upward-pointing roofs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The two large mythical creatures are positioned symmetrically on either side of the path, facing inward. Their placement creates a balanced, ritualistic entrance. Moving or asymmetrizing them would disrupt the composition and symbolic framing of the scene. Their presence is essential for maintaining the sacred space motif.",
      "question": "Are there two large, identical-looking mythical creatures standing symmetrically on either side of the dancer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The smaller seated statues beneath each creature are part of the temple’s guardian ensemble. They contribute to the layered spiritual hierarchy and are common in Balinese temple architecture. Removing them would simplify the scene excessively and reduce cultural depth.",
      "question": "Are there smaller seated statues located on the pedestals beneath each of the large mythical creatures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The dancer’s jewelry—particularly the necklace and bracelets—is consistent with traditional Balinese attire. While minor compared to larger elements, it contributes to authenticity. Omitting it could lead to a perception of incomplete or inaccurate representation.",
      "question": "Does the dancer wear a visible gold necklace and bracelets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
