      "thinking_process": "The crown-like structure on the forehead with three dots above and a central triangle is a unique and identifiable component of the sugar skull design. Its presence defines the cultural and stylistic identity of the makeup. If absent or altered, the image loses its core symbolic meaning and becomes unrecognizable as a calavera-inspired portrait. This is a key identity feature, hence weighted at 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the crown-like forehead design with three dots and a central triangle present on the child's forehead?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The lace-like border surrounding the eyes is a distinctive detail that contributes to the ornamental quality of the sugar skull. It is symmetrically placed and visually separates the eye area from the rest of the face. Removing or altering it would break the integrity of the design and reduce recognizability. This is an important accessory element within the makeup, thus weighted at 2 points.",
      "question": "Are the lace-like borders encircling the eyes clearly visible and symmetrically drawn?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The stitched mouth with jagged teeth and vertical lines extending downward is a signature feature of the sugar skull aesthetic. Its shape and placement are crucial for identifying the makeup style. Altering it would misrepresent the original design. This is a core part of the facial decoration and essential for recognition, so it receives a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the mouth depicted with a stitched, jagged-tooth pattern and vertical lines extending from the nose to the chin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The eyes are central to facial identity and expression. Their shape, position, and gaze direction are essential for maintaining the subject’s identity. Even in a transformed Renaissance style, the eyes must retain their original form and placement to ensure continuity of the individual. This is a core recognition feature, so it is assigned 3 points.",
      "question": "Are the eyes positioned symmetrically and maintain their original almond shape and direct forward gaze?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The symmetry of the makeup across the face is a fundamental aspect of sugar skull artistry. Any asymmetry or distortion would compromise the visual coherence and cultural authenticity. While minor stylistic adjustments might be acceptable, the overall balance must remain intact. This is a key structural element affecting the design’s integrity, so it is weighted at 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the makeup pattern symmetrically aligned across the left and right sides of the face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The nose bridge and nostril shape are anatomical features that define facial identity. They serve as anchor points for the makeup design. Altering them would distort the face and make the subject unrecognizable. These are minor but essential detail elements that support facial consistency, hence weighted at 1 point.",
      "question": "Is the nose bridge clearly defined and retains its original shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The mouth’s natural lip shape beneath the painted teeth is a subtle but important detail. It provides grounding for the painted elements and ensures the makeup appears applied to a real face. Losing this distinction could make the face look artificial or distorted. This is a minor detail but contributes to visual coherence, so it is given 1 point.",
      "question": "Are the natural lip contours visible beneath the painted teeth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
