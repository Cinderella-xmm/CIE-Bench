      "thinking_process": "The central golden skyscraper is the most prominent feature due to its unique curved, tapering shape and golden illumination. Its silhouette is the core identifier of the skyline. If this shape is altered or simplified beyond recognition (e.g., straightened or flattened), the bookmark would no longer represent the original building. Therefore, preserving the curved tapering form is essential for identity retention. This is a key visual element that defines the building’s uniqueness and public recognition in the original image.",

      "thinking_process": "The leftmost skyscraper has a distinctive angular, asymmetrical top that sets it apart from others. This sharp cut-off and tilt are iconic features that define its identity. If this shape is smoothed or symmetrized, the building would lose its recognizability. Since the instruction requires bookmarks \"shaped like the distinct skyscrapers,\" this specific silhouette must be preserved. It is a core structural detail directly tied to the building’s identity.",

      "thinking_process": "The adjacent building to the left of the central tower has a stepped, rectangular form with clearly defined horizontal layers. This stepped design is a key architectural feature that distinguishes it from the surrounding towers. If this stepped pattern is removed or flattened, the building would not be identifiable. As part of the \"distinct skyscrapers\" to be represented, this structural detail must be preserved in the bookmark version.",

      "thinking_process": "The skyscraper on the right side of the skyline features vertical light strips running up its facade. This pattern is a defining visual characteristic that makes it distinguishable from others. Even if the color changes to silver or gold, the presence and alignment of these vertical lines must be preserved to maintain the building’s identity. Since the instruction specifies \"distinct skyscrapers,\" this pattern is a core identifying element.",

      "thinking_process": "The proportion of the buildings—such as the height-to-width ratio and the narrowing of the central tower—contributes to their recognizability. For example, the central tower is significantly taller than it is wide at the base, and it tapers upward. Altering this proportion would distort the building’s identity. While minor scaling adjustments may be acceptable, the fundamental scale relationship must be maintained for accurate representation. This is a secondary but important detail for visual coherence.",

This widening at the base is a key structural feature that contributes to its visual balance and identity. If the base is narrowed or eliminated, the building would appear unstable and unrecognizable. Though less prominent than the curve, this foundational shape is part of the building’s core form and must be retained.",

      "thinking_process": "The original image includes a small red buoy floating in the water, positioned slightly off-center. While this is a minor environmental detail, it adds depth and realism to the scene. However, since the instruction replaces the entire scene with a book and doodles, this element is not required to be preserved. It is not part of the \"distinct skyscrapers\" and is not referenced in the transformation. Thus, it is not a preservation target.",
