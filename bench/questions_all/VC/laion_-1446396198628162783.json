      "thinking_process": "The NASA logo is the primary organizational identifier on the suit. Its presence, shape, and placement on the left shoulder are critical for recognizing the astronaut as part of NASA’s program. Altering or removing it would misrepresent the agency and diminish the authenticity of the suit. This is a core identity element, making it essential to retain.",
      "question": "Is the NASA logo clearly visible on the left shoulder of the space suit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The white suit with red trim is a defining characteristic of NASA’s EMU spacesuit. The color contrast and placement of red bands on the arms and legs are iconic and distinguish this suit from others. Losing this detail would make the suit unidentifiable as a NASA design, affecting both recognition and authenticity.",
      "question": "Are the red trim bands visible on the upper arm and lower leg of the space suit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The backpack unit (PLSS) and the coiled hoses connecting it to the suit are essential functional components. Their presence ensures the suit appears fully equipped and operational. Removing or distorting them would make the suit appear incomplete or non-functional, undermining its credibility as a real space suit.",
      "question": "Is the white backpack unit attached to the back of the suit, with coiled white hoses extending down the sides?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The helmet with a partially raised visor is a distinctive feature of the suit’s design, indicating readiness and visibility. This specific configuration is important for identifying the suit as a modern NASA EMU. Changing it to a fully closed or open visor would alter the intended representation of the astronaut’s state.",
      "question": "Is the helmet’s visor partially raised, revealing part of the astronaut’s face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The astronaut’s posture—standing upright, facing right—is crucial for maintaining spatial consistency in the infographic. This orientation allows for clear presentation of the suit’s side profile and integration into the layout. Altering the stance would disrupt the visual flow and potentially misalign with the infographic’s design.",
      "question": "Is the astronaut standing upright with their body oriented to the right side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The connection of the hoses from the backpack to the suit is a functional detail that must remain intact to preserve the realism of the life support system. Breaking this link would suggest the suit is not properly equipped, which contradicts its purpose in the infographic.",
      "question": "Are the hoses visibly connected from the backpack to the suit at the torso area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The boots and gloves are integral parts of the suit’s structure and contribute to its completeness. While not as iconic as the logo or trim, their presence ensures the suit appears fully assembled and realistic. Omitting them would make the astronaut appear incomplete.",
      "question": "Are the astronaut’s boots and gloves visible and properly attached to the suit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "thinking_process": "The blue tarp on the floor serves as a grounding element and provides visual contrast to the white suit. While not a core identity feature, it helps anchor the astronaut in the scene and may be used as a base layer in the infographic. Removing it without replacement could create visual dissonance.",
      "question": "Is the astronaut standing on a blue tarp covering the floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
