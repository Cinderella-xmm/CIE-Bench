**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a man in profile, facing right, wearing a dark knit beanie and a dark jacket with a visible collar and zipper. He is holding a white earbud near his ear, mimicking the pose of the woman in the large advertisement behind him. The advertisement features a smiling blonde woman in profile, also facing right, with an earbud in her ear and a Coca-Cola bottle partially visible in her hand. The woman’s hair is neatly styled, and she wears a light-colored top. The ad is framed by a worn, torn poster edge, suggesting it's affixed to a wall or glass surface. The background includes a textured wall on the left and a vertical metal frame on the right, indicating an urban setting. The entire image is monochrome, emphasizing contrasts in tone and texture.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction specifies transforming the image into a surreal, monochrome comic strip with a noir detective theme. Key changes include:
- Transforming the man into a **noir detective**, implying a change in clothing, posture, expression, and possibly accessories (e.g., trench coat, fedora).
- Changing the **background** into an eerie urban scene.
- Adding **text elements** like “Coca-Cola Noir” in a vintage font.
- Introducing **thought bubbles** with narrative content.
- Applying a **comic strip aesthetic**, including panel lines, stylized shading, and visual effects typical of comics.

From this, we infer:
- The **man’s form and identity** are allowed to change significantly — he can be reimagined as a detective.
- The **woman in the ad** is not explicitly mentioned for transformation, but since the ad is part of the scene, and the instruction does not state to preserve her, her depiction may be altered or replaced.
- The **Coca-Cola branding** is referenced in the new text ("Coca-Cola Noir"), so the brand must remain recognizable, even if stylized.
- The **earbud** and **pose** of the man imitating the ad are central to the original juxtaposition; however, since the instruction allows transformation into a detective, this imitation may be retained symbolically or altered.
- The **monochrome tone** is preserved as per the instruction (“monochrome comic strip”), so color is not an issue.
- The **urban environment** is to be changed to "eerie urban," meaning the original wall and frame can be modified.

**Allowed Changes List:**
- Man’s clothing, posture, facial expression, and role (transformed into noir detective)
- Background scenery (replaced with eerie urban setting)
- Text elements (addition of “Coca-Cola Noir” in vintage font)
- Addition of thought bubbles and comic-style panels
- Overall composition and style (transformed into comic strip format)
- Woman in ad (can be altered or removed if needed for narrative)
- Poster edges and surface texture (can be stylized or replaced)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
Despite the extensive transformations permitted, certain elements must remain unchanged because they are either:
1. **Core recognition elements** – essential for identifying the original subject or scene.
2. **Functional/logical association elements** – necessary for maintaining coherence between subject and context.
3. **Non-modified elements deduced by exclusion** – not listed for change, thus assumed to be preserved based on visual fidelity.

**Core recognition elements:**
- The **presence of the Coca-Cola bottle** in the advertisement is critical. Even if stylized, the iconic contour and label must remain recognizable. This is a key brand identifier and part of the original juxtaposition.
- The **earbud** held by the man and worn by the woman is central to the visual metaphor of mimicry. Its presence connects the man to the ad, forming a core narrative device.
- The **profile orientation** of both figures (man and woman) is crucial to the composition. The side-facing alignment enables the visual comparison.
- The **white earbud wire** extending from the woman’s ear in the ad must remain visible to maintain continuity with the man’s action.
- The **torn edge of the poster** is a distinctive texture that anchors the image in reality and indicates wear — a detail that contributes to authenticity and should not be lost.

**Functional/logical elements:**
- The **man’s gesture** of placing the earbud near his ear directly references the woman’s use of it. This interaction forms the core of the original image’s narrative. While the man may be reimagined as a detective, the gesture must persist to retain the conceptual link.
- The **spatial relationship** between the man and the ad — the man standing in front of the poster — must be preserved. This positioning enables the visual joke of imitation and is essential to the image’s logic.

**Non-modified element deduction:**
- The **Coca-Cola logo** on the bottle, though potentially stylized, must retain its iconic shape and placement. Without it, the brand identity is lost.
- The **blonde hair** of the woman in the ad is a distinguishing feature. While not central to the brand, it helps identify the figure and contributes to the realism of the ad.
- The **texture of the wall** on the left and the **vertical frame** on the right provide environmental grounding. Though the background may be changed, these structural elements should remain in their relative positions or be replaced with similar architectural features to maintain spatial logic.

**Preservation Targets List:**
- The Coca-Cola bottle with its distinct contour and partial logo
- The white earbud and its wire extending from the woman’s ear
- The profile view of both the man and the woman
- The man’s hand gesture bringing the earbud to his ear
- The torn edge of the poster
- The spatial arrangement of the man in front of the advertisement
- The visible portion of the Coca-Cola logo on the bottle

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The Coca-Cola bottle is a globally recognized product with a unique contour and label design. Its presence is essential for brand identification and the original juxtaposition. Even in a surreal comic strip, the silhouette and partial logo must be preserved to maintain the reference to Coca-Cola. Losing this would destroy the core commercial and thematic anchor of the image, making it unrecognizable in context. Therefore, this is a 3-point element.
    Question: Is the Coca-Cola bottle present in the advertisement with its distinctive curved shape and visible partial logo?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The white earbud and its wire are central to the narrative of mimicry. The man imitates the woman by holding an earbud, which visually links them. If the earbud is absent or replaced, the core concept of imitation collapses. The wire must extend from the woman’s ear to suggest connectivity, which is a key visual cue. This is a functional and symbolic element critical to the image’s meaning, hence a 3-point question.
    Question: Is the white earbud visible in the woman’s ear with the wire extending downward?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The profile view of both figures is fundamental to the composition. The man and woman face the same direction, creating symmetry and enabling direct visual comparison. Altering this orientation would disrupt the intended juxtaposition and weaken the narrative. This is a core compositional element, not just a detail, so it deserves high weight.
    Question: Are both the man and the woman shown in profile, facing to the right?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The man’s hand gesture — bringing the earbud to his ear — is the physical manifestation of the imitation. It is the action that ties the real person to the advertised image. Even if transformed into a detective, this gesture must be preserved to maintain the original narrative logic. Removing or altering it would break the connection between the two figures.
    Question: Is the man’s right hand positioned near his ear, holding the earbud in a manner that mimics the woman’s use?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The torn edge of the poster is a specific texture that grounds the image in reality and suggests urban decay. It differentiates the ad from a clean digital rendering and adds authenticity. While the background may be changed, this detail should remain to preserve the original context and texture. It is a secondary but important detail that affects visual consistency.
    Question: Is the top-right corner of the advertisement visibly torn or peeling, revealing the underlying surface?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The spatial arrangement — the man standing in front of the ad — is essential to the visual narrative. It establishes the relationship between the real world and the advertisement. If the man were moved behind the ad or placed elsewhere, the concept of imitation would be lost. This is a logical and spatial requirement, so it is a 2-point element.
    Question: Is the man positioned in front of the advertisement, partially overlapping it?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The visible portion of the Coca-Cola logo on the bottle is a key identifier. Even if stylized, the script-like font and curvature of the letters must remain recognizable. Losing this would make the brand unidentifiable, undermining the satirical or nostalgic intent of the edit. This is a core brand element, hence high weight.
    Question: Is the word "Coca" or "Coca-Cola" legible on the bottle in the advertisement?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
