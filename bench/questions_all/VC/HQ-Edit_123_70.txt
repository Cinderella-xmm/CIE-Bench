**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a large brown bear standing in a rushing river, captured mid-motion as it holds a silver salmon in its mouth. The bear is positioned diagonally across the frame, facing right, with its body slightly turned toward the viewer. Its fur is thick, wet, and textured with dark brown tones accented by lighter highlights, especially along the back and shoulders. The bear’s posture shows dynamic movement—its front left paw lifted, water splashing around its legs. The salmon is clearly visible, with a shiny blue-green dorsal side, silvery underbelly, and open mouth, still alive and glistening with moisture. Water droplets are suspended in air near the fish, emphasizing motion. The background consists of a dense, misty forest with tall evergreen trees (likely Douglas fir or spruce), their branches extending into the frame from above. Sunlight filters through the canopy, creating soft beams of light that illuminate the scene. The river is clear and turbulent, with white foam forming at the edges of the current. Moss-covered rocks and ferns line the banks, adding to the natural, untouched wilderness atmosphere. The overall color palette is rich in greens, blues, browns, and soft golden light.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instructions describe transforming the original image into a **two-panel educational comic**, which implies significant structural changes to the composition and layout. The original image is to be repurposed as part of an illustrated narrative, not preserved intact.

Key elements from the original image that are **explicitly allowed to change** include:
- The bear's form: It will be reimagined as an "elder forest guide" wearing spectacles and adopting a wise expression—this means facial features, accessories (glasses), and demeanor can be altered.
- The setting: The original forest river scene is replaced by a “vibrant forest classroom” in Panel 1 and a “transformation chart” in Panel 2—so the environment is no longer required to remain realistic or unchanged.
- The salmon’s state: In Panel 2, it transitions into a diagrammatic life cycle chart, meaning its physical form is abstracted.
- Text additions: Speech bubbles, labels, and fact boxes are introduced—these are new elements not present in the original.
- Aspect ratio: Changed to 16:9 for comic format—original aspect ratio is irrelevant now.
- Font style: A modern sans-serif font is specified—this affects text appearance but not the original image content.

However, the instruction does **not** say to discard or alter the core visual identity of the bear or salmon. Instead, it uses them as **symbolic anchors** in a narrative transformation. Therefore, while the bear’s *appearance* changes (e.g., glasses, clothing), its **identity as a bear** must still be recognizable. Similarly, the salmon remains central to the story and must retain its biological identity even when depicted schematically.

Thus, the **allowed changes list** includes:

Allowed Changes List:  
- Bear’s facial expression (can become wise/elderly)  
- Bear’s accessories (addition of spectacles)  
- Bear’s posture and context (standing in a classroom instead of river)  
- Salmon’s representation (transformed into a life cycle diagram)  
- Background environment (replaced with classroom and transformation chart)  
- Addition of speech bubbles, labels, fact boxes, and text  
- Color scheme adjustments (blue hues for water stages, brown-green for forest)  
- Aspect ratio (changed to 16:9)  
- Artistic style shift (from photorealistic to comic-style illustration)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
We now apply exclusion logic to identify what **must be retained** despite the edits.

**Core recognition elements:**  
- The **bear must remain identifiable as a bear**, not a human or mythical creature. Even with glasses and a wise expression, its fundamental shape—large, furry, quadrupedal, with a snout and ears—must be preserved. This ensures continuity of species identity.
- The **salmon must remain recognizable as a salmon**, especially in its initial form before abstraction. Key traits include elongated body, silvery scales, forked tail, and typical fish anatomy. These define it biologically and narratively.
- The **river setting** is implied in both panels: Panel 1 has a “forest classroom,” but the bear is associated with the river; Panel 2 shows the salmon emerging from bubbling water. So while the full river scene is replaced, the **presence of water as origin point** must be visually linked to the salmon’s emergence. Thus, the **visual concept of flowing water** must persist in some form.
- The **connection between bear and salmon** must remain logical: the bear eats the salmon, so this predator-prey relationship must be maintained—even if dramatized.

**Functional/logical association elements:**  
- The **bear holding the salmon** is central to the narrative. Even if transformed into a guide, the act of catching or interacting with the salmon must be preserved in symbolic form. Hence, the **physical interaction between bear and salmon** must remain evident.
- The **salmon’s journey from river to bear** is the theme. The river must be shown as the source, hence **water as origin** must be retained in Panel 2’s depiction.

**Non-modified element deduction:**  
Even though the environment changes, the **texture and realism of the bear’s fur** should be preserved in the stylized version to maintain consistency with the original. Similarly, the **coloration of the salmon** (blue-green back, silver belly) should remain accurate in the first panel before abstraction. These details help ground the comic in reality and support educational credibility.

Preservation Targets List:  
- The bear’s general body shape and proportions (quadrupedal, large head, thick neck, hump-backed silhouette)  
- The salmon’s anatomical structure (streamlined body, fins, tail, eyes)  
- The presence of water as origin point in Panel 2 (bubbling water leading to transformation)  
- The bear-salmon interaction (the bear must be shown consuming or being associated with the salmon)  
- The naturalistic color fidelity of the bear’s fur (brown tones with texture)  
- The salmon’s coloration (blue-green dorsal side, silvery underside)  

These are not changed directly by the instructions, and they anchor the narrative to real-world biology and ecology.

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The bear’s hump-backed silhouette with a prominent shoulder ridge is a key anatomical feature distinguishing it from other animals like wolves or humans. This shape is essential for identifying the animal as a grizzly or brown bear. If this silhouette is altered (e.g., flattened or humanoid), the animal would no longer be recognizable as a bear, undermining the core identity of the subject. Therefore, preserving this specific body shape is critical.
    Question: Is the bear's body shaped with a distinct hump over the shoulders and a broad, muscular back?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The salmon’s forked tail fin is a defining morphological trait of Pacific salmon species. Its presence confirms the fish’s identity and distinguishes it from other fish like trout or tuna. Removing or altering this feature would misrepresent the species and break the biological accuracy required for an educational comic. Hence, it is a core identification element.
    Question: Does the salmon have a clearly defined forked tail fin?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The bear’s wet, textured fur with visible individual strands and darker patches is a signature detail of the original image. This level of detail contributes to the realism and helps distinguish it from stylized or cartoonish depictions. While the comic may simplify textures, the basic fur pattern and coloration (dark brown with lighter highlights) must be retained to maintain visual coherence with the source material.
    Question: Is the bear’s fur rendered with visible texture and layered shading, showing wetness and depth?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The salmon’s silvery underbelly and blue-green dorsal side are characteristic of adult Pacific salmon in freshwater environments. These colors are essential for accurate representation and ecological authenticity. Even in a simplified comic, these hues must be preserved to ensure scientific correctness and visual consistency with the original.
    Question: Is the salmon colored with a blue-green back and a silvery-white belly?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The bear is shown standing in water with splashes around its legs, indicating movement and interaction with the river. This dynamic pose establishes the action of fishing. Even in the comic version, the bear must be shown in proximity to water or engaged in a similar activity to maintain narrative logic. The presence of water splashes or ripples around the bear’s feet confirms this interaction.
    Question: Are there visible water splashes or ripples around the bear’s lower legs?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The bear’s snout and muzzle are key facial features that distinguish it from other mammals. They are necessary for identifying the animal as a bear, especially when viewed from the side. Altering the snout shape (e.g., making it shorter or more human-like) would compromise species recognition, even if glasses are added.
    Question: Does the bear have a long, broad snout with visible nostrils and a rounded muzzle?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The salmon’s position in the bear’s mouth, with its head pointing outward and body angled upward, is a crucial moment of action. This orientation defines the capture event and must be preserved in the comic’s first panel to maintain continuity. Even if stylized, the fish must appear to be held in the bear’s jaws.
    Question: Is the salmon positioned horizontally in the bear’s mouth, with its head protruding forward?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
