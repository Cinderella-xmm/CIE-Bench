### Step 1 - Description of Reference Image and Allowed Changes List:

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is an owl wearing a graduation cap, holding a rolled-up diploma tied with a yellow ribbon. The owl has warm brown feathers with white spots, large yellow eyes, and a black beak. It stands on a stack of three books with varying colors (blue, orange, and red). The background is a gradient of soft cream to pale blue, creating a calm and scholarly atmosphere.

**Thinking process:**  
The instructions specify transforming the scene into a miniature setting with a LEGO minifigure, enclosing it in a glass cube, and adding a nameplate. The owl's color scheme and academic motifs should harmonize with the LEGO figure. Lighting and background gradients are also specified.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
1. Addition of a LEGO minifigure next to the owl.  
2. Enclosure of the entire scene within a transparent glass cube.  
3. Addition of a matte black base with silver accents and a nameplate.  
4. Adjustment of lighting to highlight features.  
5. Modification of the background gradient to soft cream to pale blue.  

### Step 2 - Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged:

**Thinking process:**  
Core recognition elements include the owl's distinctive features (feathers, eyes, beak, and graduation cap), the diploma, and the books. Functional/logical elements involve the owl holding the diploma and standing on the books. Remaining elements like the owl's posture and the book colors contribute to visual coherence.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
1. The owl's brown and white spotted feathers.  
2. The owl's large yellow eyes and black beak.  
3. The graduation cap on the owl's head.  
4. The owl holding the rolled-up diploma.  
5. The stack of three books beneath the owl.
