Description of reference image: The subject is a man sitting in a booth with a cheerful expression, his arms raised in a welcoming gesture. He sits at a circular table filled with an assortment of food items, including multiple plates of burgers, fries, sandwiches, and condiments. The table also has a drink with a straw and some bottles. The booth is red with a rounded design, and the background contains windows with reflections of urban elements and a portion of graffiti artwork.

Thinking process:  
The instructions clearly state transforming the person into a chibi-style figure while retaining the arms-raised pose and the table full of burgers and fries. The scene around the table and its contents are essential and should be kept consistent. The background can be altered since there is no explicit requirement to preserve it. Therefore, the focus will be on preserving the key elements of the subject's pose, table setup, and food presentation.

Allowed Changes List:  
- Transform the person into a chibi-style collectible figure.  
- Alter the background setting.  
- Adjust the colors and style to match a trendy acrylic standee character sheet.  

Thinking process:  
Based on the given instructions, the core recognition elements include the manâ€™s arms-raised pose, the food arrangement on the table (burgers, fries, drinks, and condiments), and the overall circular table setup. Functional/logical elements such as the position of the food on the table and the subject's interaction with the table must be retained to maintain coherence. Remaining visual details like the red booth and table structure support scene continuity.

Preservation Targets List:  
- The subject's arms-raised pose.  
- The arrangement of burgers, fries, and drinks on the table.  
- The circular table with blue surface and metallic edge.  
- The red booth surroundings.  
- The subject's cheerful expression.
