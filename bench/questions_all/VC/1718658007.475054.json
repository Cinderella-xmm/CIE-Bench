      "thinking_process": "The number of tentacles is a definitive biological identifier for an octopus. A deviation from eight would make the creature unrecognizable as such, undermining the core identity of the subject. This is a key visual feature that must be preserved regardless of stylistic changes.",
      "question": "Does the edited image show the octopus with exactly eight tentacles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The presence of two large, forward-facing eyes is essential for identifying the creature as an octopus rather than another cephalopod or fantasy beast. These eyes are also visually prominent in the original image and contribute to the creature’s expressive character. Their removal or alteration would compromise recognition.",
      "question": "Are there two distinct, large eyes visible on the octopus’s head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Suction cups are a defining anatomical feature of octopus tentacles. While they may be stylized in a retro design, their presence along the tentacle undersides is necessary to preserve biological accuracy and distinguish the octopus from similar-looking creatures. Their absence would result in a loss of key detail.",
      "question": "Are suction cups visible along the underside of at least some of the octopus’s tentacles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The octopus’s location on the shoreline is crucial to the scene’s logic and narrative. Even if stylized, it must remain in contact with both water and land to maintain the original context. Moving it entirely into the sea or placing it on a cliff would break the scene’s coherence.",
      "question": "Is the octopus positioned on or adjacent to the beach, with part of its body in the water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The octopus must remain the primary subject in the foreground, facing the viewer, to preserve the original composition’s focus and impact. Changing its orientation or reducing its prominence would distort the image’s intent and weaken the connection to the source.",
      "question": "Is the octopus clearly the largest and most prominent figure in the image, facing directly toward the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The coastal environment—specifically the presence of both water and sand—is foundational to the scene’s setting. While details can be embellished (e.g., added palm trees), the basic components of beach and sea must remain to ensure continuity with the original image. Removing one would fundamentally alter the scene type.",
      "question": "Is there a visible stretch of sandy beach meeting the ocean water in the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
