**Step 1 – Analyze the editing instructions and determine allowed changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a black leather handbag by Michael Kors, positioned centrally against a plain white background. The bag has a structured yet soft silhouette with a pebbled texture visible across its surface. It features two curved top handles attached with gold-tone hardware, including rectangular buckles and rivets. A detachable shoulder strap is partially visible on the side, secured with gold-tone metal clasps. On the front flap, the brand name “MICHAEL KORS” is embossed in uppercase gold letters near the upper right side. Below it, a circular gold-tone MK logo charm hangs from a small loop, prominently displaying the interlocked "MK" initials. The bag includes a zippered side pocket with a gold-tone zipper pull. The overall design emphasizes elegance through clean lines, symmetrical structure, and consistent use of gold hardware as accents.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction explicitly transforms the handbag into an anthropomorphized model in a fashion show setting. This means:
- The **form** of the bag (its physical shape) will be altered to resemble a human figure.
- The **scene** will change entirely: from a neutral studio shot to a luxurious runway environment with photographers and audience.
- The **purpose** of the object shifts from product display to character representation in a narrative context.

However, despite this transformation, certain elements are implied to be preserved or referenced for recognition:
- The **design identity** of the bag must remain recognizable even after anthropomorphism.
- The **brand signature elements** — such as the MK logo and gold hardware — are likely intended to be retained in the new form as part of the character’s accessories.
- The **texture and color scheme** (black leather, gold hardware) should be echoed in the model's attire.

Thus, the **allowed changes** include:
- The **shape and structure** of the bag being reimagined as a human form.
- The **background** being replaced with a fashion runway scene.
- The **posture and positioning** changing from static to dynamic (strutting).
- The **addition of clothing and accessories** beyond the original bag components (e.g., dress, jewelry).

**Allowed Changes List:**
- The overall shape and spatial configuration of the bag (transformed into a human figure)
- The background environment (changed from white studio to fashion runway)
- The presence and position of the bag itself (now represented as a person)
- Addition of clothing (chic black dress echoing leather texture)
- Addition of new accessories (gold jewelry, brooch)
- Text overlay ("Strut the City Streets")
- Aspect ratio adjustment (tall and narrow format)

**Step 2 – Determine the elements that should remain unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
We now identify which visual elements **must not be changed**, based on their role in preserving the **identity** and **authenticity** of the original product.

**Core recognition elements:**  
- The **MK logo charm** is a distinctive branding element unique to Michael Kors bags. Its circular shape, gold tone, and interlocked "MK" initials are essential for brand identification. Even when transformed into a brooch, it must retain these attributes.
- The **"MICHAEL KORS" text** on the bag is another core identifier. While it may be integrated into the model’s outfit or jewelry, its **presence and font style** should be preserved.
- The **color scheme**: Black body with gold hardware is iconic for this line. The **black leather texture** and **gold-tone metal** must be maintained in the dress and accessories to preserve brand consistency.
- The **pebbled leather texture** is a key material trait of the bag. Although the dress may not replicate every detail, the **visual impression of textured leather** must be evident.

**Functional/logical association elements:**  
- The **hardware design** (buckles, zippers, straps) serves both aesthetic and functional purposes. In the anthropomorphic version, they could become part of the jewelry or structural details of the dress, but their **form and placement** should reflect original functionality.
- The **relationship between the bag and its accessories** (e.g., the MK charm hanging from a loop) implies a logical attachment point. In the new form, this relationship might be mirrored in how the brooch is worn.

**Non-modified element deduction:**  
All other unmentioned aspects — such as the **specific curvature of the handles**, **placement of the side zip**, **rivet positions**, **strap attachments** — are part of the original design and contribute to visual coherence. These should be **retained in some form**, even if abstracted into the costume design.

Preservation Targets List:
- The MK logo charm (circular, gold-tone, interlocked "MK")
- The "MICHAEL KORS" embossed text (gold, uppercase, position near upper right)
- The black pebbled leather texture
- The gold-tone hardware (buckles, zippers, clasps)
- The relative spatial arrangement of the hardware and logos

**Step 3 – Generate yes/no questions targeting key identifying visual elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The MK logo charm is a globally recognized symbol of the Michael Kors brand. Its circular shape, gold-tone finish, and interlocked "MK" initials are critical for brand identification. If this element is absent or altered in form, the edited image would lose its connection to the original product, making it unrecognizable as a Michael Kors item. Therefore, this is a core identity element with a weight of 3 points.
    Question: Is the circular gold-tone MK logo charm present and clearly visible on the model’s attire or accessories?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The "MICHAEL KORS" text is a key branding element placed on the bag. Its presence ensures brand recognition and authenticity. Even when transformed into a fashion show context, this text must be preserved in form and position (or adapted in a way that maintains legibility and placement). Losing it would undermine the product’s identity, making it a high-priority retention element with a weight of 3 points.
    Question: Is the "MICHAEL KORS" brand name visible in gold uppercase letters near the upper right area of the model’s attire?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The black pebbled leather texture is a defining material characteristic of this bag. It distinguishes it from smoother or different-textured designs. In the anthropomorphic version, the dress must reflect this texture visually to maintain continuity with the original product. Without it, the transformation loses its grounding in the source object. This is a core visual attribute, thus assigned 3 points.
    Question: Does the model’s dress feature a black pebbled texture resembling the original bag’s surface?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The gold-tone hardware, including buckles, zippers, and clasps, is a recurring design motif that reinforces the luxury aesthetic. These elements are not just decorative but functional in the original bag. In the transformed image, they should appear as jewelry or structural details in gold tone to maintain visual consistency. Their absence would break the thematic link to the original product, so they are important enough to warrant 2 points.
    Question: Are gold-tone hardware elements (such as buckles, zippers, or clasps) visibly incorporated into the model’s accessories or outfit?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The side zip pocket with a gold-tone zipper pull is a specific functional detail that adds to the bag’s identity. While it may not be central to the overall design, its inclusion helps confirm the authenticity of the original object. In the anthropomorphic version, this detail could be translated into a seam or accessory on the dress. Retaining it ensures fidelity to the original design at a detail level, earning it 1 point.
    Question: Is a zippered pocket with a gold-tone pull visible on the side of the model’s dress or outfit?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The position and shape of the handles are key structural features of the bag. Though the handles will be transformed into limbs or part of the posture in the anthropomorphic version, their curvature and attachment points should be reflected in the model’s stance or arm positioning. This maintains the logical flow of the transformation and supports visual coherence. As a secondary structural cue, it receives 1 point.
    Question: Are the curved handle shapes reflected in the model’s arm or posture alignment?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
