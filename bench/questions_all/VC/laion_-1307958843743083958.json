      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "The seated pose of the cheetahs—including the bent hind legs, tucked tail, and upright front paws—is the defining structural feature that gives them their recognizable form. Even when transformed into perfume bottles, maintaining this pose ensures continuity in identity. This posture is a core recognition element because it distinguishes the sculpture from other animal forms or abstract shapes. Loss of this pose would make the transformation unrecognizable as a derivation of the original.",
      "question": "Are the cheetahs in a seated position with bent hind legs, tucked tails, and upright front paws?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The direction of the cheetah heads—turned slightly to the side—is a key facial orientation that contributes to the lifelike expression and balanced symmetry of the pair. This specific head turn is not arbitrary; it creates a dynamic yet composed look. Changing this would disrupt the intended aesthetic and reduce the visual coherence of the design. It is an important scene-related element that supports the overall composition.",
      "question": "Is the head of each cheetah turned slightly to the side, away from the central divider?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The two-tiered base structure—comprising a glossy black upper tier and a bronze-colored stepped lower tier—is a distinctive architectural feature of the original bookends. Its preservation ensures that the transformed object retains its foundational form. Altering the base’s tiered shape or material would fundamentally change the object’s profile and undermine its original design language.",
      "question": "Does each cheetah rest on a two-tiered base with a black upper section and a bronze-colored stepped lower section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The symmetrical placement of the cheetahs—one on the left and one on the right—defines the balanced composition of the piece. This mirrored arrangement is essential to the design’s visual harmony and functional intent (framing the central divider). Any asymmetry would break the intended aesthetic and logical structure of the display.",
      "question": "Are the cheetah figures positioned symmetrically, one on the left and one on the right, equidistant from the center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The presence of three vertical panels between the cheetahs—two narrow outer ones and one wider central one—is a structural component that defines the spatial layout. While their content is to be replaced, their number and alignment are critical to maintaining the original format. Removing or altering the count would violate the core framework of the design.",
      "question": "Are there exactly three vertical panels positioned between the cheetahs, with two narrower ones flanking a wider central one?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The tail of each cheetah curves gently behind the body and rests on the base, forming a distinct arc. This tail position is part of the animal’s anatomical accuracy and contributes to the naturalistic appearance. Preserving this curve maintains the fidelity of the animal's form, even as it transforms into a bottle. It is a minor but identifiable detail that supports overall consistency.",
      "question": "Does the tail of each cheetah curve upward and rest on the base behind the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
