Description of reference image: The subject is a calico cat with a tricolor coat pattern—orange, black, and white—sitting upright on a weathered wooden post. The cat has striking green eyes, a pink nose, and long white whiskers. Its fur is fluffy, especially around the chest and face, with distinct patches of orange and black forming irregular stripes across its body and tail. The cat’s posture is alert and symmetrical, facing forward with ears perked up. The background consists of dense green ivy leaves with visible veins, some clusters of small round beige seed pods or berries, and soft natural lighting that enhances depth and texture. The wooden post is vertically textured, showing grain lines and slight wear, with several ivy leaves clinging to its surface. The overall composition emphasizes the contrast between the softness of the cat's fur and the rigid structure of the wood and foliage.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions word by word. The instruction states: "Transform the cat into a collection of artfully arranged crystal sculptures." This means the **form** of the cat must change from biological fur to crystalline material. However, it specifies **retaining the original calico pattern through brown and black obsidian accents**, which implies the **color distribution and pattern layout** (orange, black, white) must be preserved in the new material form. It also says to "craft the eyes from vibrant green emerald crystals," meaning the **eye color and position** must remain consistent, though material changes. The instruction explicitly states: "Ensure the cat remains seated atop a simple polished wooden block," indicating the **positioning and support structure** (wooden block) must be retained, but now described as “polished” instead of “weathered.” Therefore, the **posture**, **orientation**, and **seated location** of the cat are required to stay unchanged. The background environment (ivy, seed pods) is not mentioned, so it may be altered or removed unless implied by context. However, since no explicit mention of changing the background is made, we assume only the cat and base are modified, and surrounding elements like ivy may be allowed to vary if they do not interfere with the core subjects.

Allowed Changes List:
- The physical form of the cat (biological fur → crystal sculpture)
- Material composition of the cat (fur → quartz, obsidian, emerald)
- Texture and surface finish of the cat (soft fur → crystalline facets)
- Description of the wooden base ("weathered" → "polished")
- Background elements (ivy, seed pods) — not specified for retention, so potentially modifiable
- Lighting and atmospheric effects — not specified, so can be adjusted

Thinking process:
Core recognition elements: The identity of the cat is defined by its **calico pattern** (specific arrangement of orange, black, and white patches), **green eyes**, **upright seated posture**, and **distinct facial features** such as the pink nose and white muzzle. These are essential for identifying the subject as this particular cat. Even when transformed into crystal, the **pattern layout** must remain identical to preserve visual identity. The **position of the eyes** and **shape of the head** are critical because altering them would make the transformation unrecognizable as the same animal.

Functional/logical association elements: The **cat’s seated position on the wooden block** is functionally tied to the scene logic. The instruction specifies that the cat must remain seated atop a wooden block, preserving spatial relationship and balance. Changing the base or removing it would break this functional placement. Additionally, the **relative size and orientation** of the cat relative to the block must be maintained for coherence.

Non-modified element deduction: After excluding allowed changes (material, texture, background), the remaining visual elements that must be retained include:
- The **exact shape and proportions** of the cat’s body (e.g., rounded belly, short legs, curved tail)
- The **facial structure** (ear shape, eye placement, nose shape)
- The **distribution of color patches** (which defines the calico pattern)
- The **presence and position** of the wooden block beneath the cat
- The **overall pose and symmetry** of the seated cat

Preservation Targets List:
- The calico color pattern (orange, black, white) and its specific distribution across the body
- The green eyes and their central positioning on the face
- The upright seated posture with front paws together
- The pink nose and white muzzle area
- The wooden block supporting the cat, including its vertical orientation and rough texture (though polish may alter surface finish)
- The general silhouette and body proportions of the cat

    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The calico pattern is the defining feature of this cat, consisting of distinct orange, black, and white patches in a non-uniform distribution. This pattern is crucial for species and individual identification. If the crystal transformation alters the patch locations or colors (e.g., swapping orange for red), the cat loses its identity. Thus, preserving the exact layout of these colors is essential. The instruction specifies retaining the pattern using obsidian accents, confirming the need to maintain the original distribution.
    Question: Is the calico pattern of orange, black, and white patches preserved in the same spatial arrangement across the cat’s body?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The green eyes are a key identifying trait of this cat. They are centrally located, large, and vivid in the original image. The instruction specifies crafting them from emerald crystals, which implies the color and position must remain unchanged. Altering eye color or moving them would fundamentally change the subject’s appearance and recognition.
    Question: Are the eyes still green and positioned symmetrically in the center of the face?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The cat is seated upright with its front paws together and body balanced on the wooden post. This posture is critical for maintaining the original composition and intent. The instruction requires the cat to remain seated atop the block, so any deviation (e.g., lying down or crouching) would violate the structural logic of the edit. Preserving this pose ensures continuity.
    Question: Is the cat in an upright seated position with both front paws placed directly in front of the body?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The pink nose and white muzzle are distinctive facial features that contribute to the cat’s identity. The instruction does not mention changing these, and since they are part of the original face structure, they must be retained even if rendered in crystal. Losing the pink nose or replacing the white muzzle with another color would misrepresent the subject.
    Question: Is the pink nose present at the center of the face, surrounded by white fur on the muzzle?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The wooden block supports the cat and is explicitly required to remain. Although the instruction describes it as “polished,” the original block has a rough, weathered texture with visible grain. While surface finish may change, the block’s presence, vertical orientation, and position beneath the cat must be preserved. Removing or relocating it would disrupt the scene’s logic.
    Question: Is the cat seated on a vertical wooden block that supports its full weight?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The cat’s tail is curled slightly to the right, with alternating orange and black bands matching the calico pattern. This specific tail shape and coloration are part of the original design. Even in crystal form, the tail’s curvature and banding must be preserved to maintain consistency with the body pattern and overall identity.
    Question: Is the tail curled to the right side and displaying alternating orange and black bands consistent with the body pattern?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The ears are pointed upward and symmetrically placed on the head. Their shape and position are key to the cat’s alert expression. The instruction does not allow modification of head structure, so ear shape and orientation must remain. Changing them would affect the facial expression and recognition.
    Question: Are both ears upright and pointed forward, symmetrically placed on the top of the head?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}
{
    Q8: 
    Thinking process: The cat’s chest is fluffy and white, forming a prominent bib-like area. This detail contributes to the softness and character of the original image. While the material may change to crystal, the volume and position of the white chest fur must be preserved to maintain visual fidelity.
    Question: Is there a large white fluffy area on the chest extending from the neck down to the front paws?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
