      "thinking_process": "The pointed conical hat with a wide brim is a defining feature of garden gnomes and serves as a primary identifier. Its shape, size, and placement on the head are crucial for recognition. If removed or significantly altered (e.g., flat cap, different angle), the figure would no longer be identifiable as a gnome. Thus, preserving this hat is essential for maintaining the subject’s core identity.",
      "question": "Is the pointed conical hat with a wide brim present on the gnome’s head?",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The full, textured beard with vertical striations is a key visual trait distinguishing this gnome from others. It covers the lower face and chest, and its intricate carving adds realism and character. Removing or simplifying it would make the figure unrecognizable as a traditional garden gnome. Therefore, the beard’s presence and texture are critical.",
      "question": "Does the gnome have a full, vertically striated beard extending from the chin down to the chest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The seated posture with bent knees and forward-leaning torso is integral to the gnome’s pose and balance. This posture defines how the figure interacts with space and supports the hand positions. Altering leg angles or spine curvature would disrupt the original form and suggest a different action or stance, undermining consistency.",
      "question": "Is the gnome in a seated position with bent knees and a forward-facing upper body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The facial expression, particularly the small eyes, broad nose, and closed smiling mouth, contributes to the gnome’s cheerful demeanor and distinct personality. These features are essential for emotional recognition and character continuity. Changing them would alter the gnome’s identity and affect viewer perception.",
      "question": "Does the gnome have small, oval-shaped eyes, a broad nose, and a closed smiling mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The round, stitched boots with visible seam lines are a detail that reinforces the gnome’s traditional craftsmanship and attire. While not the most dominant feature, they contribute to the authenticity of the figure. Their absence or replacement with modern footwear would break visual coherence.",
      "question": "Are the gnome’s feet shaped like round boots with visible stitching details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The earthy beige tone with subtle textural variation simulates aged stone or terracotta, contributing to the rustic aesthetic. This color scheme is consistent across all parts of the gnome and is essential for maintaining its material identity. A shift to bright colors or smooth finishes would contradict the original appearance.",
      "question": "Is the gnome uniformly colored in a warm, sandy beige tone with textured surface variations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The hand positions — left hand raised, right hand resting near the basket — define the figure’s interaction with objects. Although the object being held changes, the hand poses must remain consistent to preserve spatial logic and gesture continuity. Misplacing or flipping hands would create an unnatural posture.",
      "question": "Is the left hand raised and positioned as if holding an object, while the right hand rests near the lower body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
