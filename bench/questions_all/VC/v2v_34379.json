This shape is the core identifier for broccoli. If the shape is altered beyond recognition—even when shrunk—it would no longer be identifiable as broccoli. Thus, preserving the structural form is essential for identity retention. The question directly checks whether the characteristic branching pattern remains after scaling.",
      "question": "Are the broccoli florets in both dishes still composed of distinct tree-like branching structures with dark green crowns and lighter green stems?",

      "thinking_process": "Cauliflower is uniquely identified by its dense, white, fractal-like cluster of florets. This texture and shape distinguish it from other vegetables. Shrinking the cauliflower must not distort this form. The question targets the preservation of the clustered, rounded, and textured appearance, which is critical for identification.",
      "question": "Do the cauliflower florets retain their compact, rounded, and textured white clusters regardless of size?",

      "thinking_process": "The color difference between raw and roasted vegetables is central to the image’s narrative. The left dish must remain bright green and white, while the right dish must show golden-brown and charred areas. Altering these colors would misrepresent the cooking state. The question ensures the color integrity of the raw vegetables is maintained.",
      "question": "Are the vegetables in the left dish still bright green (broccoli) and creamy white (cauliflower), without any browning or charring?",

      "thinking_process": "The roasted vegetables must retain their charred and caramelized appearance to convey the cooking process. The presence of darkened edges and golden-brown surfaces is a key visual cue. Losing this would make the right dish indistinguishable from the left. The question checks for the preservation of these cooked textures.",
      "question": "Do the vegetables in the right dish still exhibit golden-brown caramelization and dark charred edges?",

Their rectangular shape, dual handles, and clean white color are consistent across both dishes. Any change in shape or color would disrupt the visual symmetry and realism. The question verifies the dish’s structural integrity.",
      "question": "Are both dishes identical in shape—rectangular with two handles at the top and bottom—and made of white ceramic material?",

Its light brown color and visible horizontal wood grain pattern are consistent and contribute to the overall aesthetic. Altering the texture or color would break the scene’s coherence. The question ensures the background remains authentic.",
