Description of reference image: The subject is a human figure with skin entirely painted in a vivid, uniform blue tone, facing slightly to the right in profile view. The figure has short, neatly pulled-back hair tied into a small bun at the back of the head, revealing a smooth and clean neck line. The facial features are clearly defined—eyes open with visible irises and pupils, a straight nose, and closed lips forming a neutral expression. The figure's right hand is raised, holding a banana that is coated in a reflective gold finish, with a natural curved shape and visible stem at the top. The banana is held between the thumb and fingers, positioned near the face but not touching it. The background is a solid, textured brown surface with a subtle gradient and slight variation in tone, resembling aged parchment or canvas. There are no additional objects or decorations in the scene.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions word by word: "Convert the image into a surrealist-style painting by highlighting abstract shapes and bold contrasts—integrate the gold banana as a levitating geometric form, apply liquefying textures to the blue figure, and create a fantastical background with warped components."  
- "Convert into a surrealist-style painting" implies a stylistic transformation, allowing changes in rendering technique, texture, and composition.
- "Highlighting abstract shapes and bold contrasts" indicates that forms may be stylized, simplified, or exaggerated, but does not specify which elements must be altered or preserved.
- "Integrate the gold banana as a levitating geometric form" explicitly transforms the banana’s physical state (from being held to floating) and its form (from organic to geometric), so the banana’s original shape and position can change.
- "Apply liquefying textures to the blue figure" means the figure’s surface can be distorted, stretched, or fluidized, so the original anatomical structure and skin texture are allowed to be modified.
- "Create a fantastical background with warped components" confirms that the background can be altered significantly, including warping, distortion, or replacement.

Allowed Changes List:
- The form and position of the gold banana (can become geometric and levitating)
- The texture and surface of the blue figure (can be liquefied or distorted)
- The background (can be warped, replaced, or transformed into a fantastical environment)
- The overall rendering style (can shift to surrealism with abstract shapes and bold contrasts)

Step 2- Determine the elements that should remain unchanged

Thinking process:
Core recognition elements: The identity of the image hinges on two iconic visual components—the blue-painted human figure and the gold banana. While the instructions allow transformation of their form and position, they do not remove them entirely. Therefore, their presence must be retained, even if altered. However, certain intrinsic features must remain identifiable:
- The blue coloration of the figure is a core identity feature; changing it would fundamentally alter the subject’s recognition value.
- The golden color and banana shape are essential for identifying the object, even if it becomes geometric or levitating.
- The figure’s human anatomy (e.g., head, eyes, ears, hands) must remain recognizable despite liquefaction, as otherwise the subject loses its human identity.

Functional/logical association elements: The interaction between the figure and the banana is implied by the original pose—holding the banana. Although the instruction allows the banana to levitate, the logical relationship (that the banana was originally held by the figure) must still be preserved in some form to maintain coherence. However, since the banana is now levitating, the hand may no longer need to support it, so the functional grip may be lost—but the hand’s presence and orientation should still suggest prior interaction.

Non modified element deduction: After excluding allowed changes (banana form, figure texture, background), the following must remain:
- The blue color of the figure’s skin (not just any blue, but a consistent, vivid blue tone across the body)
- The gold color of the banana (must retain metallic sheen and yellow-gold hue)
- The basic human form of the figure (head, torso, limbs, facial features)
- The presence of the banana as an object
- The hand’s position relative to the banana (even if not gripping, it should be near or oriented toward it)

Preservation Targets List:
- The blue coloration of the figure’s skin
- The gold color and banana shape of the object
- The human facial features (eyes, nose, mouth, ears)
- The hand’s presence and general positioning
- The overall silhouette and posture of the figure (side profile, head turned slightly forward)

Q1:  
Thinking process: The blue coloration of the figure’s skin is the most defining characteristic of the subject. It is not merely a shade but a full-body application that distinguishes this figure from any ordinary human. If the blue color is removed or replaced with another hue, the figure loses its iconic identity. This is a core recognition feature, and its retention is essential for maintaining the subject’s identity. Therefore, it is assigned a weight of 3 points.  
Question: Is the figure’s skin uniformly colored in a vivid blue tone?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The gold banana is a central symbolic object in the image. Its golden color and banana shape are key identifiers. Even though the instruction allows it to become geometric and levitating, the material (gold) and the original form (banana) must remain recognizable. Losing the gold color or transforming it into a non-banana shape would make it unrecognizable as the same object. Thus, the gold color and banana shape are critical for identification and are assigned a weight of 3 points.  
Question: Is the banana rendered in a metallic gold color with a curved, elongated shape resembling a real banana?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The human facial features—specifically the eyes, nose, mouth, and ears—are essential for identifying the subject as a human figure. Even with liquefying textures applied, these features must remain discernible to preserve the figure’s identity. If the eyes are blurred or the nose distorted beyond recognition, the figure ceases to be human. These are core identity features and thus carry a weight of 3 points.  
Question: Are the facial features (eyes, nose, mouth, ears) clearly visible and anatomically recognizable?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The hand is a key functional element—it originally holds the banana. Even if the banana is now levitating, the hand must still be present and positioned in a way that suggests interaction. Removing the hand or placing it far away would break the logical connection between the figure and the banana. The hand’s presence and orientation are important for maintaining narrative coherence, so it is assigned a weight of 2 points.  
Question: Is the hand visible and positioned near the banana, suggesting a prior or ongoing interaction?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The figure’s posture—side profile with head slightly turned forward—is a distinctive compositional element. It defines the orientation and gaze direction, contributing to the image’s mood and focus. Changing this posture drastically (e.g., front-facing or upside-down) would alter the visual narrative. While the instruction allows surreal transformations, the basic silhouette and orientation must remain to preserve the original framing. This is an important scene element, so it is assigned a weight of 2 points.  
Question: Is the figure shown in a side profile with the head turned slightly forward, facing right?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The background is described as a solid, textured brown surface. While the instruction allows it to be warped or fantastical, the original texture and color scheme provide context and contrast. If the background is completely replaced with unrelated elements (e.g., space or water), it may disrupt the original aesthetic balance. However, since the instruction explicitly permits transformation, only the presence of a background (not its specific content) needs to be retained. But the original brown tone and texture are not required to be preserved. Therefore, this is a minor detail, and the question focuses on whether any background exists at all. This is a detail-level element, so it is assigned a weight of 1 point.  
Question: Is there a background behind the figure, even if it is transformed or warped?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1
