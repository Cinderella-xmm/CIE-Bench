      "thinking_process": "The surfboard’s elongated oval shape with a central stringer is a core identification feature of a standard surfboard. This shape is essential for distinguishing it from other boards or objects. In the original image, the surfboard has a distinct pointed nose and rounded tail, with a visible line (stringer) running down the center. Losing this shape would make the object unrecognizable as a surfboard, undermining the entire theme of the scene. Therefore, this is a key identity element and must be preserved even in a stylized form.",
      "question": "Is the surfboard depicted with an elongated oval shape and a central stringer running along its length?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The wax block being held in the right hand and applied to the board is a functional element that defines the action taking place. The presence of the wax block and its placement on the board’s surface is critical to identifying the activity as surfboard waxing. Without this, the scene loses its narrative coherence. Even in a chibi or 3D form, the wax block must be visibly present and in contact with the board.",
      "question": "Is there a small white wax block being held by the right hand and applied to the surface of the surfboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The right hand’s position—holding the wax block and pressing it onto the board—is a key gesture that conveys the action of waxing. This specific hand pose is necessary to maintain the functional logic of the scene. If the hand were not in contact with the wax or the board, the action would be misrepresented.",
      "question": "Is the right hand positioned so that the fingers are gripping the wax block and making direct contact with the surfboard’s surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The left hand resting flat on the surfboard provides balance and stability during the waxing process. This positioning is a logical extension of the action and helps anchor the figure’s posture. It is a secondary but important detail that contributes to the realism and coherence of the scene. Even in a stylized version, this hand placement should be preserved to maintain the integrity of the pose.",
      "question": "Is the left hand placed flat on the surfboard, parallel to the board’s surface, providing support?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The textured surface of the surfboard, showing granular wax patterns, is a distinctive visual feature that confirms the board has been waxed. This texture is not just decorative—it signifies the functional preparation of the board for use. In the original image, this texture is clearly visible under the warm light. Retaining this texture, even in a simplified form, ensures the board remains identifiable as a waxed surfboard.",
      "question": "Does the surfboard’s surface show a granular, textured pattern consistent with wax application?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The posture of the figure—crouched forward with knees bent and torso leaning over the board—is a key compositional element that reflects engagement in the task. While the figure may be stylized into a chibi form, the overall orientation and body language must remain consistent to preserve the sense of focused activity. This posture is not explicitly stated as changeable, so it should be retained.",
      "question": "Is the figure positioned in a crouched, forward-leaning posture with knees bent and upper body angled over the surfboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
