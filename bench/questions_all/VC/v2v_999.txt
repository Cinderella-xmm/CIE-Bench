### Step 1 - Analyzing Allowed Changes and Determining Reference Image Details

**Description of reference image:**  
The image depicts a vintage-style bathroom featuring a bathtub with a wooden panel exterior, a pedestal sink, a wooden medicine cabinet with a mirror, and a towel rack holding a beige towel. The walls are tiled with a floral pattern, and the floor has a textured appearance. The lighting fixture above the cabinet adds to the room's classic aesthetic.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instructions specify transforming the cabinet and sink into chibi-style Russian nesting dolls while keeping them positioned along the bathtub's edge. The aspect ratio adjustment to 3:2 horizontally is also noted. This means the cabinet and sink's physical forms will change significantly, but their placement relative to the bathtub must remain consistent. The scene's background, including the bathtub, tiles, and other elements, should stay intact unless explicitly stated otherwise.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
1. Cabinet and sink transformed into chibi-style Russian nesting dolls.
2. Quantity of the new elements increased to five.
3. Aspect ratio adjusted to 3:2 horizontally.

### Step 2 - Determining Elements That Should Remain Unchanged

**Thinking process:**  
Core recognition elements include the bathtub's design, the floral tile pattern, and the towel rack's position. Functional/logical associations involve the spatial arrangement of the bathroom fixtures. Remaining elements like the lighting fixture and wall texture contribute to visual coherence.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
1. Bathtub design and position.
2. Floral tile pattern.
3. Towel rack position and towel presence.
4. Lighting fixture and wall texture.
5. Spatial arrangement of bathroom fixtures.
