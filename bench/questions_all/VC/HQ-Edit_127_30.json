      "thinking_process": "The f-holes are the most distinctive and universally recognized feature of a violin. Their shape—two mirrored \"f\"-like curves—is essential to the instrument's identity. Even when transformed into a luxury case, retaining the f-hole shape ensures the object is identifiable as a violin derivative. Losing this feature would make the object unrecognizable as related to a violin, thus undermining the core identity. This is a key identifier, hence a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Are the two symmetrical f-hole shapes present on the body of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The scroll and tuning pegs are critical components of a violin’s headstock and are immediately recognizable. Their presence defines the instrument’s top end. Even if stylized with gold accents, their form and position must be preserved to maintain visual continuity with the original violin. Removing or altering them would break the link to the source object. This is a core structural element, so it receives a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the scroll with four tuning pegs located at the top end of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The overall silhouette of the violin—its rounded upper and lower bouts connected by a narrow waist—is the primary visual cue for identification. Even if the body is now a case, the outline must match the classic violin shape. Altering this would make the object appear unrelated to a violin. This is a core identity feature, thus weighted at 3 points.",
      "question": "Does the object retain the classic violin silhouette with distinct upper and lower bouts and a central waist?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The bridge area is where the strings cross over the body and is positioned centrally between the f-holes. It is a functional and visual anchor point. While the strings themselves may be replaced with script, the space and implied location of the bridge must remain to preserve spatial logic and recognition. This is an important structural detail, hence a weight of 2 points.",
      "question": "Is there a clearly defined bridge area located between the two f-holes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The diagonal orientation of the violin on the support surface is a key compositional choice in the original image. It creates visual dynamism and balance. Although the support surface will change, the diagonal placement must be maintained to preserve the original framing and aesthetic intent. This is an important scene-related element affecting visual coherence, so it receives a weight of 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the object positioned diagonally across the support surface, with the scroll pointing toward the upper right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
