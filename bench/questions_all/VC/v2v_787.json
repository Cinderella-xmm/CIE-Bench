      "thinking_process": "The almond-shaped eyes are a core facial identifier of the subject. Their distinct shape and placement are essential for recognizing the individual. If they are altered in form (e.g., made rounder or larger), the identity of the person becomes unrecognizable. This feature is central to facial recognition and thus carries the highest weight. The instruction requires retention of \"original facial details,\" which includes eye shape.",
      "question": "Are the eyes almond-shaped and positioned symmetrically on the face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The gold hoop earrings are distinctive accessories that contribute to the subject’s identity. They are small but clearly visible and located in both earlobes. Their presence and shape are key to maintaining visual consistency. Removing or changing them would alter the subject’s appearance significantly, especially given their prominence in the original image. The instruction does not allow changes to facial details, which includes jewelry worn on the face.",
      "question": "Are there small gold hoop earrings present in both ears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The hand-in-pocket pose is a functional and compositional element that defines the subject’s stance. The right hand is visibly inserted into the front pocket of the trousers, with fingers slightly curled and visible. This gesture is explicitly required to be retained. Altering it (e.g., removing the hand or placing it elsewhere) would violate the instruction and disrupt the logical continuity of the pose.",
      "question": "Is the right hand placed inside the front pocket of the trousers with fingers visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The natural curl pattern of the hair is a defining characteristic of the subject’s hairstyle. While the overall length and volume may be adjusted in the chibi style, the wave-like texture and flow of the curls are part of the original identity. Preserving this ensures the character remains visually consistent with the source. Although the instruction allows some stylization, the fundamental curl structure should not be lost.",
      "question": "Does the hair have a natural, wavy curl pattern falling over the shoulders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The slight forward tilt of the head is a subtle but important aspect of the subject’s expression and posture. It contributes to the gentle, approachable demeanor captured in the original image. This tilt is part of the \"pose\" mentioned in the instruction and must be preserved to maintain the intended emotional tone and alignment of facial features.",
      "question": "Is the head slightly tilted forward toward the camera?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The presence of the V-neckline and buttoned front on the blouse is a structural detail that identifies the garment type. While the blouse will be redesigned in the OOTD, the instruction to retain the original pose implies that the general cut and closure method should be reflected in the new design. The buttons and neckline are key to the shirt’s identity and must be preserved in form, even if stylized.",
      "question": "Does the blouse have a V-neckline with visible buttons running down the center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The green trousers have a high waist and flat front with visible belt loops and a defined waistband seam. These are structural details that define the pants’ style. While the design may be adapted for the chibi character, the basic silhouette and construction elements must be retained to preserve the original clothing identity. The pocket where the hand rests must also be present.",
      "question": "Do the trousers have a high waist with a visible waistband seam and belt loops?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
