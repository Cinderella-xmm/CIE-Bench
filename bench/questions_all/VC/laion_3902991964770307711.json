      "thinking_process": "The three-armed structure is the defining feature of the candelabra. It consists of one central arm and two symmetrical side arms. This configuration is essential for identifying the object as a traditional candelabra. Even if transformed into a perfume bottle, the preservation of this structure ensures continuity with the original form. Removing or altering the number of arms would fundamentally change the object's identity. Therefore, this is a core identity element with a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain exactly three arms—one central and two lateral—arranged symmetrically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The symmetry of the arms is a key visual characteristic of the original candelabra. The left and right arms mirror each other in length, curvature, and elevation. This balance contributes to the object's aesthetic and structural integrity. Altering this symmetry would disrupt the visual harmony and make the object unrecognizable as derived from the original. Thus, symmetry is a critical attribute requiring retention, assigning it a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Are the left and right arms symmetrically positioned and shaped relative to the central axis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The base is a distinctive feature with a circular, flared shape and a beaded edge. This design is unique to the original object and serves both functional and decorative purposes. Although the material may change, the **form of the base** is not specified for alteration. Retaining its shape ensures visual consistency with the original. This is a secondary but identifiable detail that supports recognition, hence a weight of 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the base circular, flared, and adorned with a beaded or ridged edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The central stem is a tall, tapering column that connects the base to the top arms. Its height and gradual narrowing are key to the object’s silhouette. The instruction does not specify altering its form, only replacing its material. Therefore, the **vertical shaft’s shape and position** must remain. This preserves the structural logic of the object. As a foundational component, it carries a weight of 2 points.",
      "question": "Does the central stem remain a tall, tapering vertical shaft connecting the base to the top arms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The arms extend in smooth, curved arcs from the central stem to the candle holders. Their curvature is consistent and elegant, contributing to the object’s balanced appearance. While the material may change, the **path and shape of the curves** are not mentioned as modifiable. Preserving these curves maintains the original’s fluid motion and proportions. This is a detailed but important aspect of the design, warranting a weight of 1 point.",
      "question": "Do the arms maintain smooth, curved trajectories from the central stem to the top ends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
