      "thinking_process": "The curved silhouette of the grand piano is the core identity feature that distinguishes it from other instruments. Its distinctive shape — especially the rounded right side and elongated left side — is essential for recognition. Even when transformed into a cosmetic item, the overall outline must remain consistent to preserve the conceptual link. Losing this shape would make the object unrecognizable as derived from a piano, making it a key element with a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the curved side profile of the grand piano preserved, maintaining its characteristic gentle arc and elongated form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The four tapered legs with decorative casters are unique structural identifiers of this specific piano model. Their presence, position, and ornamental feet contribute to the instrument’s classical elegance. Removing or altering them would change the object’s identity and undermine the authenticity of the transformation. This is a key structural detail, hence weighted at 3 points.",
      "question": "Are the four tapered legs with decorative casters present and positioned beneath the piano body as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The central alignment of the piano within the corridor is crucial for maintaining the symmetrical composition and depth perception. This spatial relationship is part of the scene’s visual logic. Shifting the piano off-center or rotating it would disrupt the intended elegance and perspective, affecting overall consistency. Therefore, this positional element is important and assigned a weight of 2.",
      "question": "Is the piano positioned directly in the center of the corridor, aligned with the vanishing point created by the columns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The alternating dark and light square tiles on the floor create a distinct visual rhythm and contribute to the reflective quality of the space. This pattern is a defining feature of the environment and supports the sense of depth and luxury. Changing the tile layout or colors would alter the scene’s character. While not the most critical element, it is significant enough to affect coherence, thus assigned a weight of 2.",
      "question": "Is the floor composed of large square tiles arranged in a repeating pattern of alternating dark and light shades?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The evenly spaced white columns lining both sides of the corridor are essential to the architectural identity of the scene. They establish the marble hall environment required by the instruction. Any deviation in spacing, height, or color would compromise the scene’s elegance and symmetry. This is a major environmental feature, so it is assigned a weight of 3.",
      "question": "Are there tall, evenly spaced white columns extending along both sides of the corridor, forming a symmetrical passage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The glossy black finish of the piano’s exterior is a key visual attribute that contributes to its luxurious appearance. Although the instruction allows for a glossy black texture across packaging, the original sheen and reflective quality must be maintained to preserve the high-end aesthetic. Loss of this texture would reduce the perceived exclusivity. This is a surface-level but important detail, assigned a weight of 2.",
      "question": "Does the piano retain a highly reflective, glossy black surface that mirrors the surrounding environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The soft overhead lighting creates subtle shadows and highlights, particularly under the piano and on the floor. This lighting setup contributes to the mood and realism of the scene. While the intensity might be adjusted, the direction and resulting shadow pattern must remain consistent to preserve depth and spatial accuracy. This is a minor but coherent detail, assigned a weight of 1.",
      "question": "Are soft shadows cast beneath the piano and along the floor, consistent with overhead lighting from above?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
