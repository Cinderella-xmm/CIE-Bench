Description of reference image: The subject is a detailed wooden model of a Viking longship, positioned diagonally on a polished wooden base. The ship features a prominent dragon-head prow with intricate carvings and open jaws, facing rightward. The stern also has a stylized dragon head, mirroring the bow in design. The hull is constructed from layered wooden planks with visible grain, forming a narrow, symmetrical keel typical of Norse vessels. Along the gunwale, a series of oars extend outward, each attached to a small figure representing a rower, and beneath them are circular shields mounted along the side—each shield displays a unique symbol (e.g., cross, star, animal motifs). A single square sail made of coarse beige fabric is hoisted on a central mast, featuring a large circular knotwork emblem in dark red and black at its center, resembling Norse or Celtic interlace patterns. At the top of the mast, a small blue-and-white flag flutters. The model rests on a dark-stained wooden display stand with beveled edges, placed on a rustic wooden table composed of wide planks with visible knots and grain. In the background, three lit candles in dark candlesticks provide warm ambient lighting, casting soft shadows across the scene. The overall atmosphere is dim and atmospheric, emphasizing the craftsmanship and historical aesthetic of the model.

Thinking process:  
First, analyze the editing instructions word by word:  
- "Transform the Viking ship model into a historical-themed board game packaging" → This indicates that the **form** of the subject will change from a physical model to a **box cover artwork**, meaning the **object type** changes.  
- "Style the ship in game artwork on the box cover" → The **visual representation** of the ship becomes stylized, but it must still depict the same ship.  
- "Integrating Norse motifs" → These are allowed to be included or enhanced, but not necessarily new; they may already exist in the original.  
- "Add bold typography for the title 'Voyage of the Vikings'" → New text element, not present originally.  
- "Use the sail design for a game board layout" → The **sail’s pattern** (the knotwork emblem) is repurposed as a game board motif, so the **design of the emblem** must be preserved.  
- "Create mini figures modeled after the rowers" → The **rower figures** are referenced for new figures, so their **presence and form** are relevant.  
- "Add wooden texture accents on the box sides for authenticity" → Adds new textures, not part of original.

From this, we deduce:
- The **subject's core identity** (Viking longship) must remain recognizable.
- The **iconic elements** (dragon heads, shields, sail emblem) must be preserved visually even if stylized.
- The **scene** (candles, table, etc.) is not required to be retained — it can be replaced by a box design.
- The **texture and material** of the ship (wooden planks, carved details) are key to authenticity and should be preserved in artistic rendering.
- The **shield symbols** and **rower figures** are functional components of the ship’s identity and must be retained in concept.
- The **knotwork emblem** on the sail is explicitly reused in the game board, so it must be preserved exactly.

Allowed Changes List:  
- The overall form of the object (from model to box cover artwork)  
- Background environment (candles, table, lighting)  
- Addition of typography ("Voyage of the Vikings")  
- Use of sail design as game board layout  
- Creation of new mini figures based on rowers  
- Addition of wooden texture accents on box sides  

Step 2 - Determine the elements that should remain unchanged  
Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements:  
- The **dragon-headed prow and stern** are iconic identifiers of Viking longships and essential for recognition. Their shape and position define the vessel’s cultural identity.  
- The **knotwork emblem on the sail** is a unique decorative feature that distinguishes this specific model and is directly referenced in the game board design. It must be preserved.  
- The **arrangement of shields along the hull** is a signature trait of Viking ships and contributes to visual identity.  
- The **rower figures and oars** represent the ship’s function and are referenced for game miniatures, so their presence and placement must be retained.  
- The **layered wooden hull structure** reflects authentic construction and is crucial for maintaining historical accuracy in the artwork.

Functional/logical association elements:  
- The **position of the shields relative to the oars and rowers** maintains the logical structure of the ship’s defensive layout. Changing this would misrepresent the vessel’s design.  
- The **mast and sail configuration** (single square sail, central mast) defines the ship’s sailing profile and must be preserved for accuracy.

Non-modified element deduction:  
After excluding allowed changes (background, typography, box format), the remaining **structural and decorative features** of the ship itself must be preserved. These include the **carved dragon heads**, **shields**, **oars**, **hull planking**, and **sail emblem**, as they are not mentioned as changeable and are central to the ship’s identity.

Preservation Targets List:  
- Dragon-headed prow and stern with carved details  
- Circular knotwork emblem on the sail  
- Shield array along the gunwale with distinct symbols  
- Rower figures and oars extending from the hull  
- Layered wooden planking of the hull  
- Central mast and square sail structure

    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The dragon-headed prow is a defining iconographic feature of Viking longships, serving as a primary identifier. Its presence, shape, and ornate carving distinguish it from other ship types. If removed or altered beyond recognition, the vessel would no longer be identifiable as a Viking ship, making it a core identity element. Thus, its retention is critical.
    Question: Is the dragon-headed prow with detailed carvings and open jaws present at the front of the ship?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The circular knotwork emblem on the sail is a unique decorative element that appears prominently in the original model and is explicitly referenced in the instruction to be used as a game board layout. This means its visual design must be preserved exactly. Losing this pattern would break the continuity between the original model and the game design, undermining the transformation logic.
    Question: Is the dark red and black circular knotwork emblem centered on the beige sail?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The shields along the gunwale are not only decorative but historically significant, representing Viking ship defenses. Each shield has a unique symbol, contributing to the model’s individuality. Since the instruction references creating mini figures modeled after rowers, the presence and arrangement of these shields are necessary for accurate representation. Altering them would distort the ship’s appearance.
    Question: Are multiple circular shields with distinct symbols mounted along the side of the ship beneath the oars?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2

{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The rower figures and oars are functional elements that define the ship’s operation and are directly referenced for use in game miniatures. Their number, positioning, and attachment to the hull are critical for maintaining the ship’s operational logic. Removing or changing them would misrepresent the vessel’s design.
    Question: Are there multiple oars extending outward from the hull, each connected to a small human-like figure representing a rower?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The layered wooden planking of the hull is a structural and aesthetic hallmark of Viking shipbuilding. It provides authenticity and visual texture that distinguishes it from other vessels. Since the instruction emphasizes historical authenticity and wooden texture accents, the original wood grain and plank layering must be preserved in the artwork.
    Question: Does the hull consist of clearly defined horizontal wooden planks with visible grain and layered construction?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The central mast and square sail configuration are essential to the ship’s silhouette and functionality. The sail is not just a surface but a key component of the vessel’s design, especially since it is repurposed as a game board. Its shape, size, and attachment point must remain consistent to maintain structural coherence.
    Question: Is there a single central mast supporting a square-shaped sail that is fully unfurled and attached via ropes?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
