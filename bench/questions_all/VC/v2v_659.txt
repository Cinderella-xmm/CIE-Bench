Description of reference image: The subject is a young girl with long, wavy brown hair styled in soft curls that frame her face and fall over her shoulders. She wears a detailed, ornate silver tiara adorned with sparkling gemstones and intricate filigree patterns, positioned centrally on her head. Her facial features include large, expressive brown eyes, a small nose, and a gentle smile with slightly parted lips showing a hint of pinkish-red lipstick. She is dressed in a cream-colored lace dress with long sleeves; the lace has a delicate floral pattern and a scalloped neckline. The texture of the lace is visible, with fine embroidery and semi-transparent fabric. The background is a solid, warm brown tone with subtle gradient shading, providing a neutral backdrop that emphasizes the subject. The lighting is soft and directional, highlighting the contours of her face and the reflective surfaces of the tiara.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions to determine what can be changed. The instructions explicitly state that the person should be transformed into a whimsical 3D chibi-style mascot, meaning the form, proportions, and style of the subject are allowed to change significantly. The hairstyle, clothing, and accessories (such as the crown) may be reimagined in a stylized manner. The scene is to be replaced with an elegant kitchen setting, so the original background is not required to be preserved. The oatmeal blend and packaging are new elements introduced by the instruction and do not exist in the original image. However, the instruction does not mention altering or removing any specific visual identity features of the original subject—such as facial structure, eye color, or the presence of the tiara—except through transformation into a chibi character. Therefore, while the overall appearance will change, certain core identifying traits must still be traceable in the edited version to maintain consistency with the original subject’s identity.

Allowed Changes List:
- The form and proportions of the subject (transformed into a chibi-style 3D character)
- Hairstyle (reimagined in a stylized way)
- Clothing (replaced with royal-themed attire including a miniature crown)
- Background (replaced with an elegant kitchen setting)
- Lighting and atmosphere (adjusted to match the new environment)
- Addition of new objects: oatmeal bowl, cereal box, ingredients
- Artistic rendering style (C4D 3D model with whimsical design)

Step 2 - Determine the elements that should remain unchanged

Thinking process:
Core recognition elements: The original subject is a young girl with distinct facial features—specifically, her large brown eyes, the shape of her face, and the presence of the tiara. These are key identifiers for recognizing her as the same individual. Even though she is being transformed into a chibi character, the core identity must be preserved through recognizable facial traits such as eye shape, skin tone, and the general structure of the face. The tiara is also a central symbolic element tied to her regal aura and must be retained in some form, even if miniaturized or stylized.

Functional/logical association elements: There is no functional interaction between the subject and the background in the original image, so no logical spatial relationships need to be preserved. However, the tiara's placement on the head is functionally linked to its role as a crown, which must remain consistent in terms of positioning relative to the head, even if scaled down.

Non modified element deduction: After excluding all elements listed as allowed to change (e.g., hairstyle, clothing, background), the remaining unmentioned but visually present features—such as the shape of the eyes, the color of the skin, the structure of the ears, and the texture of the lace dress—are not explicitly permitted to change. While the dress may be replaced, the original lace pattern and texture serve as a unique detail that could help anchor the identity of the subject. However, since the instruction allows for a complete redesign of attire, this detail is not strictly required unless it is referenced in the transformation. Thus, only those features directly tied to identity and symbolism are retained.

Preservation Targets List:
- The shape and position of the eyes (large, round, brown)
- The facial structure (soft oval face, small nose, gentle smile)
- The presence and placement of the tiara on the head
- The skin tone and complexion (light, fair with natural blush)
- The general proportion and expression of the face (calm, poised, slightly smiling)

Q1:  
Thinking process: The large, round brown eyes are the most prominent facial feature of the subject and serve as a core identifier. Their shape, size, and color are essential for recognizing the individual. In the chibi transformation, these eyes must remain clearly defined and retain their original characteristics to preserve identity. Losing them would make the character unrecognizable, making this a high-weight element.  
Question: Are the large, round brown eyes present and positioned symmetrically in the center of the face?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The tiara is a symbolic element that defines the subject’s regal theme and is explicitly mentioned in the instruction as being transformed into a "miniature crown version." Its presence on the head is critical to maintaining the royal motif. Even if stylized, the tiara must remain identifiable as a crown-like object placed on top of the head. Removing or replacing it entirely would break the thematic continuity.  
Question: Is there a crown-like accessory present on the top of the head, resembling the original tiara in form and placement?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The facial structure—specifically the soft oval shape of the face, small nose, and gentle smile—is crucial for maintaining the subject’s identity. These features distinguish her from other characters and are not mentioned as changeable. In the chibi style, the proportions may be exaggerated, but the underlying facial structure must remain recognizable. Altering these would compromise identity recognition.  
Question: Does the face retain a soft oval shape with a small nose and a slight upward curve of the lips forming a gentle smile?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The skin tone and natural blush are distinctive visual traits that contribute to the subject’s appearance. While lighting may change in the new scene, the base skin color and subtle rosy cheeks should remain consistent to preserve realism and identity. A significant shift in skin tone would alter the subject’s likeness.  
Question: Is the skin tone light and fair with a natural pinkish blush visible on the cheeks?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The ears are a minor but identifiable anatomical feature. They are visible in the original image and should remain present in the chibi version to maintain anatomical coherence. While not a primary identifier, their absence or distortion could affect the believability of the character.  
Question: Are both ears visible and positioned naturally on the sides of the head?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The hair color and wave pattern are part of the subject’s appearance, though the instruction allows for stylistic changes. However, the original brown wavy hair is a defining trait. In the chibi version, the hair should still be brown and exhibit a wavy texture, even if simplified. Changing the color or texture entirely would deviate from the original identity.  
Question: Is the hair brown in color and styled in soft waves framing the face?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2
