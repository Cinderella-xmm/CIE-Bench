      "thinking_process": "The U.S. national insignia (white star in blue circle with red and white bars) is the primary identifier of the aircraft’s nationality and military affiliation. It is a key visual feature that distinguishes this aircraft from others and is crucial for historical and symbolic recognition. Its absence or alteration would fundamentally misrepresent the aircraft’s identity. This element is located on both wings and the fuselage, and its specific color scheme and geometry must be preserved.",
      "question": "Is the U.S. national insignia (white star within a blue circle, flanked by red and white bars) present on the wings and fuselage of the aircraft?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The twin-engine configuration is a defining structural characteristic of this aircraft type. Each engine is mounted under the wing and has a distinct radial shape. The presence of two engines is essential to identifying the aircraft as a twin-engine bomber. Removing or altering the number or placement of engines would make the aircraft unrecognizable.",
      "question": "Are there two radial engines mounted beneath the wings of the aircraft, one on each side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The three-bladed propellers are a functional and visual hallmark of this aircraft’s propulsion system. They are attached to the front of each engine and are visibly rotating in the original image. Their presence and blade count are critical to the aircraft’s operational appearance. Stylizing them as tiny spinning models in the display case must still preserve the three-blade configuration.",
      "question": "Does each engine have a three-bladed propeller attached to its front?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The cockpit canopy is a distinctive rounded transparent structure located at the top front of the fuselage. It houses the pilot and provides visibility. Its shape and position are unique to this aircraft model. Altering its form or removing it would compromise the aircraft’s recognizability.",
      "question": "Is there a rounded, transparent cockpit canopy located at the front of the fuselage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The wings are straight and extend symmetrically from the fuselage, with a slight upward angle (dihedral). Their shape and attachment point are essential for aerodynamic identity. Even in a stylized model, the wing shape must be preserved to maintain visual accuracy.",
      "question": "Do the wings extend straight and symmetrically from the fuselage, forming a dihedral angle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The tail assembly includes a vertical stabilizer and horizontal stabilizers with small fins at the tips. This configuration is standard for this aircraft type and contributes to its balance and control. It must be preserved to maintain structural authenticity.",
      "question": "Is the tail section composed of a vertical stabilizer and two horizontal stabilizers with small fins at the ends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
