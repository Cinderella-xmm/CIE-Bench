      "thinking_process": "The woman’s **silver hair** and **black-rimmed glasses** are core identity features. These distinguish her from other figures and are essential for recognition. Even in a silhouette, their shape and position must be preserved to ensure the subject remains identifiable. Losing either would compromise the character’s identity, making it unrecognizable. Therefore, this is a 3-point question.",

      "thinking_process": "The **open book held in both hands** is the central action of the scene. It defines the purpose of the image—the act of reading. Even if enlarged, the book must still be held in the same way, with fingers gripping the pages. Altering this interaction would disrupt the functional logic of the scene. Thus, it is a critical element with weight 3.",

      "thinking_process": "The **cat** is a distinctive element in the lower-right corner. Its presence adds charm and balance to the composition. Even if stylized, its **position on the rug** and **orientation (looking upward)** must remain consistent to preserve scene coherence. Removing or relocating it would alter the visual narrative. This is a 2-point question due to its importance in scene completeness.",

Its **position to the left of the chair** and **function as a stand for the mug** are logical and visually significant. Removing or altering this would break the scene’s symmetry and functionality.
