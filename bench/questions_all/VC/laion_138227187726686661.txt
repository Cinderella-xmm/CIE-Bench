**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a neatly made bed in a child’s bedroom, featuring a sports-themed quilt with patchwork squares containing images of various sports balls: footballs (red with white laces), basketballs (orange with black lines), soccer balls (black and white hexagons), and baseballs (white with red stitching). The quilt has a blue border and uses a palette of blue, yellow, green, and white. The pattern includes star motifs in blue and white scattered across the design. A matching pillow with the same sports ball pattern rests against a plain white pillow. The bed has a dark wooden headboard with an X-shaped cross brace design. The room has light blue walls, a window with white trim allowing natural light to enter, and a dark wood floor. A small nightstand with a striped lampshade and a framed photo sits beside the bed. On the floor near the bed is a blue shag rug with a real soccer ball placed on it. Above the bed hangs a framed black-and-white photograph depicting silhouettes of people skateboarding.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction specifies several transformations:
- **Transform the sports-themed bedspread into a vibrant LEGO block quilt**: This means the *form* of the quilt changes from fabric-based patchwork to LEGO-like blocks.
- **Use multicolored blocks to recreate the original patchwork design, mimicking balls with round tile pieces**: This allows for reinterpretation of the *pattern*, but not necessarily the *exact form* of the balls—only their representation via LEGO tiles.
- **Replace the pillow with a cube of stacked LEGO bricks**: The pillow's *function* (support) remains, but its *form* changes completely.
- **Place the quilt and pillow on a plain white LEGO baseplate bed**: The bed structure is replaced entirely with a LEGO-style baseplate, implying a shift in material and texture.
- **Set against a smooth white background for a playful and tactile visual effect**: The entire scene environment (walls, window, floor, furniture) is changed.

Thus, **everything except the core visual concept**—the *sports ball motif* and *patchwork layout*—is allowed to be transformed.

**Allowed Changes List:**
- The quilt’s material and texture (from fabric to LEGO blocks)
- The pillow’s form (from fabric to LEGO brick cube)
- The bed frame (from dark wood to white LEGO baseplate)
- The surrounding environment (blue walls, window, nightstand, rug, photo frame, etc.)
- The lighting and overall atmosphere
- The color scheme of the quilt (though "vibrant" suggests similar brightness, not necessarily identical colors)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
We now identify elements that must remain unchanged based on the principle of **core recognition**, **functional logic**, and **visual coherence**:

- **Core recognition elements**: The *sports ball imagery* is central to the identity of the original quilt. Even if rendered in LEGO form, the presence and arrangement of footballs, basketballs, soccer balls, and baseballs must be preserved as identifiable symbols. These are not just decorative—they define the theme.
- **Functional/logical association elements**: The quilt’s *patchwork layout* (grid of squares with alternating patterns) and the *presence of stars* between the balls are part of the design logic. They help maintain the visual rhythm and thematic consistency. If these are lost, the design becomes unrecognizable as a variation of the original.
- **Non-modified element deduction**: While the background, furniture, and materials are explicitly changed, the *content* of the quilt’s pattern—the specific types of balls and their positions within the grid—is implied to be retained through the instruction “recreate the original patchwork design.” Thus, the *identity* of the pattern must survive.

Additionally, although the instruction says “mimicking balls with round tile pieces,” this implies the *shapes* of the balls must still be present—even if stylized. Therefore, the *iconic forms* of each sport ball (e.g., black-and-white hexagonal soccer ball, red oval football with laces) must be preserved in shape and placement.

The *relative position* of the balls within the patchwork grid is also important for pattern recognition. For example, if the football appears in a yellow square and the soccer ball in a blue one, those spatial relationships should be maintained.

**Preservation Targets List:**
- The presence of footballs (red with white laces)
- The presence of basketballs (orange with black lines)
- The presence of soccer balls (black and white hexagon pattern)
- The presence of baseballs (white with red stitching)
- The patchwork grid layout of squares
- The inclusion of blue and white stars between the ball motifs
- The relative positioning of the balls within the grid (e.g., football in top-left, soccer ball in center, etc.)

Note: The *color palette* may change due to LEGO bricks being used, but the *types* of balls and their *positions* must remain consistent.

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The red football with white laces is a core identifying feature of the quilt’s sports theme. Its distinct oval shape and lacing pattern are unique to American footballs and distinguish it from other balls. If this element is omitted or replaced with a non-football shape, the quilt loses its thematic integrity. Since the instruction says to “mimic” the balls with LEGO tiles, the shape must still be recognizable. Thus, preserving the football’s form is essential for identity recognition and carries maximum weight.
    Question: Is the red football with white laces present in the quilt’s design?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The soccer ball’s black-and-white hexagonal pattern is iconic and instantly recognizable. It is one of the most prominent elements in the quilt and serves as a key visual anchor. Replacing it with a generic round tile would fail to preserve the intended theme. Even in LEGO form, the pattern must retain the characteristic black pentagons and white hexagons to be identifiable. Therefore, its presence is critical for maintaining the original design’s identity.

    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The orange basketball with black lines is another defining element of the sports theme. Its circular shape and distinctive line pattern differentiate it from other balls. Removing or altering this would distort the thematic balance of the quilt. Since the instruction requires recreating the original patchwork design, the basketball must appear in the same relative location and form.
    Question: Is the orange basketball with black lines present in the quilt’s design?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The white baseball with red stitching is a smaller but significant detail that contributes to the variety of sports represented. It adds completeness to the sports theme. Its presence ensures the quilt is not limited to just three sports. Even in LEGO form, the red stitching must be visible to maintain recognition. Omitting it would reduce the richness of the design and compromise the original intent.

    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

}

{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The patchwork grid layout of squares is a structural element that defines the quilt’s composition. It organizes the sports balls and stars into a coherent pattern. If the layout is changed to a random or solid block arrangement, the design loses its original aesthetic and becomes unrecognizable. The instruction specifies “recreate the original patchwork design,” which implies the grid must be preserved.
    Question: Is the quilt composed of a grid of colored squares arranged in a patchwork pattern?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

}

{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The blue and white stars are recurring decorative elements that enhance the sports theme and provide visual contrast. They are not functional but are integral to the quilt’s design language. Their absence would make the pattern feel incomplete or unbalanced. Since they appear consistently in the original, they must be included in the LEGO version to maintain visual fidelity.
    Question: Are blue and white stars present between the sports ball motifs in the quilt?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The relative positioning of the sports balls within the grid is crucial for pattern recognition. For example, the football in the top-left corner, the soccer ball near the center, etc. Changing their positions would disrupt the visual logic and make the design unrecognizable as a recreation of the original. The instruction implies preservation of the design, so spatial relationships must be maintained.
    Question: Are the sports balls positioned in the same relative locations within the patchwork grid as in the original?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
