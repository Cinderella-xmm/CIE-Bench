      "thinking_process": "The dual curved horns on the helmet are the most iconic and defining feature of the figure's headgear. Their shape—curved upward and outward—and their position atop the skull-like helmet are critical to identifying the figure. Removing or altering them would fundamentally change the character's identity, making it unrecognizable. This is a core identity element, hence weighted at 3 points.",
      "question": "Are the two prominent curved horns on top of the helmet still present and retaining their original shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The skull-like faceplate with glowing red eyes is central to the figure’s menacing expression and supernatural aura. The red eyes are particularly significant—they are not just colored but emit a faint glow, distinguishing this figure from standard armored warriors. Changing the eye color or eliminating the glow would remove a key emotional and visual cue. This is a core identification feature, so it receives a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the faceplate still skull-shaped with clearly visible, glowing red eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The massive spiked shoulder pauldrons with red vein-like patterns are highly distinctive and serve as major visual anchors. These elements are not only decorative but also symbolic of the figure’s power and possibly biomechanical nature. The red veins suggest internal systems or energy flow, which is part of its design language. Any alteration to their shape or removal of the red patterns would compromise the figure’s unique aesthetic. This is a key accessory element, so it is assigned 2 points.",
      "question": "Do the shoulder pauldrons retain their large, spiked structure and the red vein-like patterns embedded within them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The segmented chest armor with riveted plating defines the torso’s mechanical and layered appearance. The arrangement of horizontal plates and the presence of rivets contribute to the industrial feel of the armor. If this structure were flattened or simplified, the figure would lose its complex, engineered look. This is a crucial structural element that supports the overall design logic, so it is rated at 2 points.",
      "question": "Does the chest armor maintain its segmented, layered design with visible rivets and mechanical joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The clawed gauntlets are essential to the figure’s aggressive posture and combat-ready appearance. They are clearly defined with sharp, talon-like fingers and integrated into the arm armor. Their presence reinforces the warrior nature of the figure. While minor modifications might be acceptable (like adding mechanical details), their basic form must remain unchanged. This is a functional detail tied to the figure’s identity, so it gets 2 points.",
      "question": "Are the hands still equipped with clawed gauntlets featuring sharp, pointed fingers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The weathered, battle-scarred texture of the metallic surface is a key detail that conveys history and use. It includes scratches, dents, and discoloration across the armor, especially noticeable on the chest and shoulders. This texture adds realism and depth to the figure. Even if new elements like copper piping are added, the underlying texture must remain visible. This is a secondary but important detail for visual consistency, so it is given 1 point.",
      "question": "Is the original weathered and scarred texture of the armor still visible across the chest, shoulders, and limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The overall silhouette and proportions of the figure—its broad shoulders, narrow waist, and upright stance—are fundamental to its imposing presence. Any distortion in height, width, or limb ratio would make the figure appear off-model. Since the instruction allows scaling down, the proportions must be preserved even in miniature form. This is a foundational visual trait, so it is worth 2 points.",
      "question": "Does the figure maintain its original silhouette and proportional relationship between head, torso, and limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
