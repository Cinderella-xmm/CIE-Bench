**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is Mount Fuji, a symmetrical stratovolcano with a prominent snow-capped peak dominating the upper half of the frame. The mountain’s conical shape is clearly defined, with a smooth, white snow cap covering the summit and upper slopes, transitioning into darker brown and green vegetated lower slopes. Below the mountain, a wide expanse of flat land features patches of autumnal-colored trees and open fields in shades of yellow, green, and brown. A calm lake occupies the foreground, perfectly reflecting the entire mountain and sky above, creating a near-symmetrical mirror image. Along the shoreline, small buildings and structures—likely lakeside homes or lodges—are visible, arranged linearly. The sky is a deep, clear blue with a few scattered, thin clouds, enhancing the contrast with the white peak. The overall composition emphasizes balance, symmetry, and natural serenity.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction explicitly states: *"Transform the majestic mountain scene into a delicate miniature encased within a glass terrarium."* This indicates that the **form and scale** of the entire scene are to be changed — from a full-scale natural landscape to a **miniature diorama**. The materials used (glittering textured snow, fine-brushed foliage, translucent resin lake, tiny chalet figurines) suggest **material transformation**, not preservation of original textures. However, the instruction specifies **how** to represent certain elements (e.g., "snow-capped peaks using textured, glittering materials"), implying that the **presence and form** of those elements must still reflect their original counterparts.

Key transformations mentioned:
- **Form**: From real-world landscape → miniature terrarium
- **Materials**: Natural snow → glittering textured material; natural vegetation → fine-brushed foliage; natural lake → translucent resin layer; real buildings → tiny chalet figurines
- **Scale**: Full-size → miniature
- **Environment**: Open nature → enclosed glass terrarium

But the instruction does **not** state that the **identity or structure** of Mount Fuji should be altered — it only describes how to *recreate* it in a new medium. Therefore, **the core visual identity of Mount Fuji** — its shape, snow cap, reflection, and surrounding landscape — must remain recognizable despite the transformation.

Thus, allowed changes include:
- Material substitution (e.g., real snow → glitter)
- Scale reduction (full size → miniature)
- Enclosure in a glass terrarium
- Use of artificial materials for all components
- Replacement of real buildings with figurines

However, the **iconic form and layout** of the mountain and its reflection must be preserved for recognition.

**Allowed Changes List:**
(Specific element 1 that allows for changes): The texture and material of the snow cap (can be replaced with glittering, textured material)  
(Specific element 2 that allows for changes): The texture and color of the forested slopes (can be replaced with fine-brushed foliage)  
(Specific element 3 that allows for changes): The surface of the lake (can be replaced with translucent resin)  
(Specific element 4 that allows for changes): The buildings along the shore (can be replaced with tiny chalet figurines)  
(Specific element 5 that allows for changes): The overall scale and framing (can be reduced to a miniature within a glass terrarium)  
(Specific element 6 that allows for changes): The background environment (can be enclosed in a glass terrarium, altering depth perception)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
We now exclude the allowed changes to identify what **must remain unchanged** based on:

1. **Core recognition elements**: Mount Fuji is an iconic landmark globally recognized by its **perfect conical shape**, **symmetrical snow cap**, and **reflection in a lake**. These are essential for identification. Even in a miniature version, if the shape is distorted or the reflection is absent, it would no longer be recognizable as Mount Fuji. Thus, the **overall silhouette**, **snow-covered peak**, and **mirror reflection** must be preserved in form, even if materials change.

2. **Functional/logical association elements**: The reflection in the lake is not just aesthetic — it's a **key compositional and logical feature** of this specific view of Mount Fuji (e.g., Lake Kawaguchi). The lake's presence and its role in mirroring the mountain are integral to the scene’s identity. Removing or distorting the reflection would break the scene’s logic and recognition value.

3. **Non-modified element deduction**: While the instructions allow changing materials and scale, they do **not** permit changing the **position, shape, or orientation** of key elements. For example:
   - The **mountain remains central**
   - The **lake is at the base**
   - The **buildings are along the shore**
   - The **sky is above**
   - The **reflection is inverted below**

These spatial relationships are **not mentioned as changeable**, so they must be retained for coherence.

Additionally, the **snow cap must remain white and cover the summit**, the **mountain must be symmetrical**, and the **lake must reflect the mountain** — these are non-negotiable for identity.

**Preservation Targets List:**
(Element 1 that should be maintained): The symmetrical conical shape of Mount Fuji  
(Element 2 that should be maintained): The snow-covered peak of the mountain  
(Element 3 that should be maintained): The presence of a reflective lake at the base of the mountain  
(Element 4 that should be maintained): The mirror image of the mountain reflected in the lake  
(Element 5 that should be maintained): The position of the shoreline with buildings along the edge of the lake  
(Element 6 that should be maintained): The relative positioning of the mountain, lake, and sky in a balanced composition

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The symmetrical conical shape of Mount Fuji is its most defining and universally recognized feature. It is the primary identifier of the mountain in any representation. If the shape is altered (e.g., flattened, skewed, or asymmetric), the image would no longer be identifiable as Mount Fuji. This is a core identity element, making it essential to retain even in a stylized or miniature form. Therefore, this question targets the fundamental geometric form of the mountain.
    Question: Is the mountain depicted as a symmetrical, perfectly conical shape with a pointed peak?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The snow cap is a critical component of Mount Fuji’s appearance, especially in this image where it dominates the upper portion. Its presence and white coloration are essential for recognition. Even if made of glittering material, the snow cap must remain white and cover the summit. Removing or replacing it with a different color or texture would misrepresent the mountain. This is a core identity feature, hence high weight.
    Question: Does the summit of the mountain have a continuous white snow cap covering the top?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The lake’s reflection is a hallmark of this particular view of Mount Fuji. It creates a near-perfect mirror image, doubling the visual impact and contributing to the scene’s iconic status. Without this reflection, the image loses its signature aesthetic and becomes unrecognizable as this specific scene. Even in a miniature model, the reflection must be present and aligned with the mountain’s shape.
    Question: Is there a clear, mirror-like reflection of the mountain in the lake below?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The shoreline with buildings is a secondary but important detail that anchors the scene in reality. It provides scale and context, distinguishing this from a pure abstract or natural landscape. While the buildings may be replaced with figurines, their presence along the water’s edge must be preserved. Their position and alignment with the lake and mountain are crucial for maintaining scene logic and coherence.
    Question: Are there small structures or buildings positioned along the edge of the lake, between the water and the mountain base?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The sky is part of the original composition and contributes to the contrast with the white peak. Although the instruction allows material changes, the sky’s position above the mountain and its clear blue color are visually consistent with the original. While the color could theoretically shift due to lighting in a terrarium, the sky must still occupy the upper portion of the image and appear distinct from the mountain and lake. Its presence helps define the scene’s spatial layout.
    Question: Is the sky visible above the mountain, appearing as a solid or gradient blue area?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The slope transition from snow to dark rock to vegetation is a key detail that adds depth and realism to the mountain. While the materials can be changed (e.g., painted layers instead of natural terrain), the layered progression from white (snow) to brown (rock) to green/yellow (vegetation) must be preserved to maintain the mountain’s realistic profile. This is a detail-level feature but essential for visual consistency.
    Question: Are there visible layers on the mountain’s slopes, showing a transition from white snow at the top to darker rock and then to green/brown vegetation below?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
