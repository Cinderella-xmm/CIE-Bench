Description of reference image: The subject is a chimney sweep depicted in a retro-style illustration. He is shown in profile, facing right, holding a long-handled brush over his shoulder. He wears a cap, a jacket, and gloves. A coiled hose is slung across his back. To the left of the figure is a brick chimney. The background consists of a yellow circle enclosed within a gray ring. The overall design has a stylized, simplified aesthetic.

### Step 1 - Allowed Changes List:

**Thinking process:**  
The instructions specify transforming the image into a comic book style with bold outlines and halftone shading. This means the artistic style can be altered. The scene is to be changed to include a grimy cityscape, indicating the background can be replaced. The yellow circle is to be retained as a dramatic background element, suggesting its position and color may stay consistent. The addition of a gritty caption implies textual content can be added.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
- Artistic style (changing from retro-style illustration to comic book style with bold outlines and halftone shading).  
- Scene transformation (replacing the current background with a grimy cityscape).  
- Addition of text (adding a gritty caption at the bottom).  

### Step 2 - Preservation Targets List:

**Thinking process:**  
Core recognition elements include the chimney sweepâ€™s profession-specific tools (brush and hose) and attire (cap, jacket, gloves). Functional/logical elements involve the chimney sweep holding the brush and having the hose slung over his back, as these support the action of cleaning chimneys. Remaining elements like the brick chimney and the yellow circle contribute to visual coherence.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
- Chimney sweep holding the brush over his shoulder.  
- Coiled hose slung across the chimney sweep's back.  
- Brick chimney positioned to the left of the chimney sweep.  
- Yellow circle as a background element.  
- Chimney sweep wearing a cap, jacket, and gloves.
