**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject consists of two identical terracotta-colored ceramic vases, each featuring a stylized artichoke-like design with layered, petal-shaped protrusions forming the rim. The vases are symmetrical in shape, with a wide bowl-like opening tapering down to a flared base that rests on a short, rounded pedestal. The texture appears matte and earthy, consistent with unglazed clay. Both vases are positioned slightly offset from one another against a plain white background, with soft shadows indicating even studio lighting. The overall form is organic yet structured, emphasizing natural botanical inspiration through sculpted leaf-like elements around the upper edge.

Thinking process:  
The editing instruction explicitly states transformation into a high-end ceramics brand packaging called "Earth Elegance," involving changes such as converting the clay texture to a marbled ceramic finish, adding branding decals and gold leaf accents, designing packaging with cross-sectional views of vase interiors, and incorporating a matte black box with bronze typography. These modifications target surface material, decorative elements, and surrounding context (packaging), but do not mention altering the fundamental **form**, **shape**, or **structural composition** of the vases themselves. The core **artichoke-inspired silhouette** and **layered petal structure** are implied to be preserved as part of the artistic motif in the new packaging design ("artichoke-like pattern as decorative motif"). Therefore, while texture, color, and added elements can change, the **iconic shape and structural layout** must remain recognizable.

Allowed Changes List:  
- Surface texture (clay → marbled ceramic)  
- Color scheme (terracotta → possibly neutral or polished tones with gold accents)  
- Added decorative elements (branding decals, gold leaf)  
- Packaging design (matte black box, bronze typography, cross-sectional interior view)  
- Background environment (white → branded packaging context)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements: The **artichoke-like layered petal structure** is the defining visual feature of these vases. It is both the primary aesthetic identity and functional form—each petal is carefully shaped and arranged in concentric layers around the rim, forming a crown-like profile. This unique configuration distinguishes them from standard vessels and is central to their artistic identity. Even if texture or finish changes, the **spatial arrangement and three-dimensional form** of the petals must remain intact for recognition.

Functional/logical association elements: The **vase’s open bowl shape** serves a functional purpose (holding objects). While this may be altered by packaging, the **interior cavity and its relationship to the petal structure** must remain consistent so that the cross-sectional view described in the instructions accurately reflects the original form. Additionally, the **pedestal base** supports the vessel; removing or reshaping it would alter structural logic.

Non-modified element deduction: After excluding allowed changes (texture, color, branding, background), the following remain:
- The **number of vases (two)**  
- Their **relative positioning (slightly offset)**  
- The **overall silhouette and symmetry**  
- The **petal count and layering pattern**  
- The **presence of a defined bowl and base**  

These are essential to maintaining continuity between original and edited versions, especially since the packaging will reference the vase's internal structure.

Preservation Targets List:  
- The artichoke-like layered petal structure around the rim  
- The presence of two identical vases  
- The open bowl-shaped interior  
- The flared pedestal base supporting the body  
- The symmetrical and organic form of each vase

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The layered petal structure forming the rim is the most distinctive feature of the vases. Each petal is sculpted in a teardrop shape and arranged in overlapping rows, creating a crown-like effect reminiscent of an artichoke. This is the core identity element—without it, the object would no longer be recognizable as the same design. Its preservation is critical for maintaining visual continuity and brand recognition in the "Earth Elegance" packaging.
    Question: Does the edited image retain the layered petal structure around the rim of each vase, with individual petal shapes clearly visible and arranged in concentric rows?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The number of vases is a key compositional detail. The original image shows exactly two vases, placed side by side with slight offset. Changing this quantity would fundamentally alter the scene’s balance and intent. Since the packaging design references “cross-sectional views” of the vases, implying multiple units, the count must remain unchanged to preserve logical consistency.
    Question: Are there exactly two vases present in the edited image?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The open bowl-shaped interior is functionally and visually integral. The editing instruction mentions using a “cross-sectional view of vase interiors,” which implies that the internal cavity must remain structurally intact. Altering the depth, curvature, or openness of the bowl would invalidate this representation and disrupt the intended design narrative.
    Question: Is the interior of each vase still open and bowl-shaped, allowing visibility into the cavity?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The pedestal base provides structural support and contributes to the vase’s elegant silhouette. While the material may change (clay to marbled ceramic), the base’s shape—a flared, rounded foot—must be retained to maintain proportion and balance. Removing or flattening it would compromise the vase’s form and affect how it is perceived in the packaging.
    Question: Does each vase have a distinct, flared pedestal base beneath the main body?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: Symmetry and alignment contribute to the aesthetic harmony of the design. The original vases are identical in shape and size, with mirrored forms. Even if texture or color changes, the symmetry between the two vases must be preserved to maintain visual coherence and reinforce the idea of a set product. Asymmetric alterations could misrepresent the design intent.
    Question: Are the two vases identical in shape, size, and orientation, with only minor positional offset?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
