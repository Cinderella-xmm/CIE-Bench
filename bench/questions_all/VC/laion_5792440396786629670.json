      "thinking_process": "The presence of the \"HOMEPAGE\" node at the top center is the core identity feature of the site map. It serves as the root of the entire structure and contains the mission statement. Even if stylized as a castle, its position and role as the starting point must be preserved. Losing it would break the site map’s functionality and identity.",

      "thinking_process": "The branching structure from the Homepage to the five main categories (Products & Solutions, About Us, etc.) defines the primary navigation. The existence of exactly five first-level nodes is critical to maintaining the original architecture. Even if replaced with icons, their number and connection to the homepage must be preserved.",

      "thinking_process": "The \"to the web\" logo in the top-left corner is a branding element and part of the original composition.
