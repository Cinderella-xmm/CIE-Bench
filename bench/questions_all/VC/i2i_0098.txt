Description of reference image:  
The subject is a modern bathroom sink setup featuring a minimalist design. The image contains a white oval-shaped basin placed on a wooden vanity cabinet with a clean, straight line design. The countertop has simple metal handles and a matte finish. A golden faucet is positioned centrally behind the sink. To the left on the countertop is a small, dark-colored vase holding a stem with red flowers, and a cork stopper lies beside it. The wall is tiled with large white marble-style tiles with subtle gray veining. The room is illuminated by two cylindrical pendant lights on either side of a large rectangular mirror mounted above the sink.

### Step 1 - Allowed Changes List:

Thinking process:  
The instructions specify replacing the mirror with a minimalist landscape wall art using fabric canvas material. This means the size, shape, and placement of the mirror can change, though the general space it occupies should likely remain consistent to avoid disrupting the overall composition. The rest of the scene, including the sink, vanity, lighting, wall tiles, and vase, should ideally stay the same unless their presence is in conflict with the new wall art.

Allowed Changes List:  
1. The mirror shape, type, and material can be changed to a minimalist landscape wall art on fabric canvas.  
2. The exact dimensions of the wall art can adjust, provided it fits within the current mirror's area.  

### Step 2 - Preservation Targets List:

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements include the sink, vase with flowers, and the overall modern bathroom aesthetic. The sink and vanity are central to the function of the image, while the flowers add a decorative touch that enhances the scene. Functional/logical association elements include the placement of the sink relative to the vanity and wall. Visual coherence relies on retaining the marble tiles, lighting, and overall clean design.

Preservation Targets List:  
1. The white oval-shaped sink and its placement on the wooden vanity.  
2. The golden faucet and its position relative to the sink.  
3. The dark-colored vase with red flowers on the countertop.  
4. The marble-style wall tiles with gray veining.  
5. The two cylindrical pendant lights flanking the wall art.
