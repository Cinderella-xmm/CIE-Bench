It is a unique alphanumeric code used for official identification, and its absence or alteration would render the ship unrecognizable as the original subject. This is a core identity feature that must be preserved regardless of stylistic changes like brass plating or gear integration.",

      "thinking_process": "The British flag on the secondary mast is a key national identifier linked to the ship’s heritage. Its presence confirms the vessel’s origin and historical context. Even in a steampunk rendering, the flag must retain its red, white, and blue colors and Union Jack design to maintain authenticity and recognition.",

      "thinking_process": "The silhouette of the ship—including the tall mast, funnel, and gun mount—is essential for identifying it as a naval vessel of a particular class. Altering these shapes would change the vessel’s classification and make it unrecognizable. These structural features are non-negotiable for maintaining the subject’s identity.",
      "question": "Does the ship retain its original silhouette with a tall mast, funnel, and forward gun mount?",

      "thinking_process": "The green lampposts with curved arms are distinctive architectural elements of the dock. They contribute to the scene’s visual rhythm and period feel. Their color and shape must be preserved to maintain consistency with the original setting, even if rendered in brass or with mechanical embellishments.",
      "question": "Are the green lampposts with curved arms present along the pier?",

      "thinking_process": "The three pedestrians walking along the pier represent human activity and scale. Their positions and direction of movement help ground the scene. Even if transformed into automatons, their arrangement and path must align with the original to preserve narrative coherence.",
