      "thinking_process": "The pig’s snout is a core identification feature — its round shape, pink color, and dual nostrils are biologically unique to pigs and distinguish it from other animals. Losing this would make the subject unrecognizable as a pig. This is a 3-point weight because it is essential for species identification.",
      "question": "Is the pig’s snout clearly visible with two distinct nostrils and a rounded, pink shape?",

      "thinking_process": "The large, upright ears with visible inner pink structure are iconic to the pig’s appearance and help distinguish it from other animals. Their shape and position are key to visual recognition. Altering them significantly would compromise identity. This is a 3-point weight due to its role in species-specific morphology.",
      "question": "Are the pig’s ears large, upright, and pink with visible inner ear details?",

      "thinking_process": "The red round sunglasses are a signature accessory in the original image, contributing both style and character identity. While the instruction allows changing them to green in another version, in the original image, the **red color and round lens shape** must be preserved. This is a 3-point weight because it is a distinctive visual identifier of the character.",
      "question": "Are the sunglasses red in color with round lenses and a thin frame?",

      "thinking_process": "The DJ turntable is a functional object tied to the pig’s role as a DJ. Its presence and interaction with the pig’s hands are crucial for maintaining logical coherence. The platter, tonearm, and mixer controls are specific components that define the equipment. Removing or distorting these would break the scene’s logic. This is a 2-point weight as it is important for scene functionality.",
      "question": "Is there a black turntable with a silver platter, tonearm, and mixer controls beneath the pig’s hands?",

      "thinking_process": "The black over-ear headphones around the pig’s neck are part of the DJ aesthetic and provide continuity in the character’s role. Their presence supports the musical theme and is visually distinct. While stylization may occur, the basic shape and position must remain. This is a 2-point weight as it is a key accessory tied to function.",

Although the instruction allows cartoon styling, the shirt’s presence and basic form should be retained. This is a 1-point weight as it is a minor detail but still aids in character consistency.",

If the hands were absent or mispositioned, the action would be unclear. This is a 2-point weight due to its functional importance.",

While the instruction allows cartoon style, the original texture should be preserved unless explicitly altered. This is a 1-point weight as it is a detail-level element affecting visual fidelity.",
