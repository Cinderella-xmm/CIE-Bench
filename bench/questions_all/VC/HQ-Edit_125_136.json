      "thinking_process": "The American flag patch on the astronaut’s right shoulder is a core identity feature, distinguishing this astronaut as part of the U.S. space program. Its presence and position are critical for recognizing the astronaut’s national affiliation. If removed or relocated, the astronaut’s identity would be misaligned with known missions. Therefore, this element is essential and weighs 3 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The NASA insignia patch on the left shoulder is another key identifier, directly linking the astronaut to NASA. It complements the flag and together forms a standard uniform marking. Removing or altering it would compromise the authenticity of the astronaut’s representation. This is a core identity element, hence 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the blue NASA insignia patch visible on the left shoulder of the astronaut?",

      "thinking_process": "The reflection of Earth in the helmet visor is a unique compositional feature that establishes the spatial relationship between Earth, Moon, and astronaut. It is not only visually striking but also scientifically accurate. Its absence would break the narrative continuity and visual logic of the scene. Thus, it is a critical retention point with a weight of 3.",
      "question": "Is Earth visible in the reflection within the astronaut’s helmet visor, appearing above the lunar horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "thinking_process": "The ISS in the background is a major scene element required by the instruction to be retained. Its distinctive shape—with cylindrical modules and large solar arrays—is essential for identification. Even if simplified, its core structure must remain recognizable. Losing this would violate the requirement to preserve the space station, making the infographic contextually inaccurate. This is a key scene element, thus 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the International Space Station visible in the background with its solar panels and modular structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The lunar surface beneath the astronaut must remain identifiable as a cratered, gray terrain. This grounds the scene and confirms the setting as the Moon. While texture may be simplified, the presence of craters and the gray tone are necessary for environmental accuracy. This is an important scene detail affecting coherence, so it carries 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the ground beneath the astronaut visibly cratered and gray, consistent with the Moon’s surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The astronaut’s forward-facing posture and helmet with dual illuminated side lights define the character’s stance and equipment. The lights are functional and symbolic, indicating active systems. Changing their position or removing them would alter the perception of the astronaut’s readiness and visibility. This is a key detail supporting the subject’s identity and function, so it is worth 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the astronaut facing forward with both side lights on the helmet illuminated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
