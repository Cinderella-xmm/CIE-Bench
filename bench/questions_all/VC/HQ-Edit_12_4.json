      "thinking_process": "The Roman numerals (I–XII) are the key identification feature of the watch face. They are essential for recognizing the object as a traditional analog pocket watch. Without them, the watch would be unidentifiable as such. Their presence and arrangement are iconic and cannot be replaced by Arabic numerals or other symbols. This is a core identity element, hence weight 3.",
      "question": "Is the watch face marked with Roman numerals from I to XII?",

      "thinking_process": "The circular shape of the watch face is fundamental to its identity. Any deviation (e.g., oval or rectangular) would alter the object’s classification. This is a core structural feature, critical for recognition. Losing this would make the object unrecognizable as a pocket watch, thus weight 3.",
      "question": "Is the watch face perfectly circular?",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The small seconds subdial at the 6 o’clock position is a distinctive functional detail found in many vintage pocket watches. Its presence confirms the watch’s mechanical complexity and authenticity. It is a key accessory feature, not just decoration. Altering or removing it would compromise the watch’s identity, so it must be preserved. Weight 3.",
      "question": "Is there a smaller circular subdial located at the 6 o’clock position on the watch face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The ornate engraved pattern on the silver casing is a defining aesthetic feature of the watch. It contributes to its vintage character and distinguishes it from plain models. Even if scaled down in a miniature scene, the engraving must remain visible and consistent in style. This is a key decorative element tied to the watch’s identity, so it must be retained. Weight 2.",
      "question": "Does the outer casing of the pocket watch feature detailed ornamental engravings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The winding crown and attached loop are functional components unique to pocket watches. The crown allows winding, and the loop enables attachment to a chain. These are signature parts that identify the object as a pocket watch rather than a wristwatch or clock. Their absence would render the object unrecognizable. Thus, they are core identity elements. Weight 3.",
      "question": "Is there a knurled winding crown with a metal loop attached to the top of the watch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The fabric’s floral and paisley embroidery is a distinct visual pattern that adds richness to the composition. While the instruction allows golden thread, it does not allow replacing the pattern type. The motif must remain recognizable as floral and paisley. This is a key background element that supports the watch’s presentation. Changing it would disrupt visual coherence. Weight 2.",
      "question": "Does the fabric beneath the watch feature floral and paisley embroidery patterns?",
      "choices": [

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The white dial with black Roman numerals and hands is the standard color scheme for classic pocket watches. Changing this to another color combination (e.g., dark dial with light numbers) would alter the visual identity. Although the instruction mentions \"earthy, vibrant tones,\" this refers to the book and cloth coloring, not necessarily the watch face. Thus, the dial color remains unchanged. This is a key visual contrast element. Weight 2.",
      "question": "Is the watch face white with black Roman numerals and black hands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
