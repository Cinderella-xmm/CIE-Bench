**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a man riding an elephant in a ceremonial setting. The rider wears a red turban, a multicolored embroidered vest over a long-sleeved shirt (red on the left, blue on the right), white pants, and multiple orange marigold garlands around his neck. He sits upright on the elephant’s back, facing slightly to the right. The elephant is dark gray with large ears, a long trunk, and is adorned with elaborate orange marigold garlands draped across its head, trunk, and body, including a central decorative pendant at the forehead. The elephant's feet are decorated with ornamental anklets featuring colorful beads. The scene takes place under an arched gateway with intricate stone carvings, flanked by two columns with floral motifs and hanging tassels (green and orange). In the background, there are domed structures resembling Mughal architecture, with people dressed in traditional Indian attire walking along a path strewn with marigold petals. The sky is clear and bright blue.

Thinking process:  
The editing instruction specifies transforming the image into a **Mughal miniature painting**, which implies a complete stylistic overhaul—using fine brushwork, gold accents, vermilion hues, and ornate patterns typical of Mughal art. However, it does not state that the core subject (elephant, rider, archway) should be replaced or removed, only reimagined in a new artistic style. The instruction allows changes to:
- Style of the artwork (from realistic to miniature painting)
- Clothing of the rider (to traditional Mughal attire)
- Decoration of the elephant (adding floral motifs)
- Architecture (reimagined with detailed Mughal arches and minarets)
- Crowd (transformed into courtly figures with jewel-like patterns)

However, the instruction **does not mention altering the presence or basic form** of the elephant, rider, archway, or key symbolic elements like marigold garlands or the positioning of the scene. Therefore, these core visual elements must be preserved in their fundamental forms even if stylized.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
- Artistic style (realistic → Mughal miniature painting)  
- Rider’s clothing (to traditional Mughal attire with opulent turban)  
- Elephant’s decoration (addition of ornate floral motifs)  
- Architectural details (arches, domes, minarets reimagined with Mughal design)  
- Background crowd (transformed into courtly figures with delicate brushwork and jewel-like patterns)  
- Color palette (shift toward gold and vermilion hues)  
- Texture and rendering (to match miniature painting technique)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements must remain intact because they define the identity of the scene and subjects. For example:
- The **elephant** is the central figure; changing its shape or replacing it would fundamentally alter the subject.
- The **rider’s position** on the elephant’s back and his **upright posture** are essential for narrative coherence.
- The **arched gateway** with **columns and hanging tassels** defines the spatial context and framing of the scene.
- The **marigold garlands** are iconic ceremonial elements, symbolizing celebration and cultural context—removing them would lose cultural specificity.
- The **presence of people in the background** and **petals on the ground** contribute to the festive atmosphere and narrative depth.

Functional/logical associations include:
- The **rider sitting atop the elephant** maintains the logical relationship between human and animal in procession.
- The **positioning under the archway** creates a framed composition, a common device in both real and painted scenes—this spatial logic must be preserved.

Non-modified elements deduced from exclusion:
- Despite stylistic change, the **elephant’s trunk direction**, **ear spread**, and **foot placement** must remain consistent to preserve its anatomical and compositional role.
- The **tassels hanging from the arch** must remain present, as they are part of the architectural detail and cultural symbolism.
- The **overall layout**—rider on elephant, under arch, with crowd behind—must be retained to maintain scene logic.

Preservation Targets List:  
- The presence and general shape of the elephant  
- The rider seated on the elephant’s back  
- The archway with two pillars and scalloped arches  
- The hanging tassels (green and orange) from the arch  
- The marigold garlands on the elephant’s head and body  
- The position of the rider facing slightly to the right  
- The presence of people in the background  
- The marigold petals scattered on the ground  
- The dome-shaped buildings in the background

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The elephant is the central subject of the image. Its presence and overall form (dark gray skin, large ears, long trunk) are essential for identification. Even if rendered in miniature style, the animal must retain its recognizable shape and position. Loss of the elephant would make the scene unrecognizable as a procession involving an elephant. This is a core identity element.
    Question: Is the elephant clearly visible and positioned centrally beneath the archway?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The rider’s location on the elephant’s back is critical for narrative and compositional integrity. The act of riding is central to the scene’s meaning. Changing this would break the functional relationship between rider and animal. The rider must remain seated atop the elephant, maintaining the original spatial arrangement.
    Question: Is the rider seated on the elephant’s back, directly above its spine?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The archway with its distinctive scalloped arch and flanking columns defines the scene’s architectural frame. It is a key environmental feature that anchors the composition. Even if stylized, the structure must remain identifiable to preserve the setting.
    Question: Are the two carved pillars and the scalloped arch forming a gateway visible in the foreground?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The marigold garlands are culturally significant and visually dominant. They adorn both the rider and the elephant and are a defining feature of the ceremonial context. Their absence would remove a major symbolic and aesthetic component of the image.
    Question: Are orange marigold garlands draped over the elephant’s head, trunk, and body?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The hanging tassels (one green, one orange) are specific decorative elements attached to the arch. They add cultural detail and symmetry. Their removal would reduce authenticity and visual balance. While not central to identity, they are important scene elements.
    Question: Are two hanging tassels (one green, one orange) visible from the arch?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The rider’s face and posture (looking slightly to the right) provide narrative direction and engagement. While clothing may change, the facial orientation and gaze must remain consistent to preserve expression and intent.
    Question: Is the rider’s head turned slightly to the right side of the frame?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The marigold petals scattered on the ground reinforce the ceremonial atmosphere and connect to the garlands. Their presence adds continuity and thematic consistency. Though minor, they are part of the environmental detail that supports the scene.
    Question: Are marigold petals visible on the ground around the elephant’s feet?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}
{
    Q8: 
    Thinking process: The background crowd provides context and scale. While their appearance may be stylized into courtly figures, their presence is necessary to convey a public procession. Removing them would isolate the main subject and disrupt narrative completeness.
    Question: Are people visible in the background, walking along the path?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}
{
    Q9: 
    Thinking process: The dome-shaped buildings in the distance establish the architectural setting. They are part of the cultural and spatial context. Even if reimagined, their presence must be preserved to maintain the scene’s location and grandeur.
    Question: Are two dome-shaped structures visible in the background beyond the archway?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
