**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a full-length female figure in traditional Japanese attire, standing sideways with her body facing right and head slightly turned toward the viewer. She wears an elaborate kimono with a deep blue base color adorned with vibrant floral patterns in shades of pink, red, yellow, and white, resembling cherry blossoms and other spring flowers. The kimono features a wide obi (sash) tied at the back, decorated with gold accents and a prominent red-and-yellow patterned bow. Her hair is styled in a formal updo, accented with a large pink floral ornament and dangling tassels. The background consists of two blooming cherry blossom trees with soft pink blossoms and falling petals, set against a pale, hazy sky. The ground is covered with scattered pink petals, creating a serene, springtime atmosphere. The overall lighting is soft and diffused, enhancing the delicate textures of the fabric and blossoms.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction specifies transforming the figure into a **chibi-style character**, which implies a significant change in proportions—smaller head, larger eyes, simplified features, and exaggerated limbs. This transformation allows for a complete reimagining of the **subject’s form**, including facial structure, body ratio, and clothing silhouette. However, the instruction explicitly mentions **enhancing floral patterns and bows with exaggerated, vibrant colors**, indicating that while the **color intensity** may be altered, the **presence and thematic nature** of these elements must remain consistent.  

Additionally, the instruction requires designing **four collectible fridge magnets** featuring the chibi character in different poses related to spring:  
- Holding a cherry blossom branch  
- Catching petals  
- Gazing at blooming trees  
- Dancing amidst falling flowers  

These pose variations suggest changes in **posture, hand positioning, and interaction with environmental elements**, but do not require retention of the original full-body stance or specific angle.  

The scene is not required to be preserved as-is; instead, it will be adapted to fit the new chibi format and magnet presentation on a **pastel-colored magnetic sheet**, meaning the **background environment (cherry trees, sky, ground)** can be modified or abstracted.  

Thus, the allowed changes include:  
- Subject form (transformation into chibi style)  
- Proportions and scale of body parts  
- Facial features (e.g., larger eyes, smaller nose)  
- Clothing shape (simplified folds, exaggerated sleeves)  
- Color saturation of floral patterns and bows (enhanced vibrancy)  
- Pose and gesture (varied across four magnets)  
- Background (replaced with pastel magnetic sheet)  
- Environmental elements (cherry trees, falling petals) — now used as thematic props, not core scenery  

**Allowed Changes List:**  
- Subject’s body proportions (chibi style)  
- Facial features (eyes, mouth, nose)  
- Kimono silhouette (simplified, stylized)  
- Obi design (exaggerated bow size and color)  
- Floral pattern vibrancy (increased saturation)  
- Figure’s posture and gestures (varied across poses)  
- Background environment (cherry trees, sky, ground)  
- Lighting and shadows (adjusted for cartoon style)  
- Scale of elements (petals, branches, etc.)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
Despite the transformation into chibi style and change of context, certain **core recognition elements** must be preserved to maintain visual continuity and identity with the original image. These are derived by excluding the allowed changes and focusing on what remains essential for identification.

1. **Core recognition elements**:  
   - The **kimono’s floral motif**—specifically the presence of **cherry blossom-like flowers** in pink, red, and white—is central to the image’s identity and cultural context. Even if enhanced in color, the **pattern type** must remain recognizable.  
   - The **obis’ decorative structure**—a wide sash with a red-and-yellow patterned bow—is a key identifier of traditional formal wear. While its size and color may be exaggerated, its **presence and function** as a central accessory must be retained.  
   - The **hair ornament**—a large pink flower with dangling tassels—is a distinctive feature of the hairstyle. Its **form and placement** (top of the head, side-facing) should remain intact even if stylized.  

2. **Functional/logical association elements**:  
   - The **connection between the figure and spring themes** is critical. Although the background changes, the **thematic use of cherry blossoms** must persist through props like branches or falling petals. Thus, **the presence of cherry blossoms as a symbolic element** must be preserved.  
   - The **figure’s gender and cultural dress** imply a specific role (e.g., geisha or noblewoman). While stylized, the **gender-specific attire and adornments** must remain consistent to avoid misidentification.  

3. **Non-modified element deduction**:  
   After excluding all allowed changes, the following **visual details** must be retained:  
   - The **color palette** of the kimono—blue base with multicolored floral motifs—is iconic and must not be replaced with unrelated patterns.  
   - The **position of the obi**—tied at the waist, visible from the back—must remain correct to reflect proper kimono wear.  
   - The **overall composition** of the figure being surrounded by cherry blossoms, even if abstracted, must retain this **spatial relationship** in the chibi versions.  

**Preservation Targets List:**  
- Presence of cherry blossom floral patterns on the kimono  
- Presence of a wide obi with a red-and-yellow bow  
- Hair adorned with a pink floral ornament and tassels  
- Female figure wearing traditional Japanese kimono (cultural identity)  
- Thematic connection to spring via cherry blossoms (in props or surroundings)  
- Blue base color of the kimono (as primary background tone)  
- Position of obi at the waist, tied in back

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

Q1:  
Thinking process: The pink floral ornament in the hair is a unique identifier of the character's traditional styling. It is positioned at the top-right of the head and includes dangling tassels, distinguishing it from generic hair accessories. If removed or replaced, the character loses a key cultural and visual signature. This element is essential for recognition and must be preserved even in chibi form.  
Question: Is there a pink floral hair ornament with dangling tassels positioned at the top-right of the figure’s head?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The obi is a functional and symbolic component of the kimono. Its red-and-yellow patterned bow is a distinct feature, visible from the back. Changing its color scheme or removing it would alter the garment’s authenticity. Even in chibi form, the bow must remain present and identifiable.  
Question: Is there a wide obi tied at the waist with a red-and-yellow patterned bow visible from the back?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The kimono’s base color is dark blue, serving as a contrast to the bright floral patterns. This color choice is integral to the aesthetic balance and cultural representation. Altering it to a non-blue hue would fundamentally change the garment’s identity.  
Question: Does the kimono have a dark blue base color with floral patterns overlaid?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The floral patterns on the kimono are specifically cherry blossom-inspired, featuring pink, red, and white flowers. These are not random designs but culturally significant symbols of spring. Their presence ensures thematic consistency. Even if colors are intensified, the **type of pattern** must remain recognizable.  
Question: Are the floral patterns on the kimono composed of pink, red, and white blossoms resembling cherry blossoms?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The figure is clearly female, wearing a traditional kimono with a formal hairstyle. This gender and cultural identity are central to the image’s meaning. In chibi form, the silhouette and accessories must still convey this identity. Any change to gender expression or cultural markers would break continuity.  
Question: Is the figure depicted as a woman wearing a traditional Japanese kimono?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q6:  
Thinking process: Cherry blossoms are not only in the background but also part of the kimono design and implied in the setting. The thematic link to spring is established through their presence. Even if the background is changed, the **symbolic use of cherry blossoms** must remain in the form of props (branches, petals) in the chibi versions.  
Question: Are cherry blossoms present either in the kimono pattern or as props (e.g., branch, falling petals) in the figure’s immediate vicinity?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The obi is tied at the waist and extends to the back, forming a visible bow. This is a structural detail of traditional kimono wear. In chibi form, the position must remain accurate to preserve realism and logic.  
Question: Is the obi positioned at the waist and tied in a bow at the back?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q8:  
Thinking process: The figure stands in a sideways pose, facing right, with the head slightly turned. While the pose may vary in chibi versions, the **side profile orientation** is a key compositional feature. At least one of the four magnets should retain this view to ensure continuity.  
Question: Is the figure shown in a side profile, facing right, in at least one of the four poses?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1
