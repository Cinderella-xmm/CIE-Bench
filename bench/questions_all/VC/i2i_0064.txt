Description of reference image: The subject is an ornate clock labeled "REVERE BEACH" at the top, with Roman numerals marking the hours on the clock face. The clock is mounted on a tall, decorative metal post set against an open sky with scattered clouds and a view of the ocean in the distance.

Thinking process:  
Analyzing the editing instructions: The instructions specify transforming a cat into a human-like form with accessories like glasses and a remote control, placed in a living room. This scenario is entirely unrelated to this original image's content. Therefore, we need to focus on identifying elements specifically related to the clock and its setting, which should remain unchanged.

Allowed Changes List:  
- The background could potentially be changed if specified, but it's not addressed here.
- The subject (clock) cannot be replaced since the editing instructions do not relate to altering the clock.


Step 2 - Determine the elements that should remain unchanged:

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements include the clock face's design, the text "REVERE BEACH," and the metal post's structure. Functional/logical elements involve the clock's position and orientation relative to the ocean backdrop. Remaining visual elements like the ocean and sky add context but can vary slightly.

Preservation Targets List:  
- "REVERE BEACH" label on the clock.
- Roman numeral clock face design.
- Decorative metal post supporting the clock.
- Position of the clock against the visible ocean and sky.
