Description of reference image: The subject is a child depicted in profile, facing right. The child has short hair and wears a dark outfit with white highlights. A red balloon floats above the child's head, tethered by a string that appears to be held by the child. To the right of the child, there is a heart-shaped balloon painted on the wall. The background consists of a brick wall painted in blue and yellow tones.

Thinking process: First, analyze the instructions that clearly state what can be changed, such as transforming the image into a ceramic mosaic-tile artwork. This implies changes to textures and styles but not necessarily the core elements like shapes or positions. The bold colors and outlines mentioned suggest retaining the color scheme and defining lines while altering the texture.

Allowed Changes List:
- Texture transformation from smooth painting to ceramic mosaic tiles.
- Adjustment of color vibrancy to emphasize boldness.
- Modification of the background style to fit the mosaic theme.

Step 2 - Determine the elements that should remain unchanged

Thinking process:
Core recognition elements: The iconic forms of the child, the round red balloon, and the heart-shaped balloon are key for public recognition. These must retain their shape and position. The scene's logical association between the child and balloons (the child reaching out toward the heart balloon) must also be preserved.

Functional/logical association elements: The relationship between the child and the balloons (the child holding the string of the round balloon and reaching toward the heart balloon) needs to be retained to maintain the narrative logic.

Non-modified element deduction: After excluding allowed changes, details like the child's posture, the specific positioning of the balloons, and the overall composition need to be retained for visual coherence.

Preservation Targets List:
- Shape and position of the child.
- Shape and position of the round red balloon.
- Shape and position of the heart-shaped balloon.
- Child's action of reaching toward the heart balloon.
- Overall composition and relative positions of elements.

Q1: 
Thinking process: The child's shape and position are crucial for maintaining the identity of the subject. Any change would alter the core recognition feature.
Question: Does the edited image retain the child's original shape and position?
Choices: yes, no
A: yes
Weight: 3

Q2: 
Thinking process: The round red balloon is a distinctive element that contributes significantly to the image's identity. Its shape and position must be preserved.
Question: Is the round red balloon retained in its original shape and position?
Choices: yes, no
A: yes
Weight: 3

Q3: 
Thinking process: The heart-shaped balloon is another key element that defines the image. Its shape and position are essential for maintaining the scene's integrity.
Question: Is the heart-shaped balloon retained in its original shape and position?
Choices: yes, no
A: yes
Weight: 3

Q4: 
Thinking process: The child's action of reaching toward the heart balloon is a functional element that ties the narrative together. It must be preserved to maintain logical consistency.
Question: Does the child still appear to be reaching toward the heart-shaped balloon?
Choices: yes, no
A: yes
Weight: 2

Q5: 
Thinking process: The overall composition and relative positions of elements contribute to the image's coherence. Minor details like these help ensure the edited image remains visually consistent.
Question: Are the relative positions of the child, the round red balloon, and the heart-shaped balloon maintained?
Choices: yes, no
A: yes
Weight: 2
