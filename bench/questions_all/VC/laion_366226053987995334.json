      "thinking_process": "The feather-shaped outline with tapered ends is the primary form-defining feature of the earrings. It is the core identity element that distinguishes them from other types of jewelry. If this shape is lost or replaced with a different silhouette (e.g., round or abstract), the object would no longer be recognizable as a feather earring. Therefore, preserving this specific contour is critical for maintaining the original subject’s identity.",
      "question": "Is the overall shape of each earring a symmetrical, elongated feather with pointed tips at both ends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The central oval black stone is a key distinguishing detail. Its placement at the center of the feather and its contrasting dark color against the silver metal make it a focal point. Removing or altering its shape, size, or position would significantly alter the earring’s visual signature. This element is essential for recognition and must be preserved even if stylized in the comic version.",
      "question": "Does each earring contain a centrally located oval black stone set within a metallic bezel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The engraved lines radiating from the central spine simulate feather barbs and are integral to the design’s authenticity. These lines define the texture and pattern of the feather, contributing to its realism and stylistic uniqueness. Altering their direction, density, or presence would change the object’s identity and reduce its recognizability.",
      "question": "Are there fine, parallel engraved lines extending outward from the central spine on both sides of the feather?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The antiqued silver finish gives the earrings a vintage, textured appearance that contributes to their aesthetic identity. While the instruction allows for vibrant colors in the final artwork, the original metallic tone is a key visual attribute. Even in a stylized version, the base color and texture should reflect the original silver tone unless explicitly changed. Retaining this helps maintain visual consistency with the source.",
      "question": "Is the metal of the earrings rendered in a silver tone with a matte or slightly oxidized (antiqued) finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The hook earwire and spherical bead spacer are functional components that define the earring’s construction. They are part of the object’s physical identity and must be present in any representation derived from the original. Even in an anthropomorphic form, the presence of these parts ensures the character is rooted in the original jewelry design.",
      "question": "Does each earring include a curved hook earwire connected via a small spherical bead to the main feather body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The symmetry between the two earrings is a key design feature, ensuring balance and uniformity. This bilateral symmetry is expected in paired jewelry and contributes to visual harmony. Any asymmetry introduced during editing could disrupt the viewer’s perception of the original product. Thus, maintaining identical orientation and structure between the two is important for consistency.",
      "question": "Are the two earrings identical in shape, size, and orientation, mirrored across a vertical axis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
