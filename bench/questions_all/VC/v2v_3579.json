      "thinking_process": "The salmon nigiri is a core component of the sushi arrangement and is identifiable by its distinct orange-pink color, grainy texture, and oval shape. It is a key visual identifier of the sushi type used in the original image. If this feature is lost or altered (e.g., replaced with tuna or changed to red), the sushi would no longer be recognizable as salmon nigiri, undermining the authenticity of the food representation. This is a core identity element, hence weighted at 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the salmon nigiri present with its characteristic orange-pink color and textured surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Maki rolls are another fundamental sushi type in the image, distinguishable by their cylindrical shape, visible rice layer, and internal fillings such as green cucumber or yellow-orange ingredients. Their structural form is essential for identifying the sushi variety. Altering their shape or filling would misrepresent the food. This is a key accessory element in the composition, critical for maintaining the sushi theme, thus weighted at 3 points.",
      "question": "Are maki rolls present with visible cylindrical shapes and green or yellow-orange fillings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Seaweed-wrapped sushi pieces are identifiable by their black outer layer and defined edges, often forming a border around rice or other fillings. This texture and color are unique to nori-wrapped sushi and are essential for distinguishing it from other types. Losing this feature would alter the visual identity of the sushi. This is a core recognition element, so it is weighted at 3 points.",
      "question": "Are there sushi pieces with a black seaweed outer layer and defined edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The white rectangular plate with rounded corners is a key scene element that supports the presentation of the sushi. Its shape, color, and position are consistent with standard serving platters. Changing its color or shape would disrupt the visual coherence of the dining setup. While not a food item, it is a functional and logical element of the scene, so it is weighted at 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the white rectangular plate with rounded corners present and positioned centrally on the dark surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The clear glass of water in the top-left corner is a contextual detail that enhances the realism of the scene. Its transparency, liquid content, and placement are consistent with typical sushi service. Removing or altering it would affect the scene's authenticity. Though minor, it contributes to environmental logic and is therefore weighted at 2 points.",
      "question": "Is a clear glass containing water positioned in the top-left corner of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The dark marbled background with gray veining provides contrast and context for the plate and sushi. Its texture and color are distinctive and contribute to the overall aesthetic. Altering it would change the environment and potentially distract from the main subject. This is a secondary but important environmental detail, so it is weighted at 1 point.",
      "question": "Is the background a dark surface with visible gray veining resembling marble?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The relative positioning of the glass and plate is important for scene logic. The glass is placed slightly off-center to the left, maintaining a natural dining arrangement. Changing this could make the composition feel unnatural. This is a minor but coherent spatial relationship, so it is weighted at 1 point.",
      "question": "Is the glass of water located in the top-left corner, separate from the plate but within the same frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
