      "thinking_process": "The crown is a core identity feature of the knight — its spiked design and placement on the head are critical for recognizing him as royalty. If lost or replaced, the character loses his royal status. It is not mentioned in the instructions to be removed or altered, only the material finish of the armor is changed, so the crown's form must remain.",
      "question": "Is the knight wearing a crown with multiple pointed spires on his head?",

      "thinking_process": "The red cloak with gold trim is a distinctive accessory that contributes to the knight’s noble appearance. Its color and drape are unique identifiers in the original image. Although material might change to bronze, the cloak's presence and shape must remain consistent for visual coherence.",
      "question": "Is there a long red cloak with gold trim draped over the knight’s left shoulder and trailing behind him?",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The longsword held in the knight’s right hand is both a functional and symbolic element. Its position — touching the ground — defines the knight’s stance and readiness. Changing its orientation or removing it would alter the narrative and pose integrity.",
      "question": "Is the knight holding a longsword in his right hand, resting it on the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The central arched gate with crenellated top and two flanking relief sculptures is the architectural centerpiece. The presence of two niches with distinct figures (male and female) is a key compositional feature. Even if scaled, their form and positioning must remain unchanged to preserve the scene’s identity.",
      "question": "Are there two arched niches on either side of the central gate, each containing a relief sculpture of an armored figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The figure atop the battlement holding a red banner is a narrative anchor — it adds depth and context to the scene. Its presence and action (holding flag) are important details. While the banner’s color may be preserved in hue, the figure’s posture and location must remain.",
      "question": "Is there an armored figure standing atop the battlement, holding a red banner with a golden emblem?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The knight’s stance — side profile, facing right, with body angled toward the gate — is crucial for spatial storytelling. This pose establishes his role as guardian. Even in a diorama, this orientation must be preserved to maintain narrative consistency.",
      "question": "Is the knight positioned in a side profile view, facing to the right of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The red banner with a golden emblem is a specific heraldic detail. Its color and emblem are part of the visual signature of the scene. Though the instructions mention adding more flags, they do not specify replacing this one. Thus, the original banner must remain.",
      "question": "Is there a red banner with a golden emblem flying atop the battlement?",
