      "thinking_process": "The vertical stacking of floor levels is a core architectural feature that defines the building as a high-rise structure. Removing or altering this would fundamentally change the subject from a skyscraper to something unrecognizable. Even if transformed into tentacles, the hierarchical layering must remain to preserve logical continuity. Thus, this is a 3-point question as it directly affects identity recognition.",
      "question": "Are there at least eight distinct horizontal levels stacked vertically along the building facade?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The glass railings on each balcony are a defining functional element that separates living space from exterior. Their presence is essential for maintaining the architectural logic of private outdoor spaces. Even if replaced with membrane-like structures, their location and role must be retained. This is a 2-point element because it supports scene coherence and functional plausibility.",
      "question": "Is there a transparent railing structure visible on each balcony, positioned directly outside the windows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The repeating pattern of windows per floor, following the curved contour, is a signature design trait of this building. Altering this rhythm would break the visual identity. While the windows themselves may be replaced, their clustered, arced arrangement must remain to preserve the original aesthetic. This is a 2-point element due to its importance in design recognition.",
      "question": "Are the windows on each floor arranged in a continuous, curved arc along the building’s surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Interior furnishings such as chairs and potted plants visible through windows confirm human occupancy and scale. Their presence grounds the building in reality and provides contextual clues. Even if stylized, they must remain visible to maintain narrative consistency. This is a 1-point detail but necessary for coherence.",
      "question": "Can furniture items (such as chairs or tables) be seen inside the rooms through the windows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The side-on perspective with upward tilt is crucial for conveying the building’s height and curvature. Changing the viewpoint would disrupt spatial understanding and make the edit inconsistent with the original framing. This is a 2-point element because it defines the viewer’s relationship to the structure.",
      "question": "Is the building viewed from a low-angle side perspective, showing its height and curving profile?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The relationship between each window and its adjacent balcony is a functional architectural pairing. This one-to-one correspondence must be preserved to maintain logical consistency. Even if both are transformed, their adjacency must remain. This is a 2-point element due to its structural significance.",
      "question": "Does each window have a corresponding balcony immediately outside it, aligned horizontally?",
