Description of reference image: The subject is a large, arched-top wooden treasure chest positioned centrally on the deck of a sailing ship. The chest has a dark blue-gray weathered wood surface with horizontal metal bands reinforced by brass rivets and corner brackets. A prominent brass ring handle is affixed to the left side, and an ornate lock mechanism is visible on the right front panel. The chest rests on a wooden deck, partially surrounded by thick coiled ropes in natural fiber, one forming a large knot in the foreground. To the right of the chest lies a scattered pile of gold coins, colorful gemstones, small golden pottery vessels, and a cloth sack filled with more treasure. In the background, the wooden planks of the ship’s hull are visible along with vertical rigging ropes and sails catching golden sunlight from a low-angle sun, suggesting dawn or dusk. The lighting casts long shadows and warm highlights across the scene, emphasizing textures such as wood grain, rope fibers, and metallic sheen.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions word by word to determine what elements can be altered. The instruction explicitly states that the image should be transformed into a **mythical treasure map poster**, which implies a fundamental change in format and presentation—this is not a simple overlay but a full recontextualization. However, it also specifies key elements to retain:  
- The **treasure chest** must remain the **central landmark**, highlighted with ink sketches.  
- The **ropes and nautical elements** (e.g., rigging, sails) are to be used as **decorative borders**, meaning their visual presence is preserved but repurposed.  
- The **coins, gems, and pottery** must be included in a **legend**, indicating they must still be visually identifiable.  
- The **compass rose** and **sea monsters** are new additions, not derived from original content.  

Therefore, changes allowed include:  
- Background transformation into a **weathered pirate map texture**.  
- Reformatting the scene into a **poster layout** with symbolic overlays.  
- Use of **ink sketches** for the chest and other elements.  
- Addition of **legend symbols**, **compass rose**, and **sea monster motifs**.  
- Repositioning or stylizing **nautical elements** as decorative borders.  

The core identity of the chest, its materials, and its position relative to key objects (like the rope knot and treasure pile) are implied to be retained due to their central role in the new composition.

Allowed Changes List:
- Background environment: changed from ship deck to weathered pirate map.
- Overall composition: transformed into a poster layout with legend and compass.
- Visual style: shifted to sketch-like ink rendering with ancient typography.
- Placement and function of ropes and sails: repurposed as decorative borders.
- Addition of symbolic elements: sea monsters, compass rose, legend keys.
- Texture of the chest: may be rendered in sketch form, but structure remains.

Thinking process:
Core recognition elements: The **treasure chest** is the focal point and must retain its **distinctive shape** (arched top), **metal bands with rivets**, **brass ring handle**, and **ornate lock**, as these define its identity as a classic pirate chest. These features are iconic in pirate lore and essential for recognition. If lost, the object would no longer be identifiable as a treasure chest. Similarly, the **gold coins and gemstones** must remain visually distinct—especially their **colorful sparkle** and **scattered arrangement**—since they are referenced in the legend and represent the "treasure" element. The **coiled rope knot** in the foreground is a strong visual anchor and must be preserved in form and position to maintain spatial coherence.

Functional/logical association elements: The **chest’s placement on the deck** is logically tied to the **ship setting**, which is preserved via the use of **rigging and sails** in the border. Even though the background changes, the **spatial relationship** between the chest and the ropes must be maintained to preserve narrative logic—i.e., the chest was found *on* a ship, so it must appear connected to nautical elements. The **treasure pile** next to the chest must remain adjacent to reinforce the idea of spilled loot.

Non-modified element deduction: After excluding allowed changes (e.g., background, style, layout), the remaining **physical attributes** of the chest (wood grain, rivet pattern, lock design), the **texture of the rope**, and the **specific shapes and colors of the coins and gems** must be retained because they are not mentioned as changeable and are critical for visual consistency. The **sails and rigging**, while moved to borders, must retain their **shape and structural integrity** to serve as thematic anchors.

Preservation Targets List:
- The arched-top wooden treasure chest with brass-riveted metal bands
- The brass ring handle on the left side of the chest
- The ornate lock mechanism on the right front panel
- The coiled rope knot in the foreground
- The scattered pile of gold coins, gemstones, and pottery vessels near the chest
- The positioning of the chest relative to the rope and treasure pile
- The visible sails and rigging in the background (to be reused in borders)

    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The arched-top wooden treasure chest with brass-riveted metal bands is the central object and core identifier of the scene. Its distinctive dome-shaped lid and horizontal metal straps with evenly spaced rivets are unique to this type of pirate chest. If these structural features are altered or omitted, the object loses its identity as a traditional treasure chest, undermining the entire theme. Therefore, this is a 3-point core recognition element.
    Question: Is the treasure chest depicted with an arched top and horizontal metal bands secured by brass rivets?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The brass ring handle on the left side of the chest is a functional and iconic feature. It is a signature detail that distinguishes this chest from others and provides a visual anchor. Its absence would make the chest look incomplete or generic. Since the instruction specifies the chest as a central landmark, its key components like the handle must be preserved. This is a 3-point core identification element.
    Question: Is there a brass ring handle attached to the left side of the treasure chest?
    Choices: Yes, No

    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The ornate lock mechanism on the right front panel is a detailed and unique feature that adds authenticity and visual interest. It is part of the chest’s functional design and contributes to its aged, valuable appearance. Removing or altering it would reduce the chest’s recognizability and historical feel. As a distinctive accessory, it is essential for maintaining the chest's identity. This is a 2-point important element.

    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The coiled rope knot in the foreground is a key compositional element that grounds the scene and ties it to the ship setting. Its size, shape, and texture are specific and help establish the maritime context. Even if the background changes, the rope must remain intact to maintain continuity with the original scene. This is a 2-point important scene element.

{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The scattered pile of gold coins, gemstones, and pottery vessels directly represents the treasure and is referenced in the legend. Their presence, color variety, and arrangement are crucial for the narrative. Altering or removing them would contradict the instruction to include them in the legend. This is a 2-point key accessory element.
    Question: Are gold coins, colorful gemstones, and small golden pottery vessels visible near the base of the chest?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

}

{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The positioning of the chest relative to the rope and treasure pile establishes spatial logic. The chest must remain adjacent to both the rope knot and the treasure pile to preserve the original scene’s coherence. Changing this layout would disrupt the narrative flow and visual balance. This is a 1-point logical relationship element.
    Question: Is the treasure chest positioned between the coiled rope knot and the pile of coins and gems?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The sails and rigging in the background are critical for establishing the ship setting. Although they will be reused as decorative borders, their original form—vertical ropes and billowing sails—must be preserved to maintain thematic cohesion. Their absence would break the connection to the nautical theme. This is a 2-point important environmental element.
    Question: Are vertical rigging ropes and partially visible sails present in the background behind the chest?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
