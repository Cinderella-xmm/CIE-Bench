Description of reference image: The subject consists of a realistic, three-dimensional sheep and a golden analog clock placed side by side on a neutral beige surface against a plain, uniform beige background. The sheep is standing in profile facing right, with its head slightly turned toward the viewer. It has thick, curly off-white wool covering its body, with visible texture and volume, particularly around the neck and shoulders. Its face is clean-shaven, with dark eyes, a small black nose, and pink inner ears. The hooves are dark gray or black, contrasting with the white legs. The clock is circular, made of polished gold-colored metal with a reflective surface. It features black Arabic numerals from 1 to 12 arranged in a standard clockwise order, with minute markers between them. The hour hand points to 10, the minute hand to 2 (indicating 10:10), and there is a thin second hand pointing at approximately 5. The clock rests on a matching gold base that supports it upright. There are no shadows or lighting effects suggesting depth beyond subtle ambient shading.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions word by word. The instruction states: "Redesign the sheep and clock in the attached image to appear as part of a scene within a snow globe." This indicates that both the **sheep** and the **clock** are to be reimagined — their form, style, and context are explicitly allowed to change. Specifically, they must become **chibi-style 3D models**, which implies a significant transformation in proportions, facial features, and overall design. Additionally, the instruction specifies that the **scene** should now be inside a **snow globe**, resting on a wooden tabletop under warm ambient lighting, with sunlight filtering through and casting glows. This means the **background**, **lighting**, **surface**, and **spatial context** are all being replaced.

The instruction does **not** say to preserve any specific visual traits of the original sheep or clock beyond their identity as those objects. Therefore, changes to their appearance (e.g., size, shape, color, texture) are permitted. However, since the instruction refers to “the sheep” and “the clock,” these identities must still be recognizable — meaning their core functional and symbolic forms must remain intact even if stylized.

Allowed Changes List:
- The form and style of the sheep (e.g., transformed into chibi-style 3D model)
- The form and style of the clock (e.g., transformed into chibi-style 3D model)
- The background (changed from plain beige to warm, neutral-toned room with sunlight)
- The surface (changed from flat beige plane to wooden tabletop)
- The lighting (changed to gentle ambient light with soft glow from sunlight through the globe)
- The spatial context (now enclosed within a snow globe)
- The presence of drifting snowflakes inside the globe
- The posture and interaction (sheep leaning against the clock)

Step 2 - Determine the elements that should remain unchanged

Thinking process:
Core recognition elements: Although the sheep and clock are to be redesigned, their **identity** as a sheep and a clock must be preserved. For the sheep, this includes its **four-legged mammalian structure**, **woolly coat**, and **distinctive facial features** such as ears, eyes, and snout. For the clock, the **circular face**, **numerical markings**, and **hands indicating time** are essential for recognition. These are not arbitrary details but fundamental identifiers. Even in chibi form, the animal must still resemble a sheep, and the object must still functionally resemble a clock.

Functional/logical association elements: The relationship between the two objects — that they are **together in a shared space** — is implied by the original composition. While their positions may shift due to the new scene (e.g., leaning), the fact that they coexist as a pair must be maintained. Also, the **time shown on the clock (10:10)** is a common display setting used in product photography and may be considered a stylistic choice, but unless specified otherwise, it should be preserved as a consistent detail.

Non-modified element deduction: After excluding all allowed changes (style, scene, lighting, etc.), what remains? The **essential identity** of the subjects: the sheep must still be identifiable as a sheep, and the clock as a clock. Their **basic anatomical and structural features** must persist, even if simplified. For example, the sheep cannot become a cat or rabbit; the clock cannot become a thermometer. Furthermore, the **presence of the clock hands and numbers** must be retained, though their style can be altered.

Preservation Targets List:
- The sheep’s four-legged mammalian body structure
- The sheep’s woolly coat texture and distribution
- The sheep’s facial features: ears, eyes, nose, mouth
- The clock’s circular face with numerical markings
- The clock’s hour, minute, and second hands
- The time displayed (10:10)
- The relative positioning of the sheep and clock as adjacent objects

Q1:  
Thinking process: The key recognition feature of the sheep is its **four-legged mammalian body structure**, which distinguishes it from other animals. Even in chibi form, the number of legs and general body plan must remain consistent to maintain identity. Losing this would make it unrecognizable as a sheep. This is a core identity element, hence weight 3.
Question: Does the edited image retain the sheep's four-legged body structure?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The **woolly coat** is a defining characteristic of sheep, especially in this image where the texture is prominent. While the style may be simplified in chibi form, the presence of wool-like covering must be preserved to maintain species recognition. This is a core visual trait, so it carries high weight.
Question: Is the sheep covered in a woolly coat resembling curly fleece?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The **facial features** of the sheep — including ears, eyes, nose, and mouth — are essential for identifying it as a sheep rather than another animal. In chibi style, these may be exaggerated, but they must still be present and recognizable. Their absence would compromise identification.
Question: Are the sheep’s ears, eyes, nose, and mouth clearly visible and positioned in a way consistent with a real sheep?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The **circular face** of the clock is its most basic structural feature. Without it, the object would not be recognizable as a clock. Even if stylized, the round shape must be preserved. This is a core identity element.
Question: Does the clock retain a circular face?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The **numerical markings (1–12)** on the clock face are critical for identifying it as a timepiece. These are not decorative but functional. Even in chibi form, the numbers must be present and arranged in a standard clockwise sequence. Their absence would render the object unrecognizable as a clock.
Question: Are the numbers 1 through 12 present on the clock face in a clockwise arrangement?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The **hour and minute hands** are essential components of an analog clock. They indicate time and are necessary for functional recognition. The second hand is less critical but often included. Since the original shows 10:10, this specific time may be preserved as a stylistic consistency point. The presence of hands is a key functional element.
Question: Are the hour and minute hands visible on the clock face?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The **time displayed (10:10)** is a common default setting in clock imagery and may be considered a stylistic anchor. While not strictly necessary for identity, preserving it maintains continuity with the original image. It is a minor but notable detail.
Question: Does the clock show the time as 10:10?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q8:  
Thinking process: The **relative proximity** of the sheep and clock in the original image suggests a deliberate pairing. Even if repositioned in the snow globe, they must remain together as a unit. This spatial relationship is important for maintaining the original conceptual pairing.
Question: Are the sheep and clock positioned close to each other within the same scene?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2
