### Description of Reference Image:
The subject is a horse being guided onto a trailer by three men. The horse is a rich chestnut color with a sleek coat, wearing a halter. Its posture shows it stepping up the ramp into the trailer. The three men are dressed casually in jeans, jackets, and caps, actively supporting the horse. The background consists of a natural outdoor setting with trees and grass, suggesting a rural environment. The trailer is white with visible windows and a ramp.

### Thinking Process:
The instructions specify transforming the image into a monochrome style with rustic typography for an equestrian event flyer. This means color, some background details, and text styling can be altered. However, the core elements—such as the horse, the action of loading it onto the trailer, and the men assisting—must remain intact to convey the intended message.

### Allowed Changes List:
- Color scheme can be changed to monochrome.
- Background details can be simplified or stylized.
- Typography and text placement can be adjusted for the event details.

### Thinking Process:
Core recognition elements include the horse, its interaction with the trailer, and the men assisting it. These elements define the scene and must be retained. Functional/logical elements, such as the positioning of the men and the horse on the ramp, must also stay consistent to maintain the scene's logic. Remaining elements, like the men's attire and the trailer's structure, contribute to visual coherence and should be kept.

### Preservation Targets List:
- The horse and its interaction with the trailer.
- The men assisting the horse.
- The positioning of the horse on the ramp.
- The trailer's structure and ramp.
- The men's casual attire.
