Description of reference image: The subject consists of five individuals standing side by side on a grassy lawn in front of a stone wall and flowering daffodils. From left to right: the first man wears a gray hooded jacket over a collared shirt, light gray pants, and black-and-white sneakers; he holds a printed pamphlet. The second individual is a young man in a white t-shirt with "NA" printed on it, black skinny jeans, and black Converse sneakers with white laces; he also holds a pamphlet. The third person is an older man wearing a blue and white plaid short-sleeve shirt, dark gray trousers, black dress shoes, and a circular rosette badge pinned to his chest that reads "GRAND CHAMPION." He has a watch on his left wrist and a ring on his left hand. The fourth individual is a young man in a white Adidas t-shirt, gray sweatpants with a star patch on the left thigh, and gray sneakers; he holds a pamphlet. The fifth person wears a bright blue track jacket with white stripes over a graphic tee, dark cargo pants, and black sneakers; he also holds a pamphlet. Behind them, a low stone retaining wall separates the lawn from a flowerbed filled with blooming yellow daffodils. Trees and shrubs are visible behind the wall, along with part of a red-brick building with white-framed windows. The lighting is natural daylight.

Thinking process:  
First, analyze the editing instructions word by word:  
- “Create a comic strip turning these five individuals into daffodil superheroes” → implies full transformation of appearance and context, including costume and posture.  
- “Transform their outfits into vivid floral-themed superhero costumes” → indicates clothing will be replaced entirely.  
- “Each holding a 'Daffodil Power Pass'” → suggests replacement of original pamphlets with new themed items (but retention of the *action* of holding something).  
- “Set them in a lush garden setting” → background may be altered or enhanced, but the presence of daffodils is implied as central.  
- “Include dialogue bubbles with playful banter about daffodil-themed superpowers” → adds new graphical elements not present in original.  
- “Use bold colors and dynamic poses” → implies changes to body language and color palette.  

Thus, **allowed changes** include:  
- Outfits (entirely redesigned into superhero costumes)  
- Held objects (pamphlets → "Daffodil Power Pass")  
- Postures (dynamic poses instead of static standing)  
- Background (can be modified to enhance garden feel, though daffodils likely retained)  
- Color scheme (bold, vibrant hues)  
- Addition of dialogue bubbles and comic-style effects  

However, **not explicitly allowed** to change:  
- The identities of the five individuals (must remain recognizable as the same people)  
- The core physical features that define each person (e.g., facial structure, distinguishing marks like tattoos, accessories such as rings or watches)  
- The scene's core elements if they are referenced in the instruction — specifically, the daffodils are mentioned in both the original scene and the transformation theme, so their presence must be preserved even if stylized.  

Also, while the scene can be transformed into a comic style, the **original spatial relationship** among the figures (side-by-side, roughly aligned) and their **relative positions** should be preserved for continuity unless otherwise stated.

Allowed Changes List:  
- Clothing styles and designs  
- Held items (pamphlets → Power Passes)  
- Body postures and gestures  
- Background details beyond essential flora (e.g., brick building, trees may be altered)  
- Color tone and lighting style  
- Addition of comic elements (dialogue bubbles, motion lines)  
- Facial expressions (though identity must remain intact)

Step 2 – Determine the elements that should remain unchanged

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements:  
The individuals must remain identifiable as themselves. Key identifiers include:  
- Facial features (e.g., beard on the first man, distinctive smile on the third man, hairstyle and facial structure of each)  
- Distinguishing accessories (the rosette badge on the third man’s chest, the watch on his left wrist, the ring on his left hand)  
- Unique tattoos (visible on the third man’s forearm)  
- Hair color and style (e.g., short brown hair on the second and fourth men, receding hairline on the third)  
- Physical proportions and stance (e.g., height differences, posture)  

Functional/logical association elements:  
- The fact that all five individuals are standing together in a group formation — this spatial arrangement supports narrative coherence and should be preserved.  
- Each person is holding a document-like object — the action of holding must be preserved, even if the object changes.  
- The presence of daffodils in the background is critical because the transformation theme revolves around them. Even if stylized, daffodils must remain visually identifiable.  

Non-modified element deduction:  
After excluding allowed changes (clothing, held items, poses), the remaining visual elements that define the original subjects and scene must be retained:  
- Facial features (eyes, nose, mouth, ears, beard)  
- Specific accessories (rosette, watch, ring)  
- Tattoos  
- Hair texture and style  
- Relative positioning of individuals  
- Presence and general appearance of daffodils in the flowerbed  
- Stone wall and its texture (as environmental anchor)  
- Grass lawn surface  

Preservation Targets List:  
- Facial features of each individual  
- The rosette badge on the third man’s chest  
- The watch on the third man’s left wrist  
- The ring on the third man’s left hand  
- The tattoo on the third man’s forearm  
- The daffodils in the flowerbed  
- The relative positions of the five individuals (side-by-side order)  
- The stone wall behind them  
- The action of holding an object in each person’s hand

    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The rosette badge on the third man’s chest is a unique identifier — it contains text ("GRAND CHAMPION") and a distinct black-and-white ribbon design. It is a functional award that distinguishes him from others and is a key visual element tied to his identity in the original image. If removed or altered, it would compromise the recognition of his role and status in the scene. This is a core identification feature.
    Question: Is the rosette badge with the text "GRAND CHAMPION" and black-and-white ribbon design still present on the chest of the third individual?
    Choices: Yes, No

    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The watch on the third man’s left wrist is a specific accessory that contributes to his personal identity and distinguishes him from others. Its presence and position are consistent across typical portraits of this individual. Removing or altering it would affect visual consistency and personal recognition. It is a minor but identifiable detail that supports authenticity.
    Question: Is the wristwatch visible on the left wrist of the third individual?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The ring on the third man’s left hand is a small but distinctive accessory that appears consistently in the original image. It serves as a personal identifier and helps maintain continuity in character representation. While minor, its absence would reduce visual fidelity.
    Question: Is there a ring visible on the ring finger of the left hand of the third individual?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The tattoo on the third man’s forearm is a unique bodily mark that is clearly visible in the original image. It is a personal identifier that cannot be easily replicated or replaced without losing authenticity. Its presence is essential for maintaining the identity of the individual.
    Question: Is the tattoo visible on the forearm of the third individual?
    Choices: Yes, No

{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The daffodils in the flowerbed are central to the thematic transformation described in the instruction (“daffodil superheroes”). Although they may be stylized, their presence and general form (yellow flowers with green stems) must be preserved to maintain the connection between the original scene and the comic concept. Their absence would break the thematic link.
    Question: Are yellow daffodil flowers visible in the flowerbed behind the group?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The relative positioning of the five individuals — standing in a straight line from left to right in the same order — is crucial for maintaining scene coherence. Changing their order or spacing would disrupt the narrative structure and make the edited image inconsistent with the original composition.
    Question: Are the five individuals positioned in the same left-to-right order as in the original image?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The stone wall behind the group serves as a key environmental anchor. Its texture and placement provide depth and context to the scene. While the background may be enhanced, the wall’s presence and basic structure must be preserved to maintain spatial consistency.
    Question: Is the stone retaining wall visible behind the individuals?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
