      "thinking_process": "The **six-wheel configuration** (three axles) is a defining structural feature of this military truck model. Its presence and arrangement are critical for identifying the vehicle as a 6x6 heavy-duty transport. Even when transformed into a crystal sculpture, the number and spacing of wheels must remain identical to maintain functional and visual fidelity. Losing this detail would result in a misrepresentation of the original vehicle’s identity.",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain exactly six wheels arranged in three axles, with the front axle near the cab and two rear axles supporting the cargo body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The **position of the cargo body relative to the cab** is a core spatial relationship that defines the truck’s layout. Moving or resizing this section would distort the vehicle’s identity. Even in crystal form, the cargo body must extend directly behind the cab with the same alignment and length ratio.",
      "question": "Is the cargo body positioned directly behind the cab, maintaining the same horizontal alignment and proportional length as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The **two rectangular windows** on the side of the cargo body are distinctive features that help identify the vehicle’s design. Their placement is fixed and essential for recognition. Replacing or relocating them would alter the truck’s appearance significantly.",
      "question": "Are there two rectangular windows visible on the side of the cargo body, located approximately one-third and two-thirds along its length?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The **front grille** with vertical slats is a signature design element of this truck model. Its presence and central placement on the front are key identifiers. Even in a crystal version, the grille must occupy the same location and maintain its structural outline.",
      "question": "Is the vertical slatted grille present on the front of the vehicle, centered between the headlights and aligned with the hood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The **side mirror** on the driver’s side is a minor but identifiable component. Its presence confirms the vehicle’s operational design. While not critical for overall recognition, its absence would introduce a noticeable inconsistency in the recreation.",
      "question": "Is there a side mirror attached to the driver’s side door, extending outward from the upper portion of the door?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The **ladder** on the side of the cargo body is a functional detail that contributes to the vehicle’s authenticity. Its position and shape are specific to this model. Removing it would reduce the accuracy of the representation.",
      "question": "Is there a horizontal ladder affixed to the lower side of the cargo body, running parallel to the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The **door handle** on the driver’s side is a small but consistent feature across the truck’s design. Its retention ensures attention to detail and maintains the vehicle’s recognizable form.",
      "question": "Is there a silver-colored door handle visible on the driver’s side door, positioned midway down the door?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
