Description of reference image: The image features two clear glass cups filled with a steaming hot beverage, likely tea or coffee, placed on a wooden table. The steam rising from both drinks is prominent, indicating their warmth. The background is soft and dim, with light coming from the right side, possibly from a window, and some out-of-focus elements suggesting an indoor setting. The wooden surface under the cups has distinct grain patterns, adding texture to the scene.

### Step 1 - Allowed Changes List:
Thinking process: The instructions specify replacing the desk and background with an outdoor café table in front of a snowy cabin. Therefore, the existing desk and background are changeable. Since the instruction aims to create a warm winter atmosphere, the lighting and mood can also be adjusted accordingly. However, the cups, beverages, and steam are central to the image's purpose and should not be altered.

Allowed Changes List:
Specific element 1 that allows for changes: Desk and background (to be replaced with an outdoor café table and snowy cabin backdrop).
Specific element 2 that allows for changes: Lighting to enhance the warm winter atmosphere.

### Step 2 - Preservation Targets List:
Thinking process:
- **Core recognition elements**: The cups, beverages, and steam are crucial identifiers of the image’s focus on a hot drink moment. Changing these would compromise the image's essence.
- **Functional/logical association elements**: The wooden surface interacting with the cups provides logical support. These should remain consistent with the new setting.
- **Remaining elements for visual coherence**: The steam's direction and shape are minor yet cohesive details that should be retained.

Preservation Targets List:
(Element 1 that should be maintained): The shape and transparency of the glass cups.
(Element 2 that should be maintained): The appearance and color of the beverages inside the cups.
(Element 3 that should be maintained): The visible steam rising from the beverages.
(Element 4 that should be maintained): The interaction between the cups and the wooden surface.
(Element 5 that should be maintained): The overall warmth conveyed by the beverages and steam.
