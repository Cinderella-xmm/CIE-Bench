      "thinking_process": "The two cylindrical corner towers are the most distinctive architectural features of the castle, defining its silhouette and providing immediate recognition. Their presence, shape, and placement at the far left and right ends of the structure are critical for identifying the castle. If they are removed or replaced, the structure loses its unique identity. Therefore, their retention is essential.",
      "question": "Are the two cylindrical corner towers still present at the left and right ends of the castle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The central square turrets with pointed finials are signature vertical elements that rise above the main roofline and contribute to the Gothic aesthetic. They are located symmetrically on either side of the central archway and serve as key identifiers. Removing or altering them would fundamentally change the castle’s appearance and reduce its recognizability.",
      "question": "Do the two central square turrets with pointed finials remain atop the central section of the castle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The large central arched entranceway is the focal point of the castle’s facade and defines its primary function as a gateway. Its size, shape, and central position are crucial for maintaining the architectural balance and identity. Altering or removing it would disrupt the core symmetry and functional logic of the structure.",
      "question": "Is the large central arched entranceway still present and centrally aligned with the pathway?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The symmetrical arrangement of arched windows and openings across the facade contributes to the castle’s balanced design. These include the tall narrow windows above the entrance and the paired arched openings on either side. Their presence ensures the architectural integrity and visual harmony of the structure. Changing their number or placement would break the symmetry and weaken recognition.",
      "question": "Are the arched windows and openings arranged symmetrically across the front facade of the castle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The stone construction material, characterized by dark gray and reddish-brown hues, is a key visual attribute of the castle. It reflects historical authenticity and distinguishes it from other structures. While texture might be enhanced in a magical rendering, the base material and color palette must remain consistent to preserve realism and identity.",
      "question": "Is the castle still constructed from dark gray and reddish-brown stone blocks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The absence of a roof and the visible interior framework of the upper floors indicate the castle’s ruined state. This is a defining characteristic of the current condition of the structure. Replacing or covering it with a roof would contradict the original state and misrepresent the subject.",
      "question": "Is the upper portion of the castle still open to the sky, revealing the lack of a roof and internal framework?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The central alignment of the main gate with the gravel pathway creates a strong compositional axis. This spatial relationship is essential for guiding the viewer’s eye and maintaining the intended perspective. Disrupting this alignment would distort the scene’s logic and visual flow.",
      "question": "Does the central arched entranceway align directly with the center of the gravel pathway leading toward it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
