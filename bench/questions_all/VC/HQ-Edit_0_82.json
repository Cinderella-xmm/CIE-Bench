      "thinking_process": "The tai chi stance is the core action being depicted and defines the subject’s purpose in the image. The specific configuration — right leg forward in lunge, left leg raised, hands positioned in precise gestures — is essential to identifying the practice. If this pose is altered, the image loses its meaning as a tai chi depiction. This is a 3-point element because it is both functionally and culturally significant.",
      "question": "Is the elderly man in a tai chi stance with his right leg bent in a lunge, left leg raised behind him, right hand forming an \"ok\" gesture near his face, and left hand resting at his waist?",

      "thinking_process": "The bare feet are a key detail indicating simplicity, grounding, and connection to nature — central to Zen philosophy. They also distinguish the figure from someone wearing shoes. Removing or covering them would change the subject’s identity and context. Though the style may shift, the presence of bare feet must be retained. This is a 2-point element due to its symbolic and visual importance.",
      "question": "Are the man’s feet bare, with the right foot flat on the tile and the left foot raised behind him?",

      "thinking_process": "The light blue traditional robe is a defining feature of the subject’s attire and cultural identity. Its flowing sleeves and layered fabric folds contribute to the sense of movement and grace. Even if rendered in line-art or watercolor, the shape and color must remain identifiable. Changing it to modern clothing would break the authenticity. This is a 2-point element due to its role in character identification.",
      "question": "Does the man wear a light blue traditional robe with wide sleeves and visible fabric folds?",

      "thinking_process": "The cherry blossom trees are not just scenery but iconic symbols of transience and beauty in Zen culture. Their curved trunks and pink blossoms are distinctive visual markers in the background. Even if stylized, their presence and general form must be preserved to maintain the thematic integrity. This is a 2-point element as it defines the environmental context.",
      "question": "Are there cherry blossom trees with pink flowers and curved dark trunks lining a path in the background?",

      "thinking_process": "The tiled platform provides a clear ground plane and contrasts with the natural environment. Its square tiles and visible grout lines are specific geometric details that anchor the figure spatially. Altering or removing them would disrupt the composition and make the scene feel ungrounded. This is a 1-point element as it is a structural detail supporting coherence.",
      "question": "Is the man standing on a surface composed of large square tiles with visible grout lines?",

      "thinking_process": "The long white beard and hair are key features identifying the man as elderly and wise, aligning with the Zen master archetype. They are part of his facial identity and cannot be removed without changing who he is. This is a 2-point element due to its role in character recognition.",

This compositional relationship is crucial for visual storytelling. Even if simplified, the relative positioning must remain consistent. This is a 2-point element as it governs the overall scene logic.",
      "question": "Is the man positioned in the foreground, facing toward the right side of the image, with a curved path receding into mist behind him and a bright light source in the upper-right corner?",
