      "thinking_process": "The two corner towers with domed roofs and weather vanes are the most distinctive architectural features of the White Tower. Their presence and position define the structure’s identity. If either tower is removed or significantly altered in shape, the building would no longer be recognizable as the White Tower. The cross-shaped weather vane on the right tower is also a key detail, serving as a unique identifier. Therefore, preserving both towers and their crowns is essential for identity retention, making this a 3-point question.",
      "question": "Are both corner towers with domed roofs and weather vanes present and positioned at the upper corners of the structure?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The crenellated parapet is a defining feature of medieval fortifications and a hallmark of the White Tower. It runs continuously along the top edge and contributes to the building’s silhouette. Removing or smoothing it would fundamentally alter the structure’s appearance and historical character. Since it is not mentioned for removal in the instructions, it must be preserved. This is a core architectural element critical for recognition, hence weighted at 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the crenellated parapet running along the top edge of the tower intact and continuous?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The symmetrical arrangement of arched windows—particularly the triplet groups on the upper level and the single arched windows below—is a unique feature of the White Tower’s façade. These windows follow a precise pattern that distinguishes it from other towers. Altering their number, shape, or spacing would compromise the building’s identity. While the instruction allows stylization, the fundamental layout must remain. This is a key visual identifier, thus worth 3 points.",
      "question": "Are the arched windows arranged symmetrically across the façade, including the triplet groupings above the main level?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The central arched entrance with its wooden drawbridge is a functional and visual focal point. Even though the instruction allows replacement with model knights, the **location and form** of the entrance must remain to preserve logical continuity. The drawbridge’s crisscross bracing and position directly below the central arch are distinctive details. Changing its location or removing it entirely would disrupt the structure’s recognizability. This is a major structural feature, so it warrants 2 points.",
      "question": "Is there a central arched entrance at ground level, directly beneath the central section of the façade, with a wooden drawbridge structure extending forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The horizontal banding of light and dark stone creates a rhythmic visual pattern unique to the White Tower’s construction. This masonry technique is historically accurate and visually distinctive. While the instruction allows material changes (e.g., faux stone), the **alternating pattern** should be preserved to retain authenticity and visual coherence. Losing this pattern would make the tower appear generic. It is a significant architectural detail, so assigned 2 points.",
      "question": "Are there horizontal bands of alternating light and dark stone visible across the exterior walls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The overall rectangular massing of the tower, with its tall, block-like form and two projecting towers, defines its silhouette. Any drastic alteration in proportions (e.g., squaring off corners or changing height ratio) would misrepresent the structure. While stylization is allowed, the basic shape must remain. This is a foundational geometric feature, important for recognition, hence 2 points.",
      "question": "Does the tower maintain a tall, rectangular mass with two prominent corner towers projecting outward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The wooden drawbridge’s crisscross lattice pattern is a specific detail that adds realism and historical accuracy. Although the instruction allows replacement with model knights, the **structure’s form and placement** should be preserved to maintain functional logic. The diagonal bracing is a minor but identifiable feature. Its loss would reduce visual fidelity, though not identity. Thus, it is a detail-level element, worth 1 point.",
      "question": "Is the wooden drawbridge constructed with a crisscross lattice pattern of beams?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
