      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "The butterfly's four-winged structure with two large upper wings and two smaller lower wings is its core identifying feature. Changing this would result in a different insect or abstract shape, making it unrecognizable as the original butterfly design. The presence of distinct upper and lower wings with specific proportions is essential for identity, hence this is a 3-point question.",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the butterfly’s four-winged structure with two large upper wings and two smaller lower wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The symmetrical layout of the wings is a defining characteristic of the original butterfly ornament. Asymmetry would disrupt the visual balance and make it visually inconsistent with the original. Since the instruction requires maintaining the butterfly shape, symmetry must be preserved as a core aspect of that shape.",
      "question": "Is the butterfly depicted with symmetrical wings on both sides?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The central body connects the wings and houses the head with the hanging loop. This structural component is essential for the butterfly’s anatomical coherence. Even as a plush toy, the body must remain present to maintain the butterfly’s form and functionality as an ornament.",
      "question": "Is there a visible central body connecting the wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The hanging loop at the top of the head is a functional element that defines the object as a hanging ornament. Although the material may change, the instruction implies maintaining its ornamental use, so the loop must remain in position and function. Its absence would alter the object’s intended use.",
      "question": "Is there a loop or attachment point at the top of the butterfly’s head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The butterfly is shown in a flat, open-winged posture in the original image. This pose is essential for displaying the full wing design and is consistent with the instruction to place it on a cushion for display. Altering the pose (e.g., folded wings) would contradict the intended presentation and reduce visual fidelity.",
      "question": "Is the butterfly positioned with wings fully spread in a flat, horizontal orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The relative proportions of the wings to the body define the butterfly’s aesthetic balance. Enlarging or shrinking any part disproportionately would distort the original design. While the instruction allows material change, proportion is tied to shape preservation, so it must remain consistent.",
      "question": "Are the wings proportionally larger than the body, matching the original scale?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The upper wings have a distinct pointed tip and curved edge, forming a signature silhouette. This shape is unique to the butterfly’s design and distinguishes it from other insects. Losing this contour would make the butterfly unrecognizable.",
      "question": "Do the upper wings have a pointed tip and curved outer edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "thinking_process": "The lower wings are smaller and rounded compared to the upper ones, contributing to the overall balance. This distinction in wing size is a minor but identifiable detail that helps confirm the butterfly’s correct morphology. It is not core but important for visual accuracy.",
      "question": "Are the lower wings visibly smaller and more rounded than the upper wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
