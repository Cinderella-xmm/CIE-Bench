If these are altered (e.g., flattened, streamlined), it would no longer resemble a standard poodle. This is a core recognition element, making it essential to preserve. Losing this would result in misidentification of the subject.",

It is central to the \"couture dress\" description and must be preserved in form, even if stylized. Removing or altering the layers would violate the intended visual identity.",
