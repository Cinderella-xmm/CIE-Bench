      "thinking_process": "The long, curly white beard is the most iconic feature of Santa Claus and is central to his visual identity. Its texture, volume, and placement are distinctive and serve as the primary identifier of the character. Removing or altering it would fundamentally change who the figure is, even if dressed differently. Thus, preserving the exact form and flow of the beard is essential for maintaining recognition. This is a core identity element and therefore carries maximum weight.",
      "question": "Is the long, curly, voluminous white beard present and extending down the front of the chest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The thin-rimmed glasses are a specific detail of the subject’s face and contribute to his individuality. While not universal to all depictions of Santa, they are a key feature of this particular portrayal. Changing them would alter the likeness and make the figure unrecognizable as the same person. As a unique facial accessory, it is a high-importance retention point.",
      "question": "Are the thin-rimmed glasses worn on the face, positioned over the eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The extended right arm with an open palm is a functional gesture that conveys welcome and interaction. It is crucial to the composition and narrative of the image. Although the glove will be replaced, the hand's posture, finger spread, and direction must remain identical to preserve the original action. This gesture is not mentioned for change and is therefore a logical preservation target.",
      "question": "Is the right arm extended outward with the palm facing upward and fingers slightly spread?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The facial expression—specifically the smiling mouth and crinkled eyes—conveys warmth and friendliness, which are core traits associated with Santa. This expression is not referenced in the editing instruction, so it must remain unchanged. Altering it would shift the emotional tone of the image and break continuity with the original subject.",
      "question": "Is the mouth curved upward in a smile and the eyes slightly crinkled at the corners?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The head orientation—slightly turned toward the viewer—establishes eye contact and engagement. This spatial positioning is essential for maintaining the subject’s presence and connection with the audience. Since the instruction does not mention altering posture or angle, this must be preserved to maintain consistency in the figure’s stance.",
      "question": "Is the head turned slightly to the left side of the frame, facing forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The skin tone and facial features (such as nose shape, cheekbones, and eyebrows) define the individual’s physical identity. These are not mentioned in the editing instruction, so they must remain intact. Any alteration would result in a different person being portrayed, undermining the continuity of the subject.",
      "question": "Are the facial features including the nose, eyebrows, and cheeks clearly visible and consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The fingers' position—spread apart and relaxed—is part of the overall gesture and contributes to the naturalness of the pose. Though the gloves will be replaced, the underlying hand shape and spacing must remain unchanged to preserve the gesture’s authenticity. This is a minor but important detail that supports visual coherence.",
      "question": "Are the fingers of the right hand splayed outward with natural spacing between them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
