**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject consists of a pair of ceramic cheetah bookends, each sculpted in a seated pose with the body facing forward and the head turned slightly to the side. The cheetahs are detailed with tan fur and black spots distributed across their bodies, including on the legs, torso, tail, and face. Their eyes are dark and expressive, and their ears are upright and pointed. Each cheetah is mounted on a two-tiered base: the upper tier is glossy black, and the lower tier is metallic bronze-colored with stepped edges. Between the bookends, three vertical rectangular panels stand upright—two thinner ones flanking a central wider one—featuring a botanical print of green palm fronds on a white background with dark outlines. The entire composition is symmetrically arranged against a plain white backdrop, with soft reflections visible beneath the objects.

Thinking process:  
The editing instructions explicitly state that the **cheetah figures should be transformed into sleek, gold-finished perfume bottles**, maintaining their **poses**. This indicates that while the material and function of the cheetahs will change (from ceramic animal sculptures to perfume bottles), their **posture, orientation, and spatial arrangement** must remain consistent. The instruction also specifies replacing the **botanical center with a translucent, green-tinted glass façade cascading downwards**, which means the **central decorative panel structure** is allowed to change in form and material but not necessarily in position or overall layout. Additionally, the instruction mandates adding **minimalist branding along the bases** using a **chic serif font titled "Savanna Essence"**, implying that the **bases’ structure and position** are preserved but their surface details may be modified.

Allowed Changes List:  
- The material and form of the cheetah figures (transformed into gold-finished perfume bottles)  
- The central botanical panels (replaced with a translucent green-tinted cascading glass façade)  
- The surface details of the bases (addition of "Savanna Essence" branding in a serif font)  
- The functional purpose of the object (from bookends to perfume display)  
- The texture and color of the cheetahs (changed from spotted ceramic to solid gold finish)  
- The visual content of the central divider (botanical pattern replaced with glass effect)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements must be preserved if they are essential to identifying the original subject or its iconic form. In this case, although the cheetahs are being reimagined as perfume bottles, the **seated posture** and **overall silhouette** of the animals are specified to be maintained. Therefore, the **orientation (facing forward, head turned)**, **body shape**, and **relative positioning** (one on left, one on right) are critical for preserving the visual identity of the original design. These are not merely aesthetic choices but structural anchors that define the symmetry and balance of the piece.

Functional/logical association elements include the **spatial relationship between the cheetahs and the central divider**, as well as the **positioning of the bases**. Since the original function was to support books, the **symmetrical framing role** of the cheetahs around the central element is logically preserved in the new context as a perfume display—suggesting that the **layout and alignment** must stay intact for coherence.

Non-modified elements are derived by exclusion: any detail not mentioned in the allowed changes list must be retained unless it contradicts the transformation. For example, the **shape of the base tiers**, **step-like structure**, and **placement beneath each figure** are not mentioned as changed, so they must be preserved. Similarly, the **three-panel configuration** of the central divider is implied to be preserved in number and spacing, even though its content changes.

Preservation Targets List:  
- The seated pose of the cheetahs (including body angle, leg placement, and tail curve)  
- The orientation of the cheetah heads (turned slightly to the side)  
- The symmetrical arrangement of the two cheetahs (left and right)  
- The two-tiered base structure (black upper tier, bronze lower tier with stepped edges)  
- The three-panel configuration of the central divider (number and vertical alignment)  
- The relative height and spacing between the cheetahs and the central panels

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The seated pose of the cheetahs—including the bent hind legs, tucked tail, and upright front paws—is the defining structural feature that gives them their recognizable form. Even when transformed into perfume bottles, maintaining this pose ensures continuity in identity. This posture is a core recognition element because it distinguishes the sculpture from other animal forms or abstract shapes. Loss of this pose would make the transformation unrecognizable as a derivation of the original.
    Question: Are the cheetahs in a seated position with bent hind legs, tucked tails, and upright front paws?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The direction of the cheetah heads—turned slightly to the side—is a key facial orientation that contributes to the lifelike expression and balanced symmetry of the pair. This specific head turn is not arbitrary; it creates a dynamic yet composed look. Changing this would disrupt the intended aesthetic and reduce the visual coherence of the design. It is an important scene-related element that supports the overall composition.
    Question: Is the head of each cheetah turned slightly to the side, away from the central divider?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The two-tiered base structure—comprising a glossy black upper tier and a bronze-colored stepped lower tier—is a distinctive architectural feature of the original bookends. Its preservation ensures that the transformed object retains its foundational form. Altering the base’s tiered shape or material would fundamentally change the object’s profile and undermine its original design language.
    Question: Does each cheetah rest on a two-tiered base with a black upper section and a bronze-colored stepped lower section?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The symmetrical placement of the cheetahs—one on the left and one on the right—defines the balanced composition of the piece. This mirrored arrangement is essential to the design’s visual harmony and functional intent (framing the central divider). Any asymmetry would break the intended aesthetic and logical structure of the display.
    Question: Are the cheetah figures positioned symmetrically, one on the left and one on the right, equidistant from the center?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The presence of three vertical panels between the cheetahs—two narrow outer ones and one wider central one—is a structural component that defines the spatial layout. While their content is to be replaced, their number and alignment are critical to maintaining the original format. Removing or altering the count would violate the core framework of the design.
    Question: Are there exactly three vertical panels positioned between the cheetahs, with two narrower ones flanking a wider central one?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The tail of each cheetah curves gently behind the body and rests on the base, forming a distinct arc. This tail position is part of the animal’s anatomical accuracy and contributes to the naturalistic appearance. Preserving this curve maintains the fidelity of the animal's form, even as it transforms into a bottle. It is a minor but identifiable detail that supports overall consistency.
    Question: Does the tail of each cheetah curve upward and rest on the base behind the body?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
