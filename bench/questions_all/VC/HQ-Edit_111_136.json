      "thinking_process": "The dynamic pose of the dancer—specifically the lifted left leg with bent knee, grounded right foot, and arms raised in expressive motion—is the core visual identifier of the subject’s action in the original image. This pose is not merely decorative but defines the entire narrative of the scene. Even if the subject becomes a Greek goddess, the same gesture must be preserved to maintain continuity of movement and intent. Losing this pose would fundamentally alter the image’s identity and purpose, making it unrecognizable as a transformation of the original. Thus, it is a core identity feature.",
      "question": "Is the dancer depicted with her left leg lifted and bent at the knee, while her right foot remains planted on the ground?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The dancer’s position on the right side of the frame, facing left, is a critical compositional element that establishes visual balance and directional flow. This positioning guides the viewer’s eye across the image and aligns with the movement of the herd in the background. Changing this placement would disrupt the spatial logic and break the connection between the subject and the environment. Although the instruction allows environmental changes, the subject’s location relative to the frame is a foundational layout element that should be preserved for coherence.",
      "question": "Is the dancer positioned on the right side of the image, facing toward the left side of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The flowing skirt, fanned out due to motion, is a key detail that emphasizes the dynamism of the dance. Its shape and direction indicate forward momentum and are integral to the sense of movement. Even if the clothing is changed to a chiton, the silhouette and flow of the garment must reflect similar motion to maintain continuity. Without this dynamic shape, the sense of dance is lost, and the transformation becomes disconnected from the original action.",
      "question": "Does the skirt of the dancer appear to be flared outward and upward due to motion, suggesting a spinning or leaping movement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The depth layering—dancer in foreground, herd in midground, trees in background—is essential to the image’s spatial realism. This arrangement creates a sense of vastness and context. While the content of each layer may change (e.g., herd replaced with mythical beasts), the hierarchical placement must remain consistent to preserve the original composition. Altering this layering would result in a disoriented or flattened image, undermining the original’s visual impact.",
      "question": "Is the dancer positioned in the foreground, with a group of animals in the midground and trees in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The lighting direction—from the right side of the image, casting shadows to the left—creates a strong contrast and defines the time of day (sunset). This lighting enhances the drama and mood of the scene. Even if the sky is reimagined in Greek pottery style, the direction of light must remain consistent to preserve the visual tone and emotional resonance of the original. Changing the light source would shift the entire atmosphere and potentially disconnect the new scene from the original’s aesthetic.",
      "question": "Is the light source coming from the right side of the image, illuminating the dancer and casting shadows to the left?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
