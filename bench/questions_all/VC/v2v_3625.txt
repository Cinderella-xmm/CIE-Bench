### Step 1: Analyze the Original Image and Editing Instructions

**Description of Reference Image:**  
The image shows a hand placing a red pin onto a map. The map has various colored lines representing roads and geographical features. Four other pins—blue, yellow, green, and another red—are already placed on the map, connected by a green thread forming a route. The hand is wearing a beige sweater sleeve, and the map is laid flat on a wooden surface.

**Thinking Process:**  
The editing instructions specify transforming the map and pins into a ceramic mosaic tile artwork with bold patterns and rich textures. This means the map's form, the pins, and their connections can be altered in terms of material and texture. However, the core concept of the map and the pins marking locations/routes should remain intact.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
1. Material transformation of the map and pins into ceramic mosaic tiles.
2. Texture adjustment to bold patterns and rich textures.
3. Color variations to fit the mosaic theme while retaining the original color essence.

### Step 2: Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged

**Thinking Process:**  
- **Core Recognition Elements:** The map's function as a navigational tool and the pins marking specific locations/routes are crucial. Losing these would make the image unrecognizable as a travel planning scene.
- **Functional/Logical Association Elements:** The hand placing the pin and the connection between pins via the thread must be logically consistent. The hand's action supports the narrative of planning a journey.
- **Remaining Elements:** The wooden surface and the beige sweater sleeve provide context but are secondary. They should be retained for visual coherence unless explicitly stated otherwise.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
1. The map's function as a navigational tool.
2. The pins marking specific locations/routes.
3. The hand placing the pin.
4. The connection between pins via the thread.

### Step 3: Generate Yes/No Questions

**Q1:**  
Thinking process: The map's function as a navigational tool is a core recognition feature. Without this, the image loses its primary purpose.  
Question: Does the edited image retain the representation of a navigational tool (map)?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3

**Q2:**  
Thinking process: The pins marking locations/routes are essential for the map's functionality. Their presence ensures the image conveys the intended message.  
Question: Are there identifiable markers (pins) indicating specific locations/routes on the map?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3

**Q3:**  
Thinking process: The hand placing the pin is a functional element that supports the narrative of planning a journey. Its presence maintains the logical flow.  
Question: Is there a visible hand interacting with the map, specifically placing a marker?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2

**Q4:**  
Thinking process: The connection between pins via the thread is a logical association that represents a planned route. Retaining this helps maintain the scene's coherence.  
Question: Are the markers (pins) visibly connected, suggesting a planned route?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2

**Q5:**  
Thinking process: The wooden surface and the beige sweater sleeve provide context and support the scene's realism. While secondary, they contribute to visual consistency.  
Question: Does the edited image retain the wooden surface and the beige sweater sleeve as part of the scene?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1

These questions focus on retaining the core recognition features, functional/logical associations, and secondary details necessary for visual coherence.
