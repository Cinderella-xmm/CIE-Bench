**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a young woman wearing a traditional red Chinese qipao (cheongsam), positioned frontally with a slight tilt to her right, facing the viewer with a warm smile. Her dark hair is styled in an elegant updo with loose strands framing her face. She wears long, golden tassel earrings that hang vertically from her ears. The qipao features short sleeves, a high mandarin collar, and intricate floral embroidery in beige and gold tones, depicting peony-like flowers and leaves across the fabric. The garment has a blue decorative trim along the collar, sleeve edges, and central clasp area, where a series of blue frog closures (buttons) are visible, connected by fabric loops. The texture of the fabric appears smooth and satin-like, reflecting light subtly. The background is softly blurred, showing neutral-toned walls with a framed artwork on the right side, suggesting an indoor setting with soft ambient lighting.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction specifies:  
- Transforming the outfit into **cartoon style** with **exaggerated floral embroidery** and **vibrant colors** → this allows modification of artistic style, color saturation, and proportion of design elements.  
- Styling the **clasp as intricate jade patterns** → implies the **form and material appearance** of the clasp can be changed, but not necessarily its **position or function**.  
- Inserting **detachable writing sections on vibrant silk backgrounds with gold foil borders** → this introduces **new elements** not present in the original image, indicating the **background and layout** may be altered significantly.  

However, the instruction does **not** mention changing the **identity of the subject**, **her facial features**, **hair style**, or **overall posture**, nor does it allow removal of the **qipao’s core structure**. It also does not specify altering the **original composition** such as the **angle, pose, or facial expression**. Therefore, while **style and background** are permitted to change, **core identity features** must remain intact.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
- Artistic style of the outfit (e.g., cartoon rendering)  
- Color intensity and vibrancy of the embroidery and fabric  
- Design of the clasp (to resemble jade patterns)  
- Background elements (addition of writing sections, silk textures, gold foil borders)  
- Proportion and exaggeration of floral patterns on the qipao  
- Overall visual tone and medium (transition to postcard art format)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
Core recognition elements:  
- The **subject’s face**—especially her **smiling expression**, **eye shape**, **eyebrow arch**, **lips**, and **skin tone**—are critical for identity preservation. Any distortion would alter her recognizability.  
- The **qipao’s silhouette**—including the **high mandarin collar**, **short sleeves**, **side slits**, and **frog closure system**—is essential for identifying the garment type. Even if stylized, its **functional form** must remain recognizable.  
- The **hair style**—an updo with loose strands—is a key part of the character’s presentation and should not be replaced with a completely different hairstyle unless explicitly allowed.  
- The **golden tassel earrings**—their **shape**, **length**, and **placement**—are distinctive accessories that contribute to the overall aesthetic and should be preserved in form even if rendered stylistically.  
- The **position and orientation** of the subject—facing forward with a slight turn—must remain consistent to maintain compositional coherence.  

Functional/logical association elements:  
- The **frog closures** serve both decorative and functional roles; their placement along the center front must be retained to preserve the qipao’s structural logic.  
- The **relationship between the subject and her clothing**—i.e., she is wearing the qipao—must remain unchanged. The garment must still be worn, not floating or detached.  

Non-modified element deduction:  
After excluding allowed changes (artistic style, color, background, clasp design), the remaining **visual details** that define the original subject must be preserved. These include:  
- Facial features (eyes, nose, mouth, cheeks)  
- Hair texture and arrangement  
- Earring design and position  
- Qipao’s cut and seam lines  
- Embroidery pattern location (though not its size or detail)  

These are not explicitly allowed to change, so they must be retained under visual coherence principles.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
- The woman’s facial features (eyes, eyebrows, lips, smile, cheekbones)  
- Her hairstyle (updo with loose strands framing the face)  
- The golden tassel earrings (shape, length, hanging position)  
- The red qipao with high mandarin collar and short sleeves  
- The presence and positioning of the frog closures along the center front  
- The general body posture (standing upright, hand near chest)  
- The overall frontal orientation and slight head tilt

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

Q1:  
Thinking process: The woman's eyes are a core recognition feature—specifically, the almond shape, upward-sweeping eyeliner, and natural iris color—are essential for identifying her identity. Altering these would make her unrecognizable. This is a 3-point element because facial features are primary identifiers in portrait imagery.  
Question: Are the woman’s eyes clearly visible with almond-shaped pupils and defined eyeliner?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The golden tassel earrings are unique accessories that define the character’s aesthetic. Their presence, shape (tassel), and hanging position from the earlobe are distinct. Removing or replacing them would disrupt the original visual identity. This is a 2-point element due to its importance as a key accessory.  
Question: Do the earrings consist of long, golden tassels hanging from the earlobes?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The high mandarin collar is a defining architectural feature of the qipao. Its shape, blue trim, and connection to the neck are essential for identifying the garment type. Changing it would alter the garment’s classification. This is a 3-point element as it is a core identity feature of the traditional attire.  
Question: Is there a high-standing mandarin collar with blue trim around the neck?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The frog closures (blue fabric buttons) are functional and iconic to the qipao. Their position along the center front and their connection via fabric loops are necessary for recognizing the garment’s structure. Even if stylized, their placement must remain consistent. This is a 2-point element due to its functional and symbolic role.  
Question: Are there blue frog closures running vertically down the center front of the qipao?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The woman’s hairstyle—an updo with loose strands framing the face—is a specific grooming detail that contributes to her identity. A completely different hairstyle would change her appearance fundamentally. This is a 2-point element as it supports identity and aesthetic continuity.  
Question: Is the hair styled in an updo with two loose strands falling on either side of the face?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The red color of the qipao is a dominant visual feature and cultural identifier. While the instruction allows vibrant colors, the base color must remain red to preserve the garment’s traditional significance. This is a 2-point element as it defines the garment’s cultural context.  
Question: Is the main fabric of the qipao red in color?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The woman’s hand position—held gently near the chest—contributes to the pose and emotional expression. Changing it would alter the posture and potentially the mood. This is a 1-point element as it is a minor detail affecting coherence.  
Question: Is the woman’s right hand positioned near her chest, fingers slightly curled?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q8:  
Thinking process: The floral embroidery pattern is located across the chest and sleeves. While the instruction allows exaggeration, the presence of floral motifs in those areas must remain to maintain visual consistency. This is a 1-point element as it is a decorative detail that supports authenticity.  
Question: Are there embroidered floral patterns visible on the chest and upper sleeves of the qipao?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1
