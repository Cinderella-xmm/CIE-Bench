**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a dark glass wine bottle with a sleek, classic shape, positioned upright against a plain white background. The bottle has a dark brown capsule covering the neck, secured with a thin, natural-colored twine tied in a simple knot just below the capsule. The label is a minimalist, light gray rectangle centered on the bottle’s body. At the top center of the label is a small, stylized icon of a scarecrow wearing a straw hat, rendered in warm earth tones (brown and beige). Below the icon, the word "SCARECROW" is printed in uppercase, sans-serif font in a dark gray color. Beneath the brand name, the vintage year "2017" is displayed in smaller, lighter text. The bottle contains a dark red liquid, visible through the transparent glass, indicating it is a red wine. The lighting is soft and even, casting a faint shadow beneath the bottle, enhancing its three-dimensional form.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction explicitly states:  
- Transform the **wine bottle into an engaging fantasy character**, implying a complete transformation of the object’s physical form into an animated entity.  
- Add **expressive eyes just below the label** — this indicates the label area will be altered to include facial features.  
- Add **whimsical vines wrapping around to form limbs** — this implies structural modification of the bottle’s silhouette to include vine-based limbs.  
- Convert the **label icon into a face expressing curiosity** — this directly modifies the original scarecrow icon into a facial expression.  
- Create an **enchanted vineyard backdrop with animated grapevine elements and mystical mist** — this completely replaces the original plain white background.  
- Title the scene as **"The Curious Scarecrow Wine Adventure"** — this adds textual content not present in the original.

From this, we deduce that:
- The **bottle's original shape** can be transformed.
- The **label’s content** (text and icon) can be modified.
- The **background** can be entirely replaced.
- The **color and texture of the wine inside** are not mentioned, so they may be changed.
- The **twine and capsule** are not referenced, but since they are part of the original design, their retention depends on whether they are integral to identity.

However, the instruction does **not** mention changing or removing:
- The **scarecrow icon’s original position** or **its symbolic role** (it becomes a face, but still retains its identity as the scarecrow).
- The **brand name "SCARECROW"** — although it may be repositioned or stylized, it must remain identifiable.
- The **vintage year "2017"** — likely retained for continuity, though possibly integrated into the fantasy design.

Thus, while the **form** of the bottle is allowed to change, the **core identity markers** (name, icon, year) must still be recognizable in the new context.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
- The overall shape of the bottle (can be transformed into a character)  
- The background (can be replaced with enchanted vineyard)  
- The label icon (can be converted into a curious face)  
- The addition of expressive eyes below the label  
- The addition of vine limbs forming arms/legs  
- The inclusion of animated grapevines and mystical mist  
- The title text “The Curious Scarecrow Wine Adventure” (new element)  
- The internal wine color (possibly altered)  
- The twine and capsule (not specified; may be removed or reimagined)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
We now identify what **must remain unchanged** based on exclusion from the allowed changes list and core recognition logic.

**Core recognition elements:**  
- The **word "SCARECROW"** is the primary brand identifier. Even if stylized, it must remain legible and in the same relative position (centered on the label) to preserve brand identity. Changing it would make the product unrecognizable.  
- The **year "2017"** is a key vintage marker. It must remain visible and associated with the bottle, even if integrated into the fantasy design (e.g., engraved on a vine limb or part of the face).  
- The **scarecrow icon** is central to the brand’s visual identity. While it is to be transformed into a face, its **original form as a scarecrow** (straw hat, simple figure) must be preserved in the transformation—i.e., the new face should still reflect the scarecrow’s essence (e.g., a hat-shaped head, rustic features). This is critical for maintaining brand consistency.  

**Functional/logical association elements:**  
- The **label itself** is a functional component of a wine bottle—it communicates brand and vintage. Though it will be reimagined, its **presence as a central rectangular area** on the bottle must remain, even if decorated with vines or eyes.  
- The **relationship between the label and the bottle** must be preserved: the label remains attached to the front of the bottle, serving as the focal point of branding.  

**Non-modified element deduction:**  
- The **color scheme** of the label (light gray background) is not mentioned, so it could change, but the **contrast** between the label and the dark bottle should remain to ensure readability.  
- The **position of the label** (centered vertically) must remain, as it is standard for wine bottles and essential for brand recognition.  
- The **overall orientation of the bottle** (upright) is implied by the instructions (“transform the wine bottle”), suggesting it remains vertical, even if animated.  
- The **twine and capsule** are not mentioned, but they are part of the original aesthetic. However, since they are not central to the brand identity (unlike the label), they may be omitted or reimagined. But if kept, they must retain their **texture and placement** (around the neck).

Thus, the **core identity** hinges on:
- The **word "SCARECROW"**
- The **year "2017"**
- The **scarecrow icon’s transformation into a face** (must still resemble a scarecrow)
- The **label’s position and function**
- The **bottle’s upright orientation**

---

**Preservation Targets List:**  
- The presence and legibility of the word "SCARECROW" on the label  
- The presence and visibility of the year "2017"  
- The scarecrow icon being transformed into a face that retains scarecrow-like features (e.g., straw hat, rustic appearance)  
- The label remaining a central rectangular element on the bottle’s front  
- The bottle remaining upright in orientation  
- The label’s position centered vertically on the bottle

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The word "SCARECROW" is the brand name and the primary identifier of the product. Its presence and legibility are essential for brand recognition. Even if stylized in a fantasy context, it must remain readable and positioned centrally on the label. If lost or obscured, the product cannot be identified as Scarecrow wine. Therefore, this is a core identity element with a weight of 3 points.
    Question: Is the word "SCARECROW" clearly visible and legible on the label?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The year "2017" is a key vintage indicator. It must remain visible to maintain product authenticity and historical context. Even if integrated into the fantasy design (e.g., floating near the face or etched on a vine), it must be present and readable. Losing it would remove important product information and affect coherence with the original image. Thus, it is an important detail with a weight of 2 points.
    Question: Is the year "2017" visible somewhere on the bottle or label?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The scarecrow icon is the iconic symbol of the brand. Although the instruction says to convert it into a face expressing curiosity, it must still retain core scarecrow features such as a straw hat and rustic appearance. If transformed into a generic cartoon face without these traits, the brand identity is lost. This is a core recognition element, hence a weight of 3 points.
    Question: Does the icon at the top of the label, now transformed into a face, retain the shape of a straw hat and rustic features consistent with a scarecrow?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The label must remain a central rectangular element on the bottle’s front to maintain the structure of a wine bottle. Even if vines wrap around it or eyes are added, the label’s basic shape and position must be preserved. Removing or distorting it would break the logical relationship between the product and its packaging. This is a functional element, so it has a weight of 2 points.
    Question: Is the label still a rectangular shape positioned centrally on the front of the bottle?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The bottle must remain upright to preserve its identity as a wine bottle. Tilting or lying down would disrupt the expected form and could mislead viewers about the product type. This is a fundamental posture requirement, so it is a key structural element with a weight of 2 points.
    Question: Is the bottle oriented vertically, standing upright?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The label’s position on the bottle must be centered vertically to match the original design. Deviation would make the label appear off-center, affecting visual balance and brand consistency. While minor shifts might be acceptable, the core alignment must be preserved. This is a detail-level element, so it has a weight of 1 point.
    Question: Is the label positioned exactly in the center of the bottle’s height?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
