      "thinking_process": "The lime green body of the saree with evenly spaced golden diamond-shaped butis is the primary visual identifier of the garment. If this pattern is altered or removed, the saree loses its defining characteristic. The instruction specifies rendering the fabric in marble but not changing the design, so the pattern must remain. This is a core identity feature, hence weight 3.",
      "question": "Is the lime green body of the saree adorned with small golden diamond-shaped butis evenly distributed across the fabric?",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The blue border and pallu with elephant motifs and alternating gold and blue stripes are distinctive elements of the saree’s design. These are central to its cultural and aesthetic identity. The instruction requires preserving fabric details in marble, meaning these patterns must remain intact. Altering them would misrepresent the original.",
      "question": "Does the pallu feature a blue and gold striped pattern with repeating elephant motifs in gold zari?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The royal blue blouse with golden embroidery on the neckline and sleeves is a key component of the outfit. It matches the saree’s border and contributes to the overall harmony. Since it is not mentioned in the editing instruction as being changed, and it is visually inseparable from the saree’s identity, it must be preserved. Its color and embroidery are essential.",
      "question": "Is the blouse royal blue with golden embroidered detailing along the neckline and sleeve edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The necklace with red and green stones is specifically mentioned to be preserved as an \"engraved accent.\" This indicates that its shape, placement, and gemstone arrangement must remain. Removing or altering it would violate the instruction and break continuity with the original.",
      "question": "Is there a necklace with red and green stones positioned around the neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The earrings are part of the jewelry set and are described as matching the necklace. Their presence in the ears is crucial for maintaining the original appearance. The instruction preserves jewelry as engraved accents, so their shape and location must be retained.",
      "question": "Are there earrings matching the necklace visible in both ears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The golden bangle on the right wrist is a minor but identifiable accessory. Though not central, it contributes to the completeness of the attire. The instruction does not mention removing accessories, and since it is clearly visible, it should be preserved in form and position.",
      "question": "Is there a golden bangle present on the right wrist?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The bindi on the forehead is a cultural detail that is part of the original image. While not structurally critical, it is a recognizable facial feature. Since no instruction specifies its removal, and it is consistently present in such portrayals, it should be preserved.",
      "question": "Is there a bindi visible on the center of the forehead?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
