### Description of Reference Image:
The subject is a man walking away from the camera along a narrow urban street. He is wearing a dark denim jacket, dark pants, and a black cap. His right hand holds a brown leather briefcase. The street is paved with cobblestones, and the buildings on either side are old, featuring arched doorways and windows. The lighting suggests an overcast day.

### Thinking Process:
The editing instructions specify transforming the scene and the man into a stop-motion Lego diorama. This means the textures, materials, and forms of the man and the street can be altered to resemble Lego bricks. However, the core identity of the man and the essential elements of the street scene must be retained.

### Allowed Changes List:
- The textures of the manâ€™s clothing, skin, and the briefcase can be changed to mimic Lego bricks.
- The textures of the cobblestones and building facades can be replaced with Lego brick textures.
- The proportions and angles of the man and the street can be adjusted to fit the Lego aesthetic.

### Thinking Process:
Core recognition elements include the man's posture, the briefcase he carries, and the general layout of the street. Functional/logical elements include the man holding the briefcase and his position on the street. Remaining elements like the color of the jacket and the shape of the buildings should be retained for visual coherence.

### Preservation Targets List:
- The man's posture and direction of movement.
- The presence and position of the briefcase.
- The general layout and perspective of the street.
- The man's outfit (denim jacket, dark pants, cap).
- The shape and arrangement of the buildings.
