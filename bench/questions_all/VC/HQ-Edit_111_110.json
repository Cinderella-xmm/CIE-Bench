      "thinking_process": "The key-shaped symbol on the leftmost book of the bottom shelf is a core visual identifier of the original design, distinguishing it from other books and contributing to the symbolic richness of the scene. Its presence and distinct form (a circular key with swirling arms and a central knob) are essential for recognizing the original artwork’s intent. Losing this would make the transformation unrecognizable as a reinterpretation of the source. Therefore, it is a high-weight core element.",
      "question": "Is the key-shaped symbol with swirling arms and central knob present on the leftmost book of the bottom shelf?",

      "thinking_process": "The spiral motif on the central book of the bottom shelf is another unique carved design that contributes to the thematic consistency of the artwork. It is visually distinct from the other patterns and serves as a focal point. Its absence would disrupt the symmetry and symbolic balance of the lower section, making the recreation inconsistent with the original.",
      "question": "Is the spiral motif clearly visible on the central book of the bottom shelf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The vine-like design on the rightmost book of the bottom shelf is a distinctive organic carving that mirrors the naturalistic themes in the upper carvings. It completes the triad of symbolic designs and is crucial for maintaining the original’s visual narrative. Its loss would break the intentional symmetry and thematic unity.",
      "question": "Is the flowing vine-like pattern present on the rightmost book of the bottom shelf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The Celtic knotwork patterns on the top panel and vertical sides are iconic elements that define the ornamental style of the bookshelf. Their intricate interlacing is a hallmark of the design and must be preserved even when rendered in LEGO bricks. Without them, the aesthetic identity of the piece is compromised.",
      "question": "Are the interlacing Celtic knotwork patterns present on the top panel and vertical side frames of the bookshelf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The arrangement of the three large, carved books at the bottom shelf—left, center, and right—is a deliberate compositional choice that balances the design. Their relative positions and sizes create a visual anchor. Changing their placement or omitting any would distort the original layout and reduce coherence.",
      "question": "Are the three large books with detailed carvings positioned side by side on the bottom shelf, from left to right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The presence of multiple books with carved spines across all shelves (not just the bottom) contributes to the overall theme of ornate craftsmanship. While individual books may vary, the consistent appearance of patterned spines maintains visual continuity. Their absence would make the LEGO version appear less faithful to the original's rich detail.",
      "question": "Are there at least four books with visible carved spines distributed across the middle and upper shelves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The earthy color palette—comprising browns, tans, and muted reds—is specified in the editing instruction as a requirement (\"earthy tones\"). Although the material changes, the color scheme is a key attribute of the original and must be preserved to maintain visual harmony and authenticity.",
      "question": "Are the books and structural elements rendered in earthy tones such as brown, tan, and muted red?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
