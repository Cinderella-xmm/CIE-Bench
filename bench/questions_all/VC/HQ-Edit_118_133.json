      "thinking_process": "The ornate scrollwork and floral engraving patterns are the defining artistic feature of the teapot, distinguishing it from other vessels. These intricate designs are essential to its identity as a Baroque-style artifact. If removed or simplified, the object loses its visual essence and cannot be recognized as derived from the original. Thus, preserving the exact pattern layout and density is critical for identification.",
      "question": "Is the complex scrollwork and floral engraving pattern visible on the body, lid, and spout of the object?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The lid with its domed shape and finial is a core structural identifier. Its absence or replacement with a flat cap would fundamentally alter the object’s identity. Even if made of ceramic, the lid must retain its original shape and placement to maintain continuity with the source image.",
      "question": "Does the object have a domed lid topped with a small finial at the apex?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The three-legged pedestal base is a unique structural feature that defines the teapot’s stability and aesthetic balance. Removing or altering its shape would disrupt the object’s proportional harmony and make it unrecognizable as the original piece.",
      "question": "Is the object supported by a three-legged pedestal base with decorative feet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The handle’s curve and its attachment point to the body are distinctive. Even though it is to be transformed into a gold accent, its original position and arc must be preserved to maintain spatial consistency. Changing its location would distort the object’s balance and break visual logic.",
      "question": "Is there a curved handle attached to the left side of the object, extending upward and backward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The spout’s elongated, curved shape is a key functional and aesthetic component. Although it is to be replaced with a wick, its position and orientation must remain unchanged to preserve the object’s silhouette. Moving or shortening it would alter the overall form and break continuity.",
      "question": "Is there a long, curved spout extending from the right side of the object’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The reflective wooden surface and the clear reflection of the object are integral to the original composition. They provide depth and context. Removing the reflection or changing the surface would disconnect the object from its environment and reduce visual fidelity.",
      "question": "Is the object placed on a polished wooden surface with a clear reflection visible beneath it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The ornamental metal fittings connecting the handle to the body are minor but distinctive details that add to the craftsmanship. Their presence contributes to the authenticity of the original design. While less critical than major forms, their loss would reduce visual coherence.",
      "question": "Are there decorative metal fittings where the handle attaches to the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
