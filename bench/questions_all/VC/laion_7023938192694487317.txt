**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a man with short, neatly styled dark brown hair, wearing black-rimmed glasses with a slight tortoiseshell pattern on the temples. He has a well-groomed reddish-brown beard and mustache, and is smiling slightly with visible teeth. He wears a long-sleeved black athletic shirt made of a smooth, form-fitting synthetic material. The shirt features a white "CRAFT" logo in sans-serif font on the upper right shoulder area, accompanied by a small cluster of three white dots beneath it. On the left chest area, there is a stylized red, white, and blue logo shaped like a "Z" with diagonal stripes resembling the American flag, beneath which the text "healthcare" appears in lowercase white letters with a red outline. The background is a plain, neutral gray wall with a subtle textured pattern. The lighting is even and frontal, highlighting facial features without harsh shadows.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction specifies transforming the individual’s torso and attire into an **oversized figurine**, emphasizing the **"Craft" logo** and changing the material to **matte-finished black polymer**. The figurine will have a **detachable base** made of **polished metal with reflection**. This indicates that:

- The **form of the torso and clothing** can be altered (e.g., scaled up, stylized, converted into a figurine).
- The **material of the shirt** is explicitly changed from fabric to **matte black polymer** — this is allowed.
- The **logo design** ("Craft" and "Z healthcare") is to be **emphasized**, suggesting its visual presence must remain but possibly enhanced or stylized.
- The **base** is new and not present in the original — so no need to preserve it.
- The **background** is not mentioned as preserved, so it may be replaced or modified.
- The **head, face, glasses, beard, and hair** are not mentioned for change — but since the transformation focuses on the **torso and attire**, these facial features may be retained in a stylized form if part of the figurine.

Allowed Changes List:  
- Form and scale of the torso and clothing (transformed into figurine)  
- Material of the shirt (changed to matte black polymer)  
- Addition of a detachable metallic base  
- Emphasis and possible stylization of the "Craft" and "Z healthcare" logos (though their core design must remain identifiable)  
- Background (not required to be preserved)  
- Proportions of the body (can be exaggerated for figurine effect)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
We now identify what **must remain unchanged** based on exclusion from the allowed changes list and logical necessity.

**Core recognition elements:**  
- The **"CRAFT" logo** is explicitly named in the instructions as needing emphasis — therefore, its **presence, position, and identity** must be preserved, even if stylized. It is a brand identifier and key to the transformation logic.
- The **"Z healthcare" logo** is also central to the identity of the shirt and likely represents an organization or sponsor. Its **distinctive shape (stylized Z with American flag-like stripes)** and **text label** are essential for recognition.
- The **color scheme** of the logos (red, white, blue for Z; white for CRAFT) should remain consistent unless otherwise stated — but the instruction says “elevated, bold colors” for the logo, which implies enhancement, not removal. Thus, the **original color identity** must be preserved, though intensified.
- The **position of the logos**: "CRAFT" on the upper right shoulder and "Z healthcare" on the left chest — these positions are critical for correct identification and branding. Even in a figurine form, they must remain in **relative anatomical locations**.

**Functional/logical association elements:**  
- The **relationship between the logos and the shirt** must be maintained — i.e., both logos are part of the same garment. If the shirt is transformed into a figurine, the logos must still appear on the correct side of the torso.
- The **overall identity of the individual** is tied to his **facial features**, especially the **glasses**, **beard**, and **hair**, which are not mentioned for modification. Since the transformation is limited to the torso and attire, the **head and facial details** should be preserved in form, even if stylized or simplified in a figurine context.

**Non-modified element deduction:**  
- The **texture of the shirt** is being changed (from fabric to polymer), so texture is allowed to change.
- The **background** is not preserved — so it can be removed or replaced.
- The **posture** (standing, facing forward) is implied to be retained due to the nature of the figurine — but the instruction doesn’t specify posture change, so it should be preserved.
- The **smile and expression** are not mentioned — thus, likely preserved for continuity.

Preservation Targets List:  
- The presence and position of the "CRAFT" logo on the upper right shoulder  
- The presence and position of the "Z healthcare" logo on the left chest  
- The distinctive shape of the "Z" logo (with red, white, and blue striped design)  
- The text "healthcare" beneath the "Z" logo  
- The facial features: glasses, beard, mustache, hair style, and smile  
- The overall orientation of the figure (facing forward, standing upright)

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

Q1:  
Thinking process: The "CRAFT" logo is explicitly referenced in the editing instruction as needing emphasis. Its presence and location are critical for brand identity. The logo consists of the word "CRAFT" in white sans-serif font with three small dots below it. If this logo is missing or relocated, the figurine would not align with the original branding. Therefore, preserving its presence and position is essential for identity retention. This is a core brand identifier, making it a 3-point question.  
Question: Is the "CRAFT" logo present on the upper right shoulder of the figurine?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The "Z healthcare" logo is a unique composite symbol combining a stylized "Z" with American flag-inspired stripes and the word "healthcare." This specific combination is the primary identifying mark of the organization represented. Removing or altering its structure would destroy its recognizability. The instruction emphasizes this logo, meaning it must remain visually intact, even if enhanced. This is a core identity element.  
Question: Is the stylized "Z" logo with red, white, and blue diagonal stripes present on the left chest of the figurine?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The text "healthcare" beneath the "Z" logo is a critical component of the full brand identity. Without it, the logo loses its full meaning and becomes ambiguous. The instruction does not suggest removing it, only enhancing it. Thus, its presence and placement are essential for accurate representation. This is a key detail contributing to the identity of the logo.  
Question: Is the word "healthcare" in lowercase white letters with a red outline located directly beneath the "Z" logo on the left chest?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The man's facial features—specifically the glasses, beard, and hairstyle—are not mentioned for alteration. In a figurine transformation, these features are likely to be preserved for personal identification. The glasses are a distinct feature (black frames with tortoiseshell temples), and the beard is prominent and well-defined. Their absence would make the figurine unrecognizable as the original person. This is a core recognition element.  
Question: Are the black-framed glasses with tortoiseshell-patterned temples visible on the figurine’s face?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The beard and mustache are a defining facial characteristic of the individual. Their presence and reddish-brown color help distinguish him from others. Since the transformation is focused on the torso, the head and facial hair are expected to remain unchanged in form. Altering them would compromise identity. This is a core identity feature.  
Question: Is the reddish-brown beard and mustache clearly visible on the figurine’s face?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The position of the logos is crucial for correct branding. The "CRAFT" logo must be on the upper right shoulder, and the "Z healthcare" logo on the left chest. These positions establish the spatial relationship of the branding elements. Misplacing them would create confusion and break the intended visual layout. This is a key spatial relationship that supports identity.  
Question: Is the "CRAFT" logo positioned on the upper right shoulder and the "Z healthcare" logo on the left chest of the figurine?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The overall orientation of the figure (facing forward, standing upright) is implied by the original image and necessary for a coherent figurine representation. While the instruction does not specify posture, changing it would disrupt the consistency with the original pose. This is a minor but important detail for visual coherence.  
Question: Is the figurine oriented upright and facing forward, matching the original stance?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1
