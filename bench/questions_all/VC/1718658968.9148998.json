      "thinking_process": "The twin-tower configuration is the most defining architectural feature of the castle, distinguishing it from other types of buildings. The towers are identical in height, width, and window placement, positioned symmetrically on either side of the central block. Changing their number, spacing, or form would fundamentally alter the identity of the structure. Thus, preserving this layout is essential for maintaining the core identity of the castle.",
      "question": "Are the two tall towers positioned symmetrically on either side of the central section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The arched entrance is a key architectural identifier, both functionally and aesthetically. Its semi-circular shape, central location, and integration with the steps below make it a focal point. Altering its shape (e.g., making it rectangular) or relocating it would break the visual continuity and recognition of the building. It is a core feature tied to the castle’s design language.",
      "question": "Is there a centrally located arched doorway with a wooden door beneath a rounded arch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The stepped staircase leading to the entrance is a critical structural element that connects the ground level to the main entry. Its shape, position, and integration with the base of the archway define the access path. Removing or reshaping it would disrupt the functional logic of the castle and alter its appearance significantly.",
      "question": "Does a set of stone steps ascend from the water level directly to the arched entrance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The rectangular windows with dark frames are distributed in a consistent pattern across the towers and central section. Their number, size, and placement contribute to the symmetry and historical character of the castle. While their material may change, their positions and shapes must remain fixed to preserve the architectural rhythm and proportion.",
      "question": "Are there multiple rectangular windows with dark frames aligned vertically on each tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The flat-topped towers with crenellated parapets are distinctive features that signal a defensive or medieval style. These details are not just decorative—they are part of the castle’s iconic silhouette. Even if the material changes, the presence and shape of these crenellations must be retained to preserve the architectural authenticity.",
      "question": "Do the tops of both towers feature flat surfaces with crenellated edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The low stone wall extending from the right side of the castle adds depth and context to the structure, indicating a possible enclosure or boundary. Though not central, its presence contributes to the completeness of the architectural composition. Its removal would leave an asymmetrical gap, disrupting visual balance.",
      "question": "Is there a low stone wall extending horizontally from the right side of the castle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
