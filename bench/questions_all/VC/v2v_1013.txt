### Step 1 - Description of Reference Image and Allowed Changes List:

**Description of Reference Image:**  
The image features two small birds perched on a branch. On the left is a sparrow with a mix of brown, gray, and white feathers, a black beak, and a distinct black bib under its chin. Its posture is upright, facing slightly towards the right. On the right is a blue tit, characterized by vibrant blue and yellow plumage, a white face with a black stripe, and a small black beak. Both birds are positioned closely together, facing each other, against a plain beige background. The branch they perch on has some green moss.

**Thinking Process:**  
The instructions specify transforming the birds into anime-style models while preserving their postures, feather textures, and coloration. The scene is to be changed to a desktop setting viewed casually from a mobile phone perspective. The background and branch can be altered, but the birds' core features must remain intact.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
1. The birds' forms can be transformed into anime-style models.  
2. The scene can be changed to a desktop with a mobile phone perspective.  
3. The background can be replaced.  
4. The branch can be modified or removed.  

### Step 2 - Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged:

**Thinking Process:**  
Core recognition elements include the birds' distinctive coloration, feather patterns, and postures. Functional/logical elements involve the birds' positioning relative to each other, ensuring they still appear to be interacting. Remaining elements like the birds' eyes, beaks, and feet should also be retained for visual coherence.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
1. The sparrow's brown, gray, and white feather patterns and black bib.  
2. The blue tit's blue and yellow plumage, white face, and black stripe.  
3. The birds' postures and orientation toward each other.  
4. The birds' eyes, beaks, and feet.
