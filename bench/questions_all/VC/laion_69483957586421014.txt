Description of reference image: The subject is a Waring brand food processor, presented in a front-facing view against a plain white background. The appliance has a two-part structure: a silver metallic base with black feet and a black processing bowl mounted on top. The base features three control buttons—red "OFF," green "ON," and blue "PULSE"—arranged horizontally above the central "WARING" logo, which is displayed in bold white capital letters on a black rectangular plaque with a textured border. The processing bowl is made of glossy black plastic with a transparent lid that includes a feed tube and a pusher mechanism. A black handle is attached to the left side of the bowl for stability. The feed tube is cylindrical and extends vertically from the lid, ending in a flat cap with a small lever. The overall design is sleek and modern, with clean lines and a professional-grade appearance.

Thinking process:  
The editing instruction specifies transforming the food processor into **packaging**—a box designed to resemble a high-end kitchen appliance container. This implies that the **physical form of the appliance itself will be altered or replaced** by an illustrated version on a box. However, the instruction explicitly requires **retaining key visual characteristics** such as the brand name ("Waring"), the **isometric illustration** of the processor, and **exploded view graphics** of its components. Therefore, while the **scene (background and context)** and **form (from 3D object to 2D packaging)** are allowed to change, certain **core visual identifiers** must remain intact.

Allowed Changes List:  
- The physical form of the appliance (it becomes a graphic on a box)  
- The background (changes from white to packaging design)  
- The perspective (shifts to isometric view on packaging)  
- The inclusion of exploded view diagrams  
- The addition of metallic silver and matte black color scheme for the box  
- Typography style and layout on the box  
- Scene context (from product shot to product packaging)

Step 2– Determine the elements that should remain unchanged  
Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements: The **brand name "WARING"** is critical for identity—it is a trademarked name and the primary identifier of the product. Its presence, font style (bold sans-serif), and placement (centered on the base) are essential for recognition. The **three-button control panel** (red OFF, green ON, blue PULSE) is a functional feature that distinguishes this model from others and reflects its operational logic. The **black processing bowl with handle**, **transparent lid**, and **vertical feed tube** are iconic structural elements unique to this food processor design. These define its category and usability.

Functional/logical association elements: The **relationship between the base and bowl** must remain consistent—i.e., the bowl sits atop the base, connected via a locking mechanism. While the exploded view may show disassembled parts, their relative positions and interconnectivity must reflect actual functionality. The **feed tube's vertical orientation** and **pusher mechanism** are necessary for operation and thus must be preserved in any illustration.

Non-modified element deduction: Elements not mentioned in the allowed changes list—such as the **texture of the base**, **color of the buttons**, **shape of the handle**, **lid transparency**, and **overall silhouette**—must be retained in the illustration because they are not specified for modification. Even though the scene changes, the **visual fidelity** of the original appliance’s design must be maintained to ensure the packaging accurately represents the product.

Preservation Targets List:  
- The brand name "WARING" in bold white text on a black textured plaque  
- The red "OFF", green "ON", and blue "PULSE" buttons in their respective positions  
- The black processing bowl with integrated handle  
- The transparent lid with feed tube and pusher mechanism  
- The vertical cylindrical feed tube extending from the lid  
- The silver metallic base with black feet  
- The overall silhouette and proportions of the food processor

    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The brand name "WARING" is the core identity element of the product. It is the most recognizable feature that links the appliance to its manufacturer. If this logo is omitted, altered in spelling, or changed in style, the product would no longer be identifiable as a Waring appliance. This is a trademarked identifier and must be preserved exactly as shown in the original image.
    Question: Is the brand name "WARING" displayed in bold white capital letters on a black rectangular plaque with a textured border?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3

    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The three control buttons—red "OFF", green "ON", and blue "PULSE"—are functional indicators that define the user interface of the appliance. Their specific colors and labels are essential for correct operation and identification. Changing any of these would misrepresent the product's controls and could lead to confusion in use or marketing.
    Question: Are the control buttons labeled "OFF" (red), "ON" (green), and "PULSE" (blue) arranged horizontally on the base?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3

{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The black processing bowl with its integrated handle is a defining structural feature of the food processor. It distinguishes this model from others and is essential for handling during use. The shape and placement of the handle are critical for ergonomics and must be preserved in any representation.
    Question: Does the processing bowl have a black handle attached to its left side?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The transparent lid with the feed tube and pusher mechanism is a key functional component that allows ingredients to be added during operation. The visibility of the lid and the presence of the feed tube are essential for identifying the appliance’s purpose and design. Removing or altering this feature would misrepresent the product’s capabilities.
    Question: Is there a transparent lid covering the bowl with a vertical feed tube and a pusher mechanism visible at the top?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2

{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The vertical cylindrical feed tube is a distinctive design element that enables continuous feeding during processing. Its shape and position are crucial for understanding the appliance’s function. Any deviation from its original form would compromise the accuracy of the product representation.
    Question: Is the feed tube a tall, vertical cylinder extending upward from the center of the lid?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The silver metallic base with black feet provides the foundation of the appliance and contributes to its professional aesthetic. The color contrast and material texture are important for visual consistency and brand identity. Altering the base color or removing the feet would change the product’s appearance significantly.
    Question: Is the base of the food processor silver metallic with black feet at the bottom corners?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The overall silhouette and proportions of the food processor are essential for maintaining its recognizability. Even if viewed from an isometric angle on packaging, the relative sizes of the base, bowl, and feed tube must remain accurate to preserve the product’s identity.
    Question: Does the food processor maintain the same proportional relationship between the base, bowl, and feed tube as shown in the original image?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
