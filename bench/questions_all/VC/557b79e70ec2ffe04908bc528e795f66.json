      "thinking_process": "The mustache is one of the most iconic and immediately recognizable features of Albert Einstein. Its shape—curved, thick, and positioned just below the nose—is essential for identifying him. In any stylized or transformed representation, especially a plush doll, losing this feature would make the character unrecognizable. Therefore, preserving the mustache’s presence and basic shape is critical for core identity retention. This element directly corresponds to a key visual identifier in the original image.",
      "question": "Is the mustache present and shaped in a way that matches the original image, with a curved, thick form extending from both sides of the upper lip?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The wild, voluminous white hair is another hallmark of Einstein’s appearance. It is not merely hair but a specific configuration—untamed, flowing, and unevenly distributed across the head—that contributes significantly to his public identity. Even in a plush version, the hair must maintain this chaotic, full-bodied quality to be identifiable. The texture may change, but the silhouette and distribution must remain faithful.",
      "question": "Does the hair retain its wild, voluminous, and unevenly distributed white appearance, particularly with strands extending outward from the sides and top of the head?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The vertical black stripes on the sweater are explicitly required to be maintained in the edited version, even if rendered as stitched patterns. These stripes are not random—they form a distinct visual pattern that is part of the original garment’s design. Their absence or alteration would violate the instruction and disrupt visual consistency. They serve as a functional detail that anchors the clothing to the original image.",
      "question": "Are there vertical black stripes running down the front of the sweater, matching the pattern seen in the original image?",

      "thinking_process": "The collar of the shirt is visible beneath the sweater in the original image. Although the instruction allows for miniaturization and stylization, the logical relationship between the sweater and the shirt remains important. The collar must still be present and positioned under the sweater’s neckline to maintain fidelity to the original layering. Its absence would suggest a different outfit or misrepresentation.",
      "question": "Is a portion of a light-colored shirt collar visible beneath the sweater’s neckline, aligned with the original image?",

      "thinking_process": "The facial structure—specifically the placement of the eyes, nose, and forehead lines—is crucial for maintaining likeness. While proportions may be exaggerated in the plush version, the relative positions of these features must remain consistent to preserve recognition. For example, the eyes should still be set wide apart, the nose prominent, and the forehead lined with wrinkles. Altering their spatial relationships would distort the identity.",
      "question": "Do the eyes, nose, and forehead lines maintain their original relative positions and shapes, such as the horizontal creases on the forehead and the oval shape of the eyes?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The sweater’s ribbed texture is visible in the original image, particularly around the neckline and shoulders. While the instruction allows for stylization as stitched patterns, the fundamental texture and shape of the sweater must remain recognizable. A smooth or entirely flat surface would deviate too far from the original. The ribbing provides structural detail that supports identification.",
      "question": "Is the sweater’s neckline and shoulder area textured with ribbed patterns consistent with the original image?",
