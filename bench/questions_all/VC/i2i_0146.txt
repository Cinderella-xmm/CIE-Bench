Description of reference image: The subject is a zebra facing slightly towards the right, standing upright on a grassy field with a vibrant green background. Its body is covered with distinct black and white stripes, with the stripes extending vertically along the neck and horizontally across the body. The zebra has an upright mane, upright ears, and a small tufted tail. The ground shows some grass blades in the foreground, enhancing the natural setting.

### Step 1: Allowed Changes List

Thinking process: After carefully reading the instructions, I understand that the zebra is to be transformed into a childrenâ€™s cartoon zebra toy while retaining certain features. This transformation may allow for changes in proportions, color vibrancy, and overall style, such as simplifying the design and adding playful elements. However, the iconic stripes and upright ears must be retained.

- Specific element 1 that allows for changes: Proportions of the zebra's body (e.g., making it more rounded or compact).
- Specific element 2 that allows for changes: Color vibrancy and saturation (making the colors brighter and more saturated for a cartoonish look).
- Specific element 3 that allows for changes: Background elements (the current green background can be changed to something more whimsical or simplified).

### Step 2: Preservation Targets List

Thinking process: Core recognition elements for a zebra include its black and white stripes and upright ears. Functional elements like the zebra's body structure and striped pattern help in identifying it correctly. Other details such as the mane, position, and general posture also contribute to visual coherence.

Preservation Targets List:  
(Element 1 that should be maintained): Black and white stripes covering the zebra's body.  
(Element 2 that should be maintained): Upright ears.  
(Element 3 that should be maintained): Mane on the neck.  
(Element 4 that should be maintained): Tail with a tuft of hair.  
(Element 5 that should be maintained): General standing posture of the zebra.
