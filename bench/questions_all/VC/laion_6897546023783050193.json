      "thinking_process": "The outstretched arms are a core identifying feature of this statue, directly tied to its religious symbolism and public recognition. In the original image, both arms extend horizontally to the sides, forming a T-shape. This pose is iconic and distinguishes it from other statues. Even if stylized into calligraphic lines, the horizontal extension must be preserved to maintain the figure’s identity. Loss of this posture would fundamentally alter the statue’s meaning and recognition.",
      "question": "Are both arms extended horizontally to the sides, forming a symmetrical T-shape?",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The head tilt upward and slightly to the left is a distinctive pose that contributes to the figure’s contemplative and divine expression. It is a key visual cue in identifying the statue as Christ the Redeemer-type figures. Although the facial features may be softened, the direction of the head must remain unchanged to preserve the intended emotional and symbolic tone. Altering this would misrepresent the figure’s orientation and intent.",
      "question": "Is the head tilted upward and slightly toward the left side of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The presence of a beard and hair beneath a hooded garment is a defining characteristic of the figure’s identity as Jesus Christ. This feature is consistently present in such religious statues and is essential for recognition. Even if the facial details are simplified, the beard and hood must remain to preserve the figure’s identity. Removing them would make the figure unrecognizable.",
      "question": "Does the figure have a beard and hair covered by a hooded garment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The open palms with fingers slightly curved are a symbolic gesture of blessing or welcome, central to the statue’s meaning. In the original image, both hands are clearly open, palms forward. This gesture is not just aesthetic but functional in conveying the figure’s message. Even if stylized, the openness of the palms must be preserved to maintain the symbolic integrity.",
      "question": "Are both hands open with palms facing forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The robe covers the entire body from shoulders to base and features vertical folds, which define its silhouette and structure. This full-length drape is essential to the figure’s appearance and helps distinguish it from other types of statues. While the texture and color may change, the overall form and coverage must remain to preserve the original shape and identity.",
      "question": "Does the robe cover the entire body from shoulders to the base of the statue, with vertical folds running down the front?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The statue is positioned upright in a frontal pose, viewed from a low angle, which emphasizes its height and dominance. This perspective is crucial for conveying the statue’s grandeur and is part of the original image’s composition. While the background may be replaced, the low-angle view and frontal stance must remain to preserve the spatial relationship and viewer experience.",
      "question": "Is the statue shown in a frontal pose, viewed from a low angle looking upward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
