Description of reference image: The subject of the image is a train, specifically a white locomotive with the label "BB 3017". It is positioned centrally on a railway track surrounded by multiple parallel tracks on both sides. The train is hauling an open freight car loaded with materials. The setting appears to be a semi-rural area with greenery alongside the tracks and some scattered trees. There's also a railroad signal on the left, marked with the number "3". The lighting suggests it is daytime.

### Step 1 - Determine Allowed Changes
Thinking process: According to the editing instructions, the primary background, which includes the sky and the surrounding landscape, should be changed to an African savanna at night with a starry sky. This implies the current daytime setting and background scenery can be altered. However, the core elements such as the train and the railway tracks should remain largely consistent with their original appearance.

Allowed Changes List:
Specific element 1 that allows for changes: The current background including sky and landscape can be replaced by an African savanna scene at night.
Specific element 2 that allows for changes: Lighting conditions can be adjusted to represent nighttime illumination.

### Step 2 - Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged
Thinking process:
Core recognition elements include the train model, its labeling ("BB 3017"), and the layout of the railway tracks. These features are essential for recognizing the subject as a freight train on a railway. Functional/logical association elements include the train's position on the tracks and the intactness of the railway infrastructure. Non-modified elements should maintain the realistic visual coherence of the train and tracks even under the new lighting condition.

Preservation Targets List:
(Element 1 that should be maintained): The train's model and labeling ("BB 3017").
(Element 2 that should be maintained): The railway track layout.
(Element 3 that should be maintained): The train's position on the railway.
(Element 4 that should be maintained): The intact appearance of the train.

    Q1:
    Thinking process: The train's labeling "BB 3017" is a key identifier that aids in recognizing the train. Losing this text would make it challenging to confirm the train's specific model and origin, thus impacting the core identity.
    Question:Is the train labeled "BB 3017" still visible and legible?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q2:
    Thinking process: The railway track layout, including parallel tracks, is crucial for maintaining the scene's realism and ensuring the train's logical placement. Disrupting this layout would compromise the scene's integrity.
    Question:Are the railway tracks, including the parallel tracks beside the main line, still intact and correctly laid out?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q3:
    Thinking process: The train's central position on the railway is a functional/logical feature that ensures the train is correctly interacting with its environment. Changing this could lead to visual inconsistency.
    Question: Is the train still positioned centrally on the railway tracks?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q4:
    Thinking process: The train's intact appearance, including its structural design and cargo, is essential for maintaining visual coherence and recognizing the train as an operational freight train.
    Question:Does the train retain its structural integrity, including the white locomotive and the loaded freight car?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q5:
    Thinking process: The presence of the railroad signal on the left side, while not a core element, adds to the realistic setting of a railway environment. Its retention contributes to the overall scene consistency.
    Question:Is the railroad signal on the left, marked with the number "3", still present in the scene?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
