      "thinking_process": "The copper-colored top is the defining visual trait of Duracell Coppertop batteries, used globally to distinguish them from other alkaline brands. Its absence would make the batteries unrecognizable as Duracell products. This feature is critical for brand identity and consumer recognition, hence a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Are the battery tops rendered in copper color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The black body with the vertical \"DURACELL\" text in white is a core branding element across all Duracell Coppertop packaging. Changing this would fundamentally alter the product’s visual identity. Even in a stylized form, the presence of this text and color scheme must be preserved for recognition. Thus, it is assigned 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the word \"DURACELL\" printed vertically in white on the black body of each battery?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The \"DURALOCK\" band is a registered trademark and a key functional claim associated with the product’s longevity. While the instruction allows stylization, the presence of this label must be preserved to maintain logical continuity with the original product. Removing it would misrepresent the product’s features. Therefore, it is a 2-point element.",
      "question": "Is there a silver band near the base of each battery with the word \"DURALOCK\" inscribed on it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The \"10 Years in Storage\" guarantee is explicitly highlighted in the instruction as a key plot element. Though its presentation may change (e.g., digital screen), the actual phrase must appear in some form to fulfill the narrative requirement. Losing this text would break the intended story link. Hence, it is a 3-point element.",
      "question": "Is the phrase \"10 Years in Storage\" visibly present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The original package contains four batteries, which is a core product attribute. The instruction specifies transforming them into a team of four robot heroes, so the count must remain exactly four. Any deviation would misrepresent the product quantity and undermine consistency. Thus, this is a 2-point element.",
      "question": "Are there exactly four batteries or battery-inspired characters depicted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The brand name \"DURACELL\" appears prominently at the top of the original packaging and is essential for brand recognition. Even in a comic-style transformation, the name must be clearly visible to maintain authenticity. Its absence would render the image unidentifiable as a Duracell product. This is a 3-point element.",
      "question": "Is the brand name \"DURACELL\" displayed in large, bold letters at the top of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
