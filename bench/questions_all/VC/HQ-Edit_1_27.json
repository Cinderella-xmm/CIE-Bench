      "thinking_process": "The Eiffel Tower's iron lattice structure is its defining architectural feature, recognizable globally due to its unique crisscross pattern and open framework. If this texture were replaced or simplified, the tower would no longer be identifiable as the Eiffel Tower. This structural detail is the primary identifier of the subject and thus carries the highest weight.",
      "question": "Is the intricate iron lattice structure of the Eiffel Tower present, including its characteristic crisscross pattern and open framework?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The arched base of the Eiffel Tower, with its large central opening, is a key architectural feature that distinguishes it from other towers. It allows for passage underneath and contributes to the tower’s iconic silhouette. Losing this element would alter the tower’s identity and disrupt the visual continuity of the scene.",
      "question": "Is the arched base of the Eiffel Tower visible, with a clear central passage beneath the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The spire and crown at the top of the tower are signature elements, often used in depictions of the Eiffel Tower. They mark the vertical culmination of the structure and are essential for accurate recognition. Their absence would make the tower appear incomplete or misidentified.",
      "question": "Is the spire and crown structure at the very top of the Eiffel Tower present and clearly defined?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The symmetrical rows of lampposts and bare trees on either side of the path create a formal, balanced composition that leads the eye toward the tower. This layout is integral to the scene’s depth and perspective. While the lampposts may be resized or stylized, their alignment and spacing must be preserved to maintain the original spatial logic.",
      "question": "Are the rows of lampposts and bare-branched trees symmetrically arranged along both sides of the central path leading to the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The presence of people in the foreground, particularly those oriented toward the tower and engaged in activities like photography, establishes the tower as a destination and reinforces its cultural significance. Their placement maintains the narrative of observation and admiration, which is central to the image’s meaning.",
      "question": "Are there figures in the foreground positioned facing the Eiffel Tower, with some appearing to take photographs or observe it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The central linear perspective, where the path converges toward the tower, is a core compositional element that emphasizes scale and grandeur. This vanishing point effect is essential to the image’s visual impact. Even in a diorama format, the directional alignment of the path must remain consistent to preserve the original spatial dynamics.",
      "question": "Does the central pathway extend directly toward the Eiffel Tower, creating a strong linear perspective with convergence at the tower’s base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The snow-covered ground is a dominant environmental feature, contributing to the winter atmosphere. While the texture of the snow may be changed to \"powdery\" in the diorama, the fact that the ground is covered in snow must remain. Removing snow would contradict the original scene and undermine the seasonal context.",
      "question": "Is the ground fully covered in snow, with visible accumulation around the base of the tower and along the path?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
