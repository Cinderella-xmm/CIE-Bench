      "thinking_process": "The shape and arrangement of the child’s eyes are critical for facial recognition. In the original image, her eyes are almond-shaped with dark brown irises and a clear reflection of light, indicating a specific gaze direction. This feature is essential for identifying her as the same individual, especially when transformed into a stylized figure. Losing this detail would make the character unrecognizable, making it a core identity element.",

      "thinking_process": "The hair color and style are key identifiers. The original image shows light brown hair tied in a low ponytail with loose strands framing the face.

      "thinking_process": "The gaze direction toward the tablet is crucial for maintaining the narrative of engagement with technology. The child’s eyes are directed at the screen, which establishes the functional relationship between her and the device. This must be preserved to uphold the “tech whiz” theme.",
      "question": "Is the child’s gaze directed toward the tablet on the table?",

      "thinking_process": "The presence of the tablet on the wooden table is a functional element that supports the scene’s logic. Although the tablet may be stylized, its location and role as the object of attention must remain. Removing or relocating it would break the connection to the original context.",
