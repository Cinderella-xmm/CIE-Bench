Description of reference image: The subject is a Fujitsu fi-7160 flatbed document scanner, positioned centrally against a plain white background. It has a black and light gray body with a curved top surface and an open automatic document feeder (ADF) tray at the top, which holds several documents including a boarding pass, a receipt, and a payment slip. The ADF tray is angled upward and contains visible paper guides labeled for sizes A5, B5, A4, and LTR. The control panel on the right side includes a small monochrome LCD screen, five buttons (Menu, Stop/Clear, Scan/Enter, Power, and directional navigation), and a green illuminated power indicator. On the front of the device, below the scanning bed, there is a visible row of bristles or rubber rollers used to feed paper. The brand name "Fujitsu" and model number "fi-7160" are printed in silver text on the upper left corner of the scanner’s top cover. A small logo indicating “ImageScan Pro” is present near the bottom right of the control panel. The output tray at the front is open and black, designed to catch scanned documents. The overall design is functional, professional, and typical of office-grade scanners.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions that explicitly state the transformation: "Transform the scanner into a sleek, futuristic tech gadget packaging." This indicates the **subject's form** will be changed from a physical scanner to a **packaging box**, implying the original object no longer exists as-is. The instruction specifies **metallic textures**, **iridescent color scheme**, **holographic display**, **grid lines mimicking data flow**, and **tech-themed icons and branding**, all of which suggest complete visual reimagining of the scanner’s appearance and context.

The instruction does **not** mention retaining any part of the original scanner’s physical structure, function, or visual identity—only transforming it into a new entity (a product box). Therefore, the **allowed changes** include:
- The entire physical form of the scanner
- Color scheme and material texture
- Functional components (like ADF, rollers, control panel)
- Background and surrounding environment
- Branding placement and style

However, despite the transformation, certain **core elements** tied to identity must be preserved if they are referenced or implied in the transformation. Since the instruction says “design the box *with*...” and “include a holographic display showing the scanner in action,” this implies the **original scanner must still be visually represented** within the hologram or packaging content. Thus, while the outer form changes, the **internal representation** of the scanner must retain key identifiable features.

Allowed Changes List:
- Physical shape and structure of the scanner (transformed into packaging)
- Color palette (replaced with iridescent metallic tones)
- Material texture (changed to metallic/reflective surfaces)
- Control panel layout and button functions (replaced with stylized tech icons)
- Output tray and ADF mechanism (replaced with packaging design)
- Background (changed from white to abstract tech environment)
- Lighting and shadows (adjusted to match futuristic aesthetic)

Step 2 - Determine the elements that should remain unchanged  
Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements: Although the scanner itself is being transformed into packaging, the instruction includes a **holographic display showing the scanner in action**, which means the **original scanner must be recognizable within the hologram**. Therefore, its core identity features must be preserved in the depiction inside the hologram. These include:
- The distinct **black and gray color scheme**
- The **curved top cover** with the Fujitsu logo
- The **open ADF tray** holding multiple documents
- The **control panel with specific button layout** (including green power light)
- The **bristle roller array** under the scanning bed
- The **branding "Fujitsu fi-7160"** on the top left

These are essential for identifying the device as the same model. If these are altered beyond recognition in the hologram, the intended reference fails.

Functional/logical association elements: The **functionality** of the scanner (e.g., feeding documents via ADF) must be logically depicted in the hologram. Even if stylized, the **action of scanning documents** must be shown, so the presence of documents in the ADF and their movement through the machine must be retained in some form. The **logical relationship between the scanner and its use** (i.e., processing paper) cannot be removed without losing meaning.

Non-modified element deduction: After excluding all allowed changes (outer packaging, colors, materials, etc.), the remaining elements that must be preserved are those **specifically required to appear in the hologram**. These are not just decorative but serve as **reference points** for what the packaging contains. Therefore, even though the main object is replaced, its **visual identity in the holographic display** must be faithful.

Preservation Targets List:
- The Fujitsu fi-7160 model designation and logo on the top left
- The open ADF tray containing multiple documents (boarding pass, receipt, payment slip)
- The presence of the control panel with Menu, Stop/Clear, Scan/Enter, Power, and directional buttons
- The green illuminated power button
- The bristle roller array beneath the scanning glass
- The black and light gray color scheme of the scanner body
- The arrangement and type of documents in the ADF (including visible text like "Receipt", "Payment Slip", "Boarding Pass")
- The position and orientation of the scanner in the holographic display (side view, slightly angled)
