### Step 1: Description of Reference Image and Allowed Changes List
**Description of Reference Image:**  
The key details include two single beds placed parallel with matching quilted bedding featuring a patchwork design of pink, green, and white geometric and floral patterns. Each bed has a decorative pillow in magenta and teal respectively. Between the beds is a small white nightstand holding a vase with a vibrant pink flower. Two framed wall art pieces hang above the beds. The room has a simple, cozy atmosphere with a soft green wall.

**Thinking Process:**  
From the instructions, the only specified transformation is converting the image into a watercolor illustration style while keeping the bedding pattern intact. The instruction implies that other aspects, such as the room layout, furniture placement, and color scheme, should remain consistent.

**Allowed Changes List:**
- The overall image form can be converted into a watercolor illustration style, altering textures to give a soft hand-painted look.
- Colors may shift slightly, but the main hues and pattern integrity must be maintained.

### Step 2: Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged
**Thinking Process:**
- **Core Recognition Elements:** The distinct patchwork pattern of the bedding is crucial for maintaining the identity of the image. Losing this makes the image lose its recognizable bedding design.
- **Functional/Logical Association Elements:** The spatial arrangement (two beds, nightstand centered, and wall art above) must stay unchanged to retain the room's logical design.
- **Remaining Elements:** Details like the color of the pillows and the vase with flowers are minor yet contribute to the overall visual consistency and should be kept.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
- Bedding patchwork patterns  
- Positions of the two beds and nightstand  
- Wall art positions  
- Pillow colors  
- Vase and flower details
