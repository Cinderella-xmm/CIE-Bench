Description of reference image: The image is Leonardo da Vinci's "The Last Supper," depicting Jesus Christ and the Twelve Apostles seated around a long table in a room with an Italian Renaissance architectural feel. Jesus is central, calm, and surrounded by the apostles who display varied emotions and gestures. The table is covered with a white cloth, scattered with bread, dishes, and drinks. The background features large windows showing distant mountains under a clear sky, flanked by symmetrical wall panels. The scene is painted with muted earth tones, emphasizing depth and perspective.
