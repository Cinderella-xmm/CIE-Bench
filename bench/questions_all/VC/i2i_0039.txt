Description of reference image: The subject is a polar bear with two cubs standing on an ice floe. The adult polar bear stands protectively behind the cubs, while the cubs appear to be interacting closely. The ice floe has visible textures of snow and ice, and the backdrop features the dark blue ocean water. The lighting creates natural highlights and shadows on the ice and bears, giving the scene a realistic feel.

### Step 1 - Allowed Changes List:
Specific element 1 that allows for changes: Slightly cool the color tone of the entire image.
Specific element 2 that allows for changes: Add text ("Only Ice Left. Nowhere to Go.") in the top right corner.
Specific element 3 that allows for changes: Add an organization logo and website at the bottom of the image.
Specific element 4 that allows for changes: Adjustments to the overall brightness and contrast for a cooler appearance, aligning with the climate crisis theme.

### Step 2 - Preservation Targets List:
Thinking process:
Core recognition elements: The polar bear family (adult bear with cubs) is the central focus. The distinctive white fur, their postures, and the ice environment are integral to identifying the subject matter. Changing these aspects would undermine the imagery's purpose of illustrating climate impact on wildlife. 

Functional/logical association elements: The spatial arrangement of the bears and the ice floe should remain intact. This preserves the logical connection between the subjects and their environment, which is crucial for conveying the message effectively.

Remaining elements: Details like the texture of the ice and the natural lighting should also stay consistent because they contribute to the image's authenticity and emotional impact.

Preservation Targets List:
(Element 1 that should be maintained: Polar bear family composition – adult bear, two cubs, and their positions relative to each other.)
(Element 2 that should be maintained: Textures and natural coloration of ice and snow.)
(Element 3 that should be maintained: Presence and positioning of the ocean backdrop.)
(Element 4 that should be maintained: Natural lighting and shadow effects on the bears and ice.)

### Step 3 - Generated Questions:

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The polar bear family's composition is critical for the image's identity. The cubs' interaction under the adult bear’s watch is a key visual component that illustrates familial protection amid adversity, essential for the climate crisis narrative.
    Question: Is the adult polar bear positioned behind the two cubs, with the cubs visibly interacting with each other?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The texture of the ice is a distinctive environmental feature that helps emphasize the Arctic setting and the potential impact of climate change on this habitat. Loss of detail here would weaken the image's realism and thematic depth.
    Question: Are the detailed textures of the ice and snow, including ridges and smooth patches, still present in the image?
    Choices: Yes, No  
    A: Yes

    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The ocean serves as a contextual backdrop that further sets the scene in the Arctic. Its presence is necessary to establish the location and reinforce the urgency of the climate crisis narrative.
    Question: Is the ocean backdrop visible behind the ice floe, showing the dark blue water?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The natural lighting adds realism and enhances the image's emotional impact. Retaining the interplay of light and shadow on the bears and ice is crucial for maintaining the authenticity of the scene.
    Question: Are the natural lighting and shadow effects on the polar bears and ice preserved in the edited image?
    Choices: Yes, No  
    A: Yes

{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The white fur of the bears is a defining characteristic that ensures the audience recognizes them immediately. Preserving this feature is vital for maintaining the image's core identity and message.
    Question: Do the polar bears retain their distinct white fur coloration, with no significant alteration to their iconic appearance?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
