      "thinking_process": "The blue irises in the eyes are a distinctive and unique visual feature in the original image. They contribute significantly to facial recognition and identity. If replaced or altered (e.g., changed to gray or green), the subject would no longer match the original. This is a core identification element, making its retention essential. Therefore, the question directly targets the presence of the original eye color, which is not mentioned for change in the instruction.",
      "question": "Are the irises of the eyes still blue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The facial structure—including the shape of the nose, jawline, and forehead—is a primary identifier of the individual. Any significant alteration (e.g., changing nose shape or jaw angle) would result in a different person. Since the instruction does not mention modifying facial features, they must be preserved. This is a core identity element.",
      "question": "Is the facial structure, including the nose, jawline, and cheekbones, unchanged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The posture—specifically the slight leftward angle of the body and forward-facing head—is a key compositional element. It defines the spatial relationship between the subject and viewer. The instruction does not specify altering pose, so it must remain consistent. Changing it would affect the scene’s coherence and subject identity.",
      "question": "Is the subject positioned with a slight leftward turn of the body while facing forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The arm position—specifically the arms resting at the sides, with the right shoulder slightly forward due to the angle—defines the body language and balance. This is part of the original pose and contributes to visual consistency. Not mentioned for change, so it must be preserved.",
      "question": "Are both arms positioned naturally at the sides of the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The skin tone appears to be a natural, light complexion with subtle shading. This is a minor detail but contributes to realism and identity. Since no instruction mentions altering skin tone or texture, it should remain unchanged. Though less critical than facial features, it supports visual coherence.",
      "question": "Is the skin tone consistent with a natural light complexion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The original image shows the subject’s lips closed in a neutral expression. This is a specific facial detail that contributes to emotional tone and identity. Since no instruction mentions altering expression, it must be preserved. This is a minor but identifiable feature.",
      "question": "Are the lips closed in a neutral expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
