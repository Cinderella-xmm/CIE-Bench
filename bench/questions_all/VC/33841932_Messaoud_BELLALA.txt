**Step 1 – Analyze the editing instructions and determine allowed changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a nighttime cityscape featuring a cluster of modern skyscrapers illuminated against a dark sky. The central building is a tall, curved tower with a golden glow, its surface composed of horizontal bands of light that create a shimmering effect. To its left stands a uniquely angled skyscraper with a sharp, asymmetrical top, partially lit in warm tones. Adjacent to it is a rectangular high-rise with a stepped design and glowing windows. On the right side of the frame, several other towers are visible, including one with vertical white light strips and another topped with a bright yellow sign. The buildings are reflected in calm water in the foreground, creating a mirror-like effect. A small red buoy floats in the water near the center, slightly off-center from the skyline. The overall lighting emphasizes warm golds and yellows from the buildings, contrasted with cooler blues and whites in some structures. The scene is static, with no visible movement or people.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction states: *"Transform the illuminated cityscape into a set of four cartoon-style metal bookmarks, each shaped like the distinct skyscrapers. Etch lively outlines and glaze the bookmarks with shimmering gold and silver hues. Clip them onto an open book with doodles of stars and waves, each representing a dynamic skyline view."*

This indicates:
- **Subject transformation**: The entire cityscape (skyscrapers) is to be reimagined as *bookmarks*, meaning the physical form of the buildings will change.
- **Style transformation**: From realistic photography to *cartoon-style* metal bookmarks — this allows for stylistic exaggeration, simplification, and stylization.
- **Material transformation**: Buildings become *metal bookmarks*, so texture and material can change.
- **Color modification**: "Glazed with shimmering gold and silver hues" — color scheme can be altered, though the original warm golden glow may inform the new palette.
- **Scene replacement**: The original background (night sky, water, buoy) is replaced by an open book with doodles — so the environment is entirely changed.
- **Quantity adjustment**: Only *four* bookmarks are to be made, implying only four of the many buildings will be selected — thus not all buildings need to be preserved.

However, the instruction specifies that each bookmark is "shaped like the distinct skyscrapers", which means the **distinctive shapes** of the original buildings must be preserved in silhouette or outline.

Also, the phrase "each representing a dynamic skyline view" implies that the **core visual identity** of the skyline elements must be recognizable in the transformed bookmarks.

Therefore, while the **form**, **material**, **color**, **background**, and **number** of elements can change, the **iconic silhouettes and structural identities** of the selected skyscrapers must remain intact.

---

**Allowed Changes List:**  
- The overall form of the buildings (from real structures to bookmarks)  
- The material (from glass/steel to metal)  
- The color scheme (to gold/silver glazing)  
- The background (from night skyline over water to open book with doodles)  
- The number of buildings depicted (only four selected)  
- The lighting style (from ambient city lights to cartoonish shimmer)  
- The presence of non-core elements such as the buoy, water reflections, distant lights, and sky gradient

**Step 2 – Determine the elements that should remain unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
We now identify what **must not change**, based on the original image and the instruction’s constraints.

**Core recognition elements:**  
Even though the buildings are being transformed into bookmarks, the instruction says “each shaped like the distinct skyscrapers.” This means the **unique architectural silhouettes** must be preserved. These are the core identifiers of the buildings and essential for recognition. For example:
- The **curved, tapered golden tower** (center) is a distinctive landmark.
- The **asymmetrical, angular skyscraper** (left) has a unique profile.
- The **rectangular stepped building** (next to it) has a clear geometric shape.
- The **tower with vertical light strips** (right) has a distinct pattern.

These forms are critical for maintaining the identity of the original skyline. If these shapes are lost or distorted, the bookmarks would not represent the original buildings.

**Functional/logical association elements:**  
There is no functional interaction in the original image (e.g., no actions), but the **spatial relationship between the buildings** is implied in the skyline. However, since the instruction selects only four and arranges them as bookmarks clipped to a book, the spatial layout does not need to be preserved. Thus, relative positions are allowed to change.

**Non-modified element deduction:**  
After excluding allowed changes (form, material, background, etc.), the remaining elements that must be retained are:
- The **distinctive silhouette** of each selected skyscraper
- The **key architectural features** that define their identity (e.g., curve, angle, step, light strip)
- The **relative proportion** of key features (e.g., height ratio, width at base vs. top)

These are necessary to ensure the bookmarks are recognizable as representations of the original buildings.

Thus, even though the style and context change, the **essential shape and defining structural characteristics** of the selected buildings must remain.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
- The curved, tapering silhouette of the central golden skyscraper  
- The sharp, asymmetrical top of the leftmost angular skyscraper  
- The stepped rectangular form of the adjacent building  
- The vertical light strip pattern on the right-side skyscraper  
- The overall proportion and scale relationships within each building's structure (e.g., base width vs. height)

**Step 3 – Generate yes/no questions based on key visual elements**

Q1:  
Thinking process: The central golden skyscraper is the most prominent feature due to its unique curved, tapering shape and golden illumination. Its silhouette is the core identifier of the skyline. If this shape is altered or simplified beyond recognition (e.g., straightened or flattened), the bookmark would no longer represent the original building. Therefore, preserving the curved tapering form is essential for identity retention. This is a key visual element that defines the building’s uniqueness and public recognition in the original image.  
Question: Does the bookmark retain the curved, tapering silhouette of the central golden skyscraper?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The leftmost skyscraper has a distinctive angular, asymmetrical top that sets it apart from others. This sharp cut-off and tilt are iconic features that define its identity. If this shape is smoothed or symmetrized, the building would lose its recognizability. Since the instruction requires bookmarks "shaped like the distinct skyscrapers," this specific silhouette must be preserved. It is a core structural detail directly tied to the building’s identity.  
Question: Does the bookmark retain the sharp, asymmetrical top of the leftmost skyscraper?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The adjacent building to the left of the central tower has a stepped, rectangular form with clearly defined horizontal layers. This stepped design is a key architectural feature that distinguishes it from the surrounding towers. If this stepped pattern is removed or flattened, the building would not be identifiable. As part of the "distinct skyscrapers" to be represented, this structural detail must be preserved in the bookmark version.  
Question: Does the bookmark retain the stepped, rectangular form of the building next to the central tower?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The skyscraper on the right side of the skyline features vertical light strips running up its facade. This pattern is a defining visual characteristic that makes it distinguishable from others. Even if the color changes to silver or gold, the presence and alignment of these vertical lines must be preserved to maintain the building’s identity. Since the instruction specifies "distinct skyscrapers," this pattern is a core identifying element.  
Question: Does the bookmark retain the vertical light strip pattern on the right-side skyscraper?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The proportion of the buildings—such as the height-to-width ratio and the narrowing of the central tower—contributes to their recognizability. For example, the central tower is significantly taller than it is wide at the base, and it tapers upward. Altering this proportion would distort the building’s identity. While minor scaling adjustments may be acceptable, the fundamental scale relationship must be maintained for accurate representation. This is a secondary but important detail for visual coherence.  
Question: Does the bookmark preserve the height-to-width ratio and tapering proportion of the central skyscraper?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The base of the central golden skyscraper is wider than the upper portion, forming a stable foundation. This widening at the base is a key structural feature that contributes to its visual balance and identity. If the base is narrowed or eliminated, the building would appear unstable and unrecognizable. Though less prominent than the curve, this foundational shape is part of the building’s core form and must be retained.  
Question: Does the bookmark retain the wider base of the central skyscraper compared to its upper section?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The original image includes a small red buoy floating in the water, positioned slightly off-center. While this is a minor environmental detail, it adds depth and realism to the scene. However, since the instruction replaces the entire scene with a book and doodles, this element is not required to be preserved. It is not part of the "distinct skyscrapers" and is not referenced in the transformation. Thus, it is not a preservation target.  
Question: Is the red buoy present in the final image?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: No  
Weight: 1  

Note: This question is included to confirm that minor environmental details are correctly omitted, reinforcing the understanding that only building forms are preserved.
