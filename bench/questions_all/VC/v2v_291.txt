### Step 1 - Description of Reference Image and Allowed Changes List:

**Description of reference image:** The image features a hippopotamus and a rabbit positioned side by side on a sandy ground with sparse grass. The hippo is large, with a grayish-brown skin tone, visible wrinkles, and a relaxed posture. The rabbit is small, with light brown fur and upright ears, sitting calmly beside the hippo. Both animals appear calm and are facing forward. The background is a natural outdoor setting with earthy tones.

**Thinking process:** The instructions specify transforming the image into a 3D cartoon style with gentle lighting and cozy tones. The scene's background can be replaced with a nature-inspired backdrop. The positioning of the animals can be adjusted to stand side by side. Additional elements like stats, skill bars, a title banner, and a nameplate can be added. However, the core identity and relationship between the hippo and rabbit must be retained.

**Allowed Changes List:**
- Convert the hippo and rabbit into a 3D cartoon style.
- Adjust the lighting and color tones to be gentle and cozy.
- Replace the background with a nature-inspired setting.
- Add new elements like stats, skill bars, title banner, and nameplate.
- Adjust the posture of the animals to stand side by side.

### Step 2 - Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged:

**Thinking process:** Core recognition elements include the distinct physical characteristics of the hippo and rabbit, such as the hippo's large size, wrinkled skin, and the rabbit's small size and upright ears. Functional/logical elements include their proximity and orientation, which convey harmony and friendship. Remaining elements like the natural earthy tones and the animals' calm demeanor should also be retained for visual coherence.

**Preservation Targets List:**
- The hippo's large size and wrinkled skin texture.
- The rabbit's small size and upright ears.
- The proximity and orientation of the hippo and rabbit.
- The calm demeanor of both animals.
- The earthy tones reflecting their natural environment.
