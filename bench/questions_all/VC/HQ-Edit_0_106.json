      "thinking_process": "The lion’s **mane shape** is a core identification feature distinguishing it from other big cats. Even in silhouette, the **broad, rounded outline of the mane** around the head and neck is essential for recognizing it as a male lion. Loss of this shape would make the silhouette unidentifiable as a lion, especially in a symbolic movie poster context. This is a 3-point element because it is the primary visual identifier of the subject.",
      "question": "Does the lion’s silhouette retain the distinct, wide, rounded mane shape around its head and neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The **body posture** — specifically the front legs planted forward and the rear legs slightly bent — conveys power and readiness, reinforcing the \"king\" theme. This stance is a functional element of the lion’s dominance and must be preserved to maintain the intended narrative. Altering it would weaken the visual impact of authority. It is a 2-point element because it is crucial for conveying behavior and status.",
      "question": "Is the lion depicted with its front legs forward and rear legs bent, maintaining a poised, dominant stance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The **head orientation** — slightly turned toward the viewer — creates engagement and focus. This is a key compositional choice in the original image, allowing direct connection with the audience. Even in silhouette, this turn must be preserved to maintain the sense of awareness and regality. It is a 2-point element due to its importance in storytelling and visual interaction.",
      "question": "Is the lion’s head turned slightly toward the viewer, rather than fully in profile?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The **presence of grass in the foreground** is a minor but important environmental cue. Though texture may be enhanced, the **existence of grass** anchors the scene and provides depth. Removing it would make the foreground too bare and disrupt the savannah context. It is a 1-point element because it supports coherence without being core to identity.",
      "question": "Is there grass present in the foreground beneath the lion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The **presence of acacia trees** in the background, even if stylized into angular silhouettes, maintains the African savannah context. Their inclusion ensures thematic consistency. Removing them would eliminate a key environmental marker. This is a 1-point element because it is a contextual detail, not a core identity feature.",
      "question": "Are acacia trees visible in the background, either as natural forms or stylized silhouettes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The **lion’s position in the foreground**, occupying the central lower half of the frame, is essential for visual dominance. Moving it to the side or background would undermine the “king” theme. This spatial relationship is a logical association element and must be preserved. It is a 2-point element due to its role in composition and narrative.",
      "question": "Is the lion positioned in the foreground, centered and large in scale relative to the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
