Description of reference image: The image depicts a serene coastal scene where a horse grazes on grass near the shoreline. The horse has a brown coat with a darker mane and tail, positioned in profile as it feeds. In the background, a calm sea stretches towards the horizon, with a white house visible on an elevated landmass across the water. Trees surround the house, and the sky above is overcast with soft, diffused lighting. The ground consists of sandy terrain mixed with patches of grass.

Thinking process:  
The editing instructions specify transforming a worker into a chibi-style 3D cartoon character with distinct attributes, placing this new character in a low-poly construction scene. However, there is no worker or construction scene present in the given image. Therefore, we need to focus on ensuring the horse’s characteristics and the coastal backdrop are preserved and assessed against the editing instructions.  

### Allowed Changes List:  
- The worker character can be transformed into a chibi-style 3D cartoon with specific clothing and accessories.  
- The scene can be replaced with a low-poly construction site with a small crane and a simplified light gray background.  
- The proportions, positions, and composition ratios of elements can be adjusted.  

### Step 2- Determine the elements that should remain unchanged  
Thinking process:  
- **Core recognition elements**: The horse’s distinctive brown coat, grazing posture, and natural habitat (coastal environment) are critical for maintaining its identity.  
- **Functional/logical association elements**: The horse’s position relative to the sea and grass maintains the logical coherence of a grazing coastal animal.  
- **Remaining elements based on visual coherence**: Details such as the white house in the distance and the calm sea contribute to the scene's overall ambiance and should be retained.

### Preservation Targets List:  
- Brown coat and dark mane of the horse  
- Grazing posture of the horse  
- Coastal environment (sea and grassy shore)  
- White house in the background
