**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is the Great Sphinx of Giza, depicted in profile facing right, with a human head wearing a traditional nemes headdress featuring horizontal stripes and a uraeus (cobra) at the forehead. The body is that of a recumbent lion carved from limestone, showing weathered textures and layered erosion patterns typical of ancient stone monuments. The Sphinx is positioned on a raised platform, partially surrounded by sand, with its front paws clearly visible and resting on the ground. In the background, to the right, stands one of the pyramids of Giza, slightly out of focus, under a vivid sunset sky transitioning from deep orange near the horizon to purple and pink hues higher up. The sun is low on the horizon, casting a warm golden glow across the scene. A thick layer of clouds or mist lies beneath the Sphinx, creating an ethereal effect as if it floats above the clouds, with soft light reflecting off the cloud tops.

Thinking process:  
The editing instructions explicitly state transformations to the **Sphinx’s head**, **body**, **limbs**, and **paws**, including replacing the head with a radiant sun disc, adding golden wings, transforming limbs into flowing desert sands, and placing glowing ankhs on the paws. These are all structural modifications to the subject's form. The instruction does not mention altering the **pyramid** or **sky**, nor does it specify changing the **cloud layer**, **sun position**, or **overall atmospheric lighting**. Therefore, these environmental elements are implicitly retained unless contradicted.

Allowed Changes List:  
- The **head** of the Sphinx (to be replaced with a radiant sun disc adorned with hieroglyphic patterns)  
- The **body structure** (to include shimmering golden wings extending from the sides)  
- The **limbs** (to be infused with flowing desert sands cascading down)  
- The **paws** (to have symbolic ankhs glowing in azure)  
- The **overall form and texture** of the Sphinx’s body can be altered as long as the transformation aligns with the described mythical solar deity concept

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements must be preserved if they are essential for identifying the original subject or scene. The **Great Sphinx** is defined by its **iconic hybrid form**: human head with lion body. While the head will be replaced, the **original spatial relationship** between the Sphinx and the pyramid, the **presence of the pyramid**, and the **position of the sun at sunset** are critical for maintaining contextual authenticity. These are not mentioned in the instructions as being changed, so they must remain. Additionally, the **cloud layer beneath the Sphinx** contributes to the surreal atmosphere but is not specified for modification—thus, its presence and positioning should be preserved for visual coherence.

Functional/logical association elements:  
The **Sphinx's orientation (facing right)** and **position relative to the pyramid** establish a known geographic and symbolic layout. Changing this would disrupt the logical spatial relationship tied to the real-world site. The **sun’s placement at the horizon** is key to the sunset ambiance and lighting dynamics; altering it would contradict the intended mood and time of day.

Non-modified element deduction:  
All unmentioned aspects of the scene—such as the **color gradient of the sky**, **texture of the clouds**, **shape and silhouette of the pyramid**, **erosion patterns on the Sphinx’s base**, and **the reflective glow on the clouds**—must be retained because they are not specified for change and contribute to the overall realism and consistency of the scene. Even though the Sphinx itself is transformed, the surrounding environment must stay true to the original to maintain visual grounding.

Preservation Targets List:  
- The **pyramid in the background** (silhouette, position, and shape)  
- The **sun at the horizon** (position, size, and luminance)  
- The **cloud layer beneath the Sphinx** (presence, thickness, coloration, and reflection of light)  
- The **orientation of the Sphinx (facing right)**  
- The **sky gradient** (orange to purple/pink transition)  
- The **base of the Sphinx and surrounding terrain** (including eroded stone layers and partial sand coverage)

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

Q1:  
Thinking process: The **pyramid** is a core landmark in the original image and serves as a definitive identifier of the location (Giza). Its presence and silhouette are essential for situational recognition. Removing or altering it would sever the connection to the real-world context, making the image unrecognizable as a depiction of the Giza plateau. This is a 3-point element due to its role in identity and location verification.  
Question: Is the pyramid visible in the background to the right of the Sphinx, with a clear triangular silhouette against the sunset sky?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The **sun’s position at the horizon** is central to the lighting and mood of the scene. It defines the time of day (sunset) and casts directional light across the Sphinx and clouds. Altering its position or removing it would destroy the atmospheric integrity and thematic intent. This is a 3-point element because it governs the entire lighting scheme and temporal setting.  
Question: Is the sun positioned low on the horizon, directly behind the Sphinx, emitting a bright circular glow?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The **cloud layer beneath the Sphinx** creates a surreal, elevated appearance and reflects the warm light of the sunset. Its presence is crucial for the dreamlike quality of the image. Removing or significantly altering it would eliminate this key visual effect and disrupt the balance between earth and sky. This is a 2-point element as it enhances the scene’s atmosphere without being a primary identifier.  
Question: Is there a dense layer of clouds below the Sphinx, appearing illuminated with orange and pink hues from the sunset?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The **Sphinx’s orientation (facing right)** is a defining feature of its iconic profile view. Changing this would alter the viewer’s perception and break continuity with established imagery. While the head will be replaced, the directionality remains part of the original composition and must be preserved for consistency. This is a 2-point element due to its importance in composition and perspective.  
Question: Is the Sphinx facing toward the right side of the image, with its profile visible?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The **sky gradient** from orange near the horizon to purple and pink higher up is a signature feature of the sunset lighting. It contributes to the emotional tone and visual harmony of the scene. Any deviation in color progression would make the image appear unnatural or inconsistent with the original. This is a 1-point element because it supports the aesthetic rather than identity.  
Question: Does the sky show a smooth gradient from warm orange near the horizon to cooler purple and pink tones at the top?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The **eroded stone base and layered texture of the Sphinx** are physical details that confirm its ancient, weathered nature. These textures are part of the original monument’s character and must remain even if the upper form is transformed. Losing them would make the structure appear unreal or digitally fabricated without historical grounding. This is a 1-point element due to its detail-level significance.  
Question: Are there visible horizontal erosion lines and layered textures on the lower portion of the Sphinx’s body?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The **partial sand coverage around the base of the Sphinx** reinforces its desert location and adds realism. This detail grounds the image in its environment and should not be removed, especially since the editing focuses on mythological enhancement rather than environmental abstraction. This is a 1-point element as it contributes to environmental authenticity.  
Question: Is there sand visible around the base of the Sphinx, particularly near the front paws and lower body?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1
