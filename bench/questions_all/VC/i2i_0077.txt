### Description of Reference Image:
The subject is a modern bathroom setup featuring a floating vanity cabinet with black drawers and a black stone countertop. The sink is a sleek, oval design with a black finish and is paired with a pair of metallic faucets. Above the sink is a rectangular mirror with a glowing orange backlight that illuminates the surrounding area. Two industrial-style bulbs hang on either side of the mirror, contributing to the moody ambiance. The walls are painted a muted gray with minimalist lines and features, while a dark curtain partially covers a window that offers a view of greenery outside. On the windowsill sits a potted plant, and decorative items like small books and candles adorn the countertop.

**Remaining Elements per Visual Coherence:**
- Retain visual details like the shape of the sink and mirror, the clean lines of the floating cabinet, and the window's position to maintain coherence with the original image.
