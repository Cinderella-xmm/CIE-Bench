      "thinking_process": "The red flowers in the lower-left foreground are a distinctive visual feature that adds vibrant color contrast to the otherwise green and gray scene. They are clearly visible and localized, serving as a key identifier of the tropical flora present. Their removal or alteration would disrupt the ecological authenticity of the image and reduce visual coherence. Since they are not mentioned in the editing instructions, they must be retained. This is a core detail that anchors the scene and differentiates it from other waterfalls. Losing this feature would compromise the image’s identity as a specific tropical setting.",

It is a clear, identifiable shape that contributes to the immersive quality of the image. As it is not referenced in the editing instructions, it must remain unchanged. Its presence reinforces the perspective and natural framing of the scene. Removing it would alter the composition significantly.",

Their unique fan-shaped structure and light green coloration distinguish them from other foliage. They are not mentioned for modification and are critical for maintaining the jungle atmosphere. Their absence would make the environment feel less authentic.",

It provides geological context and visual continuity. Although the waterfall is being transformed, the rock must remain to preserve the source location. Its texture and position are key to the scene’s realism.",
