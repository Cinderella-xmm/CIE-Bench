      "thinking_process": "The clock face is the most critical identifying feature of a clocktower. Its presence, shape, and markings (Roman numerals) are essential for recognition. The instruction specifies restoring damaged portions but does not mention altering the clock itself. Therefore, the clock face must remain visually identical in position, shape, and content. The use of Roman numerals is a key stylistic and functional detail that defines the historical aesthetic. Losing this would fundamentally change the tower’s identity. Hence, this is a 3-point question.",
      "question": "Is the clock face present with Roman numerals I through XII arranged in a circle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The position of the clock face directly above the central arch is a key compositional and functional element. It establishes the tower’s symmetry and purpose. Moving or repositioning it would disrupt the architectural logic and visual balance. Since the instruction requires alignment with the original historical aesthetic, the relative placement must be preserved. This is a 3-point element due to its role in structural and functional identity.",
      "question": "Is the clock face located directly above the central arched opening?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The pointed gable roof with finials at the corners is an iconic Gothic architectural feature that contributes to the tower’s distinct silhouette. It is a core recognition element that distinguishes this tower from others. The instruction requires preserving the historical aesthetic, so this ornamental top must remain unaltered. Changing its shape or removing the finials would compromise the tower’s identity. This is a 3-point question.",
      "question": "Does the top of the tower feature a pointed gable with finials at each corner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The side arched windows are integral to the tower’s symmetrical design and Gothic style. They are not damaged and thus must remain unchanged. Their presence contributes to the overall architectural rhythm and balance. Altering their shape or position would break the visual harmony. While not as central as the clock, they are important scene elements that support the historical aesthetic. This is a 2-point question.",
      "question": "Are there two arched windows on the left and right sides of the tower, positioned symmetrically below the clock face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The texture and color of the intact stone surface are crucial for maintaining the tower’s aged, weathered appearance. The instruction requires the restored version to appear \"enduring\" and historically authentic, meaning the original material qualities must be preserved. The rough, cracked texture of the undamaged stone is a key visual detail that conveys age and authenticity. Changing this would make the restoration look artificial. This is a 2-point question as it supports the overall aesthetic consistency.",
      "question": "Is the undamaged stone surface of the tower uniformly light gray with visible cracks and rough texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The upper arch above the clock face is structurally intact and forms part of the tower’s architectural framework. It is a key design element that frames the clock and contributes to the vertical composition. Since it is not damaged, it must remain unchanged. Its preservation ensures continuity in the tower’s design language. This is a 2-point question due to its importance in architectural coherence.",
      "question": "Is there an intact arched opening directly above the clock face, forming a decorative frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The overall vertical silhouette of the tower, including its height-to-width ratio and tiered structure, is a core visual identifier. The instruction requires the design to appear \"complete\" and \"enduring,\" implying that the original proportions must be maintained. Altering the height or width would distort the tower’s identity. This is a 2-point question as it relates to structural integrity and visual balance.",
      "question": "Does the tower maintain a tall, narrow vertical profile with distinct horizontal divisions at the base, middle, and top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
