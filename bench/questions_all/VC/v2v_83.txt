### Step 1 - Description of Reference Image and Allowed Changes List:

**Description of Reference Image:**  
The subject is a young individual wearing a red cap, a black shirt under a beige jacket, and has a confident stance. Above their head floats a skateboard with a vibrant design featuring a sun motif in orange and yellow, along with wavy lines in blue, pink, and purple. The skateboard is positioned diagonally against a backdrop of a clear blue sky with minimal clouds. The subject appears to be outdoors, possibly in a casual setting.

**Thinking Process:**  
The instructions specify transforming the image into a 3D cartoon aesthetic with soft lighting and a vivid sense of personality. The scene is to be replaced with an urban background and a clear sky. Skill stats and a title banner are to be added. The skateboard's design and the subject's attire are key elements that should be retained.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
1. Transform the subject and skateboard into a 3D cartoon style.  
2. Replace the current background with an urban scenery and clear sky.  
3. Add skill stats, a title banner, and a nameplate.  
4. Adjust the color palette to include warm highlights and dynamic tones.  

### Step 2 - Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged:

**Thinking Process:**  
Core recognition elements include the skateboard's vibrant design and the subject's attire, as these define the skater persona. Functional/logical elements include the skateboard's position relative to the subject, as it conveys the skater's connection to the board. Remaining elements like the subject's facial features and posture contribute to visual coherence.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
1. Skateboard's vibrant design with sun motif and wavy lines.  
2. Subject's attire (red cap, black shirt, beige jacket).  
3. Skateboard's position above the subject's head.  
4. Subject's facial features and posture.
