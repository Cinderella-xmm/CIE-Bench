      "thinking_process": "The four dragons, each occupying one quadrant of the cover, are the most prominent and iconic elements of the design. Their presence, number, and spatial distribution are key to identifying the artwork as a traditional Chinese cosmological motif. Changing their number or removing any one would fundamentally alter the identity of the piece. Thus, preserving all four dragons in their respective quadrants is essential.",
      "question": "Are there exactly four dragons, one in each quadrant of the cover?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The central circular compass with multiple concentric rings and inscribed text is the functional core of the design. It represents a traditional Chinese astrological or feng shui instrument. Its existence and structure are crucial to the object’s identity. Removing or distorting this feature would destroy the symbolic and informational intent of the original.",
      "question": "Is there a central circular compass composed of concentric rings with inscribed characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The star-shaped pointer at the center of the compass is a distinctive functional detail that anchors the design. It resembles a compass needle or celestial indicator, reinforcing the navigational/astrological theme. Its presence is necessary for maintaining the intended symbolism and visual balance.",
      "question": "Is there a star-shaped pointer located at the center of the compass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The symmetrical layout of the dragons around the compass is a defining compositional feature. Each dragon faces inward, creating a balanced and harmonious design. Disrupting this symmetry would break the visual logic and cultural symbolism of the piece.",
      "question": "Are the dragons arranged symmetrically around the central compass, with each facing toward the center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The division of the cover into four quadrants by cross-shaped lines is a structural element that organizes the dragons and the compass. This grid-like framework is integral to the design’s clarity and balance. Altering or removing it would affect the overall composition and legibility.",
      "question": "Are the dragons separated by cross-shaped lines dividing the cover into four equal quadrants?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The presence of Chinese characters within the concentric rings of the compass is a key detail that conveys cultural and functional information. These inscriptions are likely related to zodiac signs, directions, or elemental cycles. Their retention ensures the authenticity and interpretive depth of the design.",
      "question": "Are there Chinese characters inscribed within the concentric rings of the central compass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The posture and directionality of each dragon — such as coiled bodies, raised heads, and clawed limbs — contribute to their dynamic expression and symbolic meaning. While color and material may change, the specific pose of each dragon must be preserved to maintain visual continuity and cultural accuracy.",
      "question": "Do the dragons have coiled bodies with raised heads and extended claws, consistent with traditional Chinese dragon depictions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
