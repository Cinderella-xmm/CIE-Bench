      "thinking_process": "The text \"NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK, WASHINGTON, D.C.\" is a core identifying feature of the original postcard, anchoring the image to a specific institution and location. It is not mentioned in the editing instruction as something to be removed or altered, and its removal would sever the historical and contextual identity of the image. This is a key textual element that defines the image’s provenance and must be preserved. Loss of this text would make the image unrecognizable as originating from the National Zoological Park, hence it is a 3-point element.",

Although the subject is being reimagined, the caption remains essential for contextual continuity. Removing or altering this label would mislead viewers about the original subject, even if transformed. It is a key textual anchor and therefore carries high weight.",

      "thinking_process": "The straw-covered ground is a defining environmental detail in the original image, providing a naturalistic setting for the animal. It is not mentioned in the editing instruction to be changed, and maintaining it ensures visual consistency between the original and edited versions. While whimsical elements could be layered over it, its presence as a textured ground layer is crucial for grounding the scene. This is a major environmental element, hence a 2-point question.",

      "thinking_process": "The dark green-brown background serves as a neutral, shaded enclosure typical of zoo exhibits. It is not referenced in the editing instruction, and replacing it without cause would disrupt the original setting. While the whimsical creature might emit light, the background should remain consistent unless specified. This is a key scene element supporting realism and context.",
      "question": "Is the background behind the warthog a dark green-brown gradient, resembling an indoor or shaded enclosure?",
