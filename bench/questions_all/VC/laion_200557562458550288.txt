**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

Description of reference image:  
The subject is a short-sleeved cycling jersey displayed flat against a white background. The jersey features a color-blocked design with a dominant white base on the left side and a royal blue panel on the right side, separated by a vertical white stripe along the central zipper line. On the chest area of the blue panel, there is a large white five-pointed star centered above the placeholder text "YOUR NAME" in bold, white, uppercase letters. A red diagonal stripe runs from the lower left to the upper right across the torso, intersecting the word "DALLAS," which appears vertically in red capital letters on the left side of the jersey. The word "DALLAS" is repeated multiple times in faded gray lettering in a diagonal pattern across the white section. The sleeve on the left arm has a tricolor patch—blue, black, and red—resembling the Texas state flag. The bottom hem of the jersey has a black trim with a white inner lining. The garment includes a full-length front zipper and a high collar.

Thinking process:  
The editing instruction explicitly states:  
- Transform the **garment into an anthropomorphic cyclist character**, implying that the form of the jersey will be reinterpreted as a human-like figure (i.e., the jersey becomes a character).  
- Incorporate **facial features on the chest area where the star motif is located**, meaning the star will be replaced or modified to include eyes, mouth, etc.  
- Use the **existing color scheme**, so colors must remain consistent (white, blue, red, gray, black).  
- Add **stylized motion lines** around the character for a sense of speed.  
- Include a **tagline**: “Ride Like a Star!” in bold, diagonal typography at the bottom left.  
- Maintain a **structured yet energetic layout**.

From this, we deduce:

**Allowed Changes List:**  
- The **form of the jersey** can be transformed into an anthropomorphic character (i.e., the jersey becomes a cartoonish cyclist).  
- The **star motif** on the chest can be altered to include facial features (eyes, nose, mouth), replacing or modifying its original shape.  
- **New elements** such as motion lines and the tagline are allowed and required.  
- The **overall layout** can be adjusted to support the dynamic ad poster format.  
- The **background** can be changed to suit the promotional infographic style.  
- The **placement and orientation** of text like “DALLAS” and “YOUR NAME” may shift due to transformation into a character.

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

Thinking process:  
We now exclude the allowed changes to identify what **must be preserved** based on core recognition, functional logic, and visual coherence.

**Core recognition elements:**  
- The **color scheme** (white, royal blue, red, gray, black) is explicitly instructed to be retained. This is essential for brand identity and visual continuity.  
- The **"DALLAS" text** in red, both vertically and in faded gray repetition, is a key identifier of the jersey’s theme. It represents the city and is central to the design's identity. Even if repositioned, it must remain legible and present.  
- The **tricolor patch on the left sleeve** (blue, black, red) resembles the Texas flag and is a symbolic element tied to Dallas. Its presence reinforces regional identity and should not be removed.  
- The **red diagonal stripe** across the torso is a structural design element that contributes to the jersey’s visual balance and branding. It must remain.  
- The **"YOUR NAME" placeholder** is part of the customization feature and should be preserved in some form to maintain the product’s personalization intent.  

**Functional/logical association elements:**  
- The **full-length zipper** is a functional feature of cycling jerseys. While the transformation may abstract it, its presence or implication (e.g., vertical seam line) should be retained to preserve realism.  
- The **high collar** is a standard feature of cycling jerseys and contributes to the garment’s identity. If the character retains human proportions, the collar may be stylized but should still be recognizable.  

**Non-modified element deduction:**  
After excluding allowed changes (like transforming the star into a face), all other elements not mentioned as changeable must be retained. For example:  
- The **faded gray "DALLAS" text pattern** in the background is a recurring design motif and helps establish visual rhythm and identity.  
- The **black hem with white inner lining** is a detail that defines the jersey’s finish and should be preserved unless obscured by transformation.  
- The **short sleeves** and overall **silhouette** of the jersey are foundational to its identity as a cycling jersey. Even if anthropomorphized, the general outline should reflect the original structure.

Preservation Targets List:  
- The **color scheme** (white, royal blue, red, gray, black)  
- The **vertical red "DALLAS" text**  
- The **faded gray "DALLAS" text pattern**  
- The **tricolor sleeve patch** (blue, black, red)  
- The **red diagonal stripe** across the torso  
- The **"YOUR NAME" placeholder**  
- The **full-length front zipper** (or its visual representation)  
- The **high collar**  
- The **black hem with white inner lining**  
- The **short-sleeve structure**  
- The **overall jersey silhouette** (even if stylized)

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The vertical red "DALLAS" text is a core branding element, clearly visible and central to the jersey’s identity. It is distinct in color and placement, and removing or altering it would fundamentally change the product’s identity. As a primary textual identifier, its retention is critical for recognition.
    Question: Is the vertical red "DALLAS" text present on the left side of the jersey?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
