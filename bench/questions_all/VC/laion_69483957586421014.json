      "thinking_process": "The brand name \"WARING\" is the core identity element of the product. It is the most recognizable feature that links the appliance to its manufacturer. If this logo is omitted, altered in spelling, or changed in style, the product would no longer be identifiable as a Waring appliance. This is a trademarked identifier and must be preserved exactly as shown in the original image.",
      "question": "Is the brand name \"WARING\" displayed in bold white capital letters on a black rectangular plaque with a textured border?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The three control buttons—red \"OFF\", green \"ON\", and blue \"PULSE\"—are functional indicators that define the user interface of the appliance. Their specific colors and labels are essential for correct operation and identification. Changing any of these would misrepresent the product's controls and could lead to confusion in use or marketing.",
      "question": "Are the control buttons labeled \"OFF\" (red), \"ON\" (green), and \"PULSE\" (blue) arranged horizontally on the base?",

      "thinking_process": "The black processing bowl with its integrated handle is a defining structural feature of the food processor. It distinguishes this model from others and is essential for handling during use. The shape and placement of the handle are critical for ergonomics and must be preserved in any representation.",
      "question": "Does the processing bowl have a black handle attached to its left side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The transparent lid with the feed tube and pusher mechanism is a key functional component that allows ingredients to be added during operation. The visibility of the lid and the presence of the feed tube are essential for identifying the appliance’s purpose and design. Removing or altering this feature would misrepresent the product’s capabilities.",
      "question": "Is there a transparent lid covering the bowl with a vertical feed tube and a pusher mechanism visible at the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The vertical cylindrical feed tube is a distinctive design element that enables continuous feeding during processing. Its shape and position are crucial for understanding the appliance’s function. Any deviation from its original form would compromise the accuracy of the product representation.",
      "question": "Is the feed tube a tall, vertical cylinder extending upward from the center of the lid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The silver metallic base with black feet provides the foundation of the appliance and contributes to its professional aesthetic. The color contrast and material texture are important for visual consistency and brand identity. Altering the base color or removing the feet would change the product’s appearance significantly.",
      "question": "Is the base of the food processor silver metallic with black feet at the bottom corners?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The overall silhouette and proportions of the food processor are essential for maintaining its recognizability. Even if viewed from an isometric angle on packaging, the relative sizes of the base, bowl, and feed tube must remain accurate to preserve the product’s identity.",
      "question": "Does the food processor maintain the same proportional relationship between the base, bowl, and feed tube as shown in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
