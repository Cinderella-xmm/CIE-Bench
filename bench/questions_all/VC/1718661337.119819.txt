Description of reference image: The subject is a male figure resembling George Washington, standing in a three-quarter pose facing slightly to the right. He wears an 18th-century naval officer’s uniform composed of a dark blue coat with elaborate gold trim, including epaulettes on the shoulders, gold buttons arranged vertically down the front, and decorative piping along the edges of the lapels and cuffs. Beneath the coat is a cream-colored waistcoat with matching gold buttons and ruffled white cravat at the neck. His head is adorned with a tricorne hat, dark blue with gold braid and a small golden insignia (possibly a stylized "G" or fleur-de-lis) on the front. His powdered wig is styled in tight curls framing his face, typical of colonial-era fashion. In his right hand, he holds a small golden bell by its tassel, suspended from a ribbon. His left hand rests near his side. The background depicts a beach scene at sunset, with soft waves rolling onto the shore under a warm-hued sky transitioning from orange near the horizon to dusky purple above. The lighting is soft and directional, casting gentle shadows and highlighting the textures of the fabric and facial features.

Thinking process: First, analyze the instructions that clearly state what can be changed. The instruction says: “Transform the naval officer into a steampunk airship captain.” This indicates the **subject's identity and costume** are to be reimagined entirely — thus, the original uniform, hat, and accessories may be replaced. It explicitly states: “Replace the uniform with a brown leather trench coat, brass gears, and mechanical details” — so the current navy blue coat with gold trim is not to be retained. Similarly, “Substitute the bell with a gadget-like chronometer” — meaning the bell must be removed and replaced. “The backdrop should morph into a sky with airships and floating cities” — indicating the beach and ocean background must be altered. “Add goggles to his tricorne hat” — this implies the tricorne hat itself remains but gains new elements (goggles), so the hat shape is preserved but modified. Therefore, only elements **not mentioned for replacement or transformation** are candidates for retention. However, since the entire persona is being transformed, **only those visual features that are not explicitly changed and are necessary for continuity or identity** may be considered retainable. But crucially, no part of the subject’s **identity**, **costume**, or **background** is specified as *unchanged* — all are instructed to be transformed.

Allowed Changes List:
- Uniform (naval officer attire) → replaced with steampunk-style leather trench coat
- Bell → replaced with chronometer
- Background (beach at sunset) → replaced with sky featuring airships and floating cities
- Tricorne hat → modified with addition of goggles (hat shape may remain, but functionally altered)
- Overall character identity → transformed from historical figure to steampunk captain

Step 2 – Determine the elements that should remain unchanged  
Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements: The original image features George Washington, a historically iconic figure. His core recognition features include: the **white powdered wig**, the **tricorne hat**, the **facial structure** (specifically the prominent nose, jawline, and expression), and the **overall posture and stance**. These are essential for identifying him as Washington. However, the editing instruction does not require preservation of these features — it instructs a full transformation into a steampunk captain. Therefore, while these are core to the original identity, they are **not required to be retained** per the instruction. Thus, even though they are key identifiers, they fall within the scope of change unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Functional/logical association elements: The bell in his hand serves a symbolic or functional role — possibly signaling or ceremonial. Its replacement with a chronometer implies the **hand-held object’s function is being redefined**, but the **act of holding an object in the right hand** remains a logical gesture. Therefore, the **position and orientation of the right hand** (holding an object) may need to be preserved for consistency in posture, even if the object changes. Similarly, the **left hand resting near the body** is a compositional element that contributes to balance and formality; this posture may be retained for visual coherence.

Non-modified element deduction: After excluding all elements mentioned for change (uniform, bell, background, hat modifications), the only remaining elements are:
- The **face** (though not explicitly preserved, it may be retained in likeness if transformation is stylistic rather than complete substitution)
- The **wig** (powdered white hair style)
- The **posture** (three-quarter turn, hands positioned as described)
- The **general body shape and proportions**
- The **lighting direction and mood** (soft sunset glow)

However, since the instruction does not specify retaining any of these, and instead calls for a full transformation, **no element is strictly required to be preserved** unless it is implicitly tied to the subject’s identity or functional logic. Yet, in practice, even in transformations, certain structural elements like **hand positions, facial features, or body orientation** are often preserved to maintain continuity. Given that the instruction does not say “replace the face” or “change the pose,” we infer that **the basic human form, facial structure, and posture** are likely intended to remain consistent, especially if the transformation is a reinterpretation rather than a total rewrite.

Therefore, despite the transformation, the following elements should be retained due to their role in preserving **visual coherence and logical continuity**:
- The **right hand holding an object** (even if the object changes)
- The **left hand resting near the hip**
- The **three-quarter profile stance**
- The **facial features** (especially eyes, nose, mouth, and chin shape)
- The **white powdered wig** (as a defining trait of the era and identity, though potentially modified)
- The **tricorne hat shape** (since goggles are added to it, implying the hat remains)

Preservation Targets List:
- The position and orientation of the right hand (holding an object)
- The position and orientation of the left hand (resting near the body)
- The three-quarter frontal stance of the figure
- The facial features (eyes, nose, mouth, jawline)
- The white powdered wig (shape and color)
- The tricorne hat (basic shape and placement)

    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The white powdered wig is a defining feature of 18th-century elite figures like George Washington. Its presence and distinctive curled style are key to recognizing the historical context and identity of the subject. Even though the instruction allows modification of the hat with goggles, the wig itself is not mentioned for replacement. Retaining the wig ensures continuity between the original and transformed versions, anchoring the character in his historical roots. If the wig were completely removed or replaced, the figure would lose its identifiable link to the original subject, making it difficult to recognize as a reimagining of Washington. Thus, it is a core identity feature and must be preserved.
    Question: Is the white powdered wig with tightly curled sides still present on the figure's head?

    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The tricorne hat is an iconic symbol associated with the naval officer persona. Although the instruction specifies adding goggles to it, this implies the hat itself remains structurally intact. The hat’s shape — specifically its three-cornered silhouette with gold trim — is essential for maintaining visual continuity with the original image. Changing its form would break the connection between the old and new versions. Since the instruction modifies it rather than replaces it, the base shape must be preserved.
    Question: Does the figure wear a tricorne hat with a dark blue base and gold trim around the brim?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The right hand is shown holding a bell in the original image. While the bell is to be replaced with a chronometer, the hand's position — extended forward, fingers curled around an object — is a critical compositional element. Preserving this gesture maintains the figure’s posture and balance. Changing the hand’s position would disrupt the overall stance and suggest a different action or intent. Therefore, the spatial orientation of the right hand must be retained even if the object changes.
    Question: Is the right hand extended forward, gripping an object with the thumb and fingers wrapped around it?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The left hand rests near the body, contributing to the formal and balanced pose. This posture is consistent with historical portraiture and helps establish the figure’s dignified demeanor. Even though the object in the right hand changes, the left hand’s position remains unchanged unless specified. Altering it would unbalance the composition and deviate from the original stance. Hence, its position is important for visual coherence.
    Question: Is the left hand positioned near the lower torso, palm facing inward or downward?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The facial features — particularly the prominent nose, high cheekbones, and defined jawline — are key identifiers of George Washington. These features distinguish him from other historical figures and are central to his public recognition. Although the transformation may involve stylistic updates (like steampunk aesthetics), the underlying facial structure should remain consistent to preserve identity. Losing these features would result in a completely different person, undermining the purpose of a transformation rooted in the original.
    Question: Are the facial features including the straight nose, deep-set eyes, and strong jawline still visible and consistent with the original depiction?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The three-quarter stance — where the figure faces slightly to the right while the body is angled toward the viewer — is a classic portrait pose used to convey both dignity and approachability. This specific orientation is not mentioned for change, and altering it would fundamentally shift the composition. Maintaining this stance ensures that the transformation respects the original artistic framing and keeps the figure recognizable in terms of posture.
