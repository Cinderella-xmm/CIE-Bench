      "thinking_process": "The silver metallic casing with rounded corners and visible home button is the core identification feature of the smartphone model depicted. It distinguishes this device from other smartphones and is essential for recognizing its form. If these physical traits are removed or altered, the object loses its identity as a specific type of smartphone. Therefore, this is a key visual identifier and must be preserved.",
      "question": "Is the smartphone still a silver-colored device with a visible circular home button below the screen and rounded corners?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The laptop’s silver body with black keys and integrated trackpad is a defining characteristic of the device. Its keyboard layout and trackpad position are essential for identifying it as a MacBook-like device. Altering these would disrupt the functional and visual logic of the scene. This is a core structural element necessary for scene coherence.",
      "question": "Does the laptop retain its silver chassis, black keyboard, and visible trackpad below the keyboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The hand’s anatomical structure — including five fingers, visible fingernails, and natural grip — is essential for conveying the action of holding the phone. Any distortion or replacement (e.g., robotic hand) would violate the biological realism and functional context. This is a key element for maintaining logical interaction in the scene.",
      "question": "Is the hand anatomically correct with five fingers, visible fingernails, and a natural grip around the phone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The relative positioning of the phone above the laptop keyboard, with the hand holding it at a slight angle, establishes the spatial relationship central to the image’s narrative. Changing this would break the implied workflow and interaction context. This spatial logic is critical for scene consistency.",
      "question": "Is the smartphone held directly above the laptop keyboard, with the hand positioned over the trackpad area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The horizontal window blinds in the background provide environmental context and lighting cues. They are part of the office setting and contribute to the scene’s realism. While not the main subject, their presence maintains visual continuity and depth. Removing them would alter the ambient atmosphere.",
      "question": "Are horizontal window blinds visible in the background behind the laptop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Blue is explicitly required to be retained as a core accent color. The original image uses blue for charts, text, and UI elements on both screens. Even if the content changes, the color must persist to ensure visual coherence between the two devices. Losing blue would violate the instruction and break design continuity.",
      "question": "Is blue present as a dominant color on both the smartphone and laptop screens?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The screen shape of the smartphone — rectangular with rounded corners — is a fundamental design trait. Altering it (e.g., making it square or curved) would change its identity. This geometric form is essential for recognition and must be preserved even if the content is replaced.",
      "question": "Does the smartphone screen maintain a rectangular shape with rounded corners?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
