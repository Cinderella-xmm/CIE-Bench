**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a collection of makeup brushes arranged upright in a clear glass jar. The brushes have black handles with varying bristle shapes and colors—ranging from dark brown to light tan, with some showing a gradient or dual-tone effect. The jar is cylindrical and transparent, filled with white pearl-like beads up to about two-thirds of its height. A decorative lace band with a floral pattern in blue and white wraps around the upper rim of the jar. The jar sits on a glass-topped table with a metal frame featuring curved, scroll-like designs. The background is a plain off-white wall with a visible electrical outlet near the baseboard. The lighting is soft and diffused, casting subtle shadows.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction specifies several transformations:  
- "Transform the makeup brushes into a collection of sculpted crystal wands, with each wand topped by a unique gemstone." → This means the **form and material** of the brushes are to be changed; their **function as makeup tools** is replaced by **fantasy objects (wands)**. However, the **number**, **arrangement**, and **vertical orientation** may be preserved.  
- "Replace the jar with a transparent crystal vase adorned with etched floral patterns." → The container’s **material and surface design** change, but it remains a **transparent vessel** holding the wands.  
- "The lace band becomes a carved crystal ribbon" → The **decorative band** changes form but retains its **position** and **purpose** (aesthetic embellishment).  
- "Place the arrangement on a mirrored surface to enhance the elegance and detail." → The **surface beneath** changes from glass/metal to **mirror**, altering reflection and depth perception.  

Thus, **allowed changes** include:
- Makeup brushes → crystal wands with gemstones
- Glass jar → crystal vase with etched patterns
- Lace band → carved crystal ribbon
- Table surface → mirrored surface

**Allowed Changes List:**
- Form and material of the brushes (from bristle/handle to crystal/gemstone)
- Container type and texture (glass jar → crystal vase with etched floral patterns)
- Decorative band material and style (lace → carved crystal ribbon)
- Surface beneath the container (glass/metal table → mirrored surface)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
We now identify what **must remain unchanged** based on exclusion and logical necessity:

1. **Core recognition elements**:  
   - The **original subject** is a **set of makeup brushes**, but they are being transformed. However, the **quantity and spatial arrangement** (i.e., how many brushes/wands there are, and their vertical positioning) must likely be preserved for visual continuity. While their **form** changes, the **number and grouping** serve as identity anchors.
   - The **pearl beads inside the jar** are not mentioned in the instructions. Since they are **not explicitly replaced**, and serve as a **visual filler and structural support**, they should be retained **in function** even if their appearance changes slightly (e.g., translucent crystals instead of pearls). But since no replacement is specified, we assume **the presence of filler beads** must be preserved.

2. **Functional/logical association elements**:  
   - The **container holds the wands/brushes upright** — this functional relationship must remain. Even if the container changes, it must still **support the vertical alignment** of the wands.
   - The **positioning of the object on a flat surface** is implied in both original and edited versions. Though the surface changes, the **placement** (centered, upright, stable) should remain consistent.

3. **Non-modified element deduction**:  
   - The **color palette** of the original (white pearls, black handles, blue-and-white lace) is not directly preserved in the edit, but **no instruction mandates color retention**, so it can change.
   - The **background wall** and **electrical outlet** are not referenced in the edit, so they could be removed or altered. However, since the instruction focuses only on the **arrangement**, these environmental details are **not required to be preserved**.
   - The **glass table structure** is changed to mirror, so that is allowed to change.

But note: **The original image contains specific textures and materials** that define its aesthetic:
- The **texture of the lace band** (delicate mesh, floral pattern) is described as “blue and white” — though it's being replaced by a carved crystal ribbon, the **presence of an ornamental band** at the top must remain.
- The **pearls** are not just fillers—they are **uniform, spherical, glossy, and white**, creating a distinct visual layer. Their **presence and function** (to stabilize the brushes) must be preserved, even if material changes.

Thus, **elements that must remain unchanged** are those **not mentioned for transformation** and are **essential to the original composition’s logic**:

**Preservation Targets List:**
- The **presence of multiple upright objects** (originally brushes, now wands) grouped together in a vertical cluster.
- The **presence of a filler material** (pearls) within the container, below the objects.
- The **position of the decorative band** around the upper rim of the container.
- The **overall upright, clustered arrangement** of the objects.
- The **container’s transparency** (since both original jar and new crystal vase are transparent).
- The **functional containment** — the container must hold the objects vertically.

Note: Although the **material** of the brush handles and bristles changes, the **number and relative size variation** of the brushes (some large, some small) should be preserved to maintain visual balance.

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The number and vertical clustering of the brushes is a core compositional feature. In the original image, there are approximately eight brushes of varying sizes arranged closely together. Even after transformation into crystal wands, preserving the same number and clustered vertical layout ensures continuity in visual structure. Losing this would fundamentally alter the scene’s composition and make it unrecognizable as a derived version of the original. Hence, this is a high-weight element.
    Question: Are there exactly eight upright objects arranged in a tight vertical cluster within the container?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The presence of a filler material beneath the brushes is essential to the original setup. The white pearls provide volume and stability. The instruction does not specify replacing the filler, so it must be retained in function. Even if the material changes (e.g., to clear crystals), the **presence of a bed of small spherical objects** below the wands must remain. This is critical for maintaining the visual logic of the arrangement.
    Question: Is there a bed of small, uniformly shaped spherical objects filling the lower portion of the container?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The decorative band around the upper rim of the container is a distinctive visual element. It serves as an aesthetic border. The instruction specifies replacing it with a carved crystal ribbon, but the **position and function** (a decorative ring around the top edge) must remain. Therefore, the **presence of a decorative band at the top rim** must be preserved, even if its material changes.
    Question: Is there a decorative band located precisely at the upper rim of the container?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The container itself is transparent in both original and edited versions. The instruction replaces the glass jar with a crystal vase, but transparency is a shared attribute. Preserving transparency ensures visual continuity and allows the viewer to see the filler material and internal structure. Changing it to opaque would break the core visual logic of the original.
    Question: Is the container transparent, allowing full visibility of the contents inside?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The overall vertical arrangement of the objects is crucial. They are all standing upright, with tips pointing upward. This orientation supports the idea of a tool set or display. The instruction does not suggest horizontal placement or random scattering, so the **upright posture** of each object must be maintained. This is a key functional and visual trait.
    Question: Are all the objects positioned vertically, with their tips pointing upward?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The original image includes a variety of brush sizes — from large powder brushes to smaller detail brushes. This variation in size creates visual interest. Even when transformed into crystal wands, preserving the **size variation among the objects** maintains the original compositional diversity. This detail contributes to the realism and aesthetic balance.
    Question: Are there at least three distinct sizes of objects visible in the cluster (large, medium, small)?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}

{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The container is placed on a flat surface, which is essential for stability. While the surface changes from glass/metal to mirror, the **flatness and horizontal orientation** of the supporting surface must remain. This ensures the arrangement remains grounded and visually coherent. This is a minor but necessary functional detail.
    Question: Is the container resting on a flat, horizontal surface?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
