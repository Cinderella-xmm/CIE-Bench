      "thinking_process": "The half-timbered framework with dark wooden beams forming geometric patterns against light plaster is the defining architectural feature of Alsatian buildings. This pattern is essential for identifying the region and style; altering its structure would make the buildings unrecognizable as half-timbered. Therefore, the presence and configuration of these beams must be preserved regardless of texture enhancement or color change.",
      "question": "Are the dark wooden beams forming geometric patterns on the facades of the buildings clearly visible and structurally accurate?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The steeply pitched gabled roofs with dormer windows are characteristic of traditional Alsatian architecture. These roof forms define the skyline and distinguish the buildings from other styles. Their silhouette must be preserved to maintain the identity of the scene, even if materials or colors are modified.",
      "question": "Do the buildings feature steeply pitched gabled roofs with dormer windows positioned at regular intervals?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The pedestrian bridge across the canal serves as a key functional and compositional element, connecting the two sides and providing depth. Its position and basic structure are critical to the spatial logic of the scene. Even if scaled down in a diorama, its presence and alignment must remain consistent.",
      "question": "Is there a pedestrian bridge spanning the canal in the mid-ground, connecting the two sides of the street?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The reflective surface of the water is a central aesthetic feature, mirroring the buildings and sky. Although the water may be replaced with resin, its reflective quality must be preserved to maintain visual coherence and realism. Loss of reflection would break the illusion of a calm canal environment.",
      "question": "Does the canal surface reflect the surrounding buildings and sky with clear, mirror-like fidelity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The flower boxes on the balcony of the right-hand building are distinctive decorative elements that add charm and regional character. They are visually identifiable and contribute to the authenticity of the scene. Their presence and placement must be retained even if stylized in a diorama.",
      "question": "Are there flower boxes containing green plants visible along the balcony of the large building on the right side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The stone foundations and metal railings along the canal edge provide structural grounding and historical authenticity. These elements anchor the buildings to the ground and define the walkway boundary. Their form must be preserved to maintain the scene’s realism and spatial integrity.",
      "question": "Are stone bases and metal railings present along the canal edges beneath the buildings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The window arrangements—particularly the vertical alignment and rectangular shape—are consistent across buildings and contribute to the architectural rhythm. Altering their positions or numbers would disrupt the visual harmony and misrepresent the original design.",
      "question": "Are the windows arranged in vertical and horizontal lines on the facades, matching the timber frame divisions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
