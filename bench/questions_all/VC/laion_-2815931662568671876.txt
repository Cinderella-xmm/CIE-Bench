**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a still-life food arrangement featuring baked tortilla chips and guacamole. A light blue ceramic bowl filled with triangular, golden-brown baked tortilla chips sits on a white square plate. One chip is placed separately in the foreground, leaning against a mound of green, textured guacamole. The guacamole has a chunky consistency with visible avocado flesh and slight variations in shade from pale yellow to dark green. The background includes a green textured placemat and a dark wooden surface at the top edge. The lighting is bright and even, highlighting textures and colors. At the bottom, a semi-transparent green banner contains bold text: “BAKED TORTILLA CHIPS” in hand-drawn style font, followed by “Feel Great in 8” in smaller print.

Thinking process:  
The editing instructions explicitly transform the largest tortilla chip and the guacamole mound into anthropomorphic characters. This implies that their **form** (shape, posture) will be altered to include facial features, limbs, or accessories. However, the instruction specifies **retaining textures and colors**, meaning the visual qualities such as the rough surface of the chip and the mottled green texture of the guacamole must remain intact. The scene is being reimagined as a whimsical cooking comic set in a rustic kitchen with a festive table, so the original setting (white plate, green placemat, blue bowl) is **not required to be preserved**—it can be replaced. The dialogue bubbles and pastel palette are new elements introduced by the edit and are not part of the original. The only elements explicitly instructed to retain are:
- Textures of the chip and guacamole
- Colors of the chip and guacamole

Therefore, changes allowed include:
- Shape and positioning of the chip and guacamole (they become characters)
- Background environment (replaced with kitchen scene)
- Addition of facial features, limbs, accessories (monocle, cup, banners)
- Use of dialogue bubbles and cartoon-style rendering
- Color palette shift to pastel tones

Allowed Changes List:
- Shape and form of the largest tortilla chip (to become an anthropomorphic character)
- Shape and form of the guacamole mound (to become an anthropomorphic character)
- Background setting (original plate, bowl, placemat, wooden surface can be replaced)
- Positioning of the chip and guacamole (moved to new narrative roles)
- Addition of cartoon features (eyes, mouth, limbs, monocle, cup, banners)
- Use of dialogue bubbles
- Color scheme (shift to light pastel palette)
- Lighting and atmosphere (changed for comic effect)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements:  
The **texture** and **color** of the tortilla chip and guacamole are explicitly stated to be retained. These are essential for maintaining the identity of the food items within the whimsical transformation. Even if they are anthropomorphized, the material appearance must remain recognizable. For example, the chip must still look like a baked corn tortilla chip—not a generic cartoon shape—but with added character traits. Similarly, the guacamole must retain its green, chunky, avocado-based texture.

Functional/logical association elements:  
There are no functional relationships between objects (e.g., no mechanical parts or tools), but the **logical connection** between the chip and guacamole as a dip-and-chip pairing must be preserved in narrative context. The instruction says the guacamole invites other dip characters, implying it remains a central dip item. Thus, while the scene changes, the role of guacamole as a dip should be maintained through visual cues (e.g., it's still green, chunky, and positioned near the chip).

Non-modified element deduction:  
After excluding all allowed changes (shape, position, background, etc.), the remaining unmentioned elements are:
- The **textural details** of the chip: coarse, slightly cracked surface with salt crystals
- The **textural details** of the guacamole: lumpy, uneven, with flecks of avocado pulp and darker green streaks
- The **coloration**: golden brown of the chip (with natural variation), green-yellow gradient of the guacamole
- The **material appearance** of both items (must not appear synthetic or stylized beyond recognition)

These must be preserved because they define what the items *are*—a baked tortilla chip and real guacamole—despite the cartoonification.

Preservation Targets List:
- Texture of the largest tortilla chip (coarse, slightly cracked, with salt specks)
- Color of the largest tortilla chip (golden brown with natural variation)
- Texture of the guacamole mound (chunky, uneven, with visible avocado chunks)
- Color of the guacamole (green-yellow gradient, natural avocado tone)
- Material authenticity of both food items (must not appear plastic or overly stylized)

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The texture of the tortilla chip is a core identifying feature—it distinguishes it from fried or raw chips. The rough, slightly cracked surface with visible salt granules is unique to baked tortilla chips and must be preserved even when anthropomorphized to maintain authenticity. Losing this would make the character unrecognizable as a real chip.
    Question: Is the coarse, slightly cracked texture of the largest tortilla chip retained, including visible salt crystals?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The color of the chip is essential for identity—baked tortilla chips have a distinct golden-brown hue with subtle variation. If changed to a uniform or unnatural color, it would no longer resemble a real baked chip, undermining the realism required even in a whimsical context.
    Question: Is the golden-brown color of the largest tortilla chip preserved, with natural tonal variation?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The guacamole’s chunky texture is a key identifier—smooth or pureed guacamole would not match the original. The presence of visible avocado chunks and uneven surface confirms it is freshly made and authentic. This texture must remain even if animated.
    Question: Is the chunky, uneven texture of the guacamole mound preserved, showing visible avocado pieces?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The green-yellow gradient of the guacamole reflects its natural composition. A solid green or artificial-looking color would break the connection to real food. Retaining this gradient ensures the dip remains visually plausible.
    Question: Is the green-yellow gradient of the guacamole preserved, showing natural avocado color variation?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The material authenticity of the food items—meaning they do not appear cartoonishly smooth, shiny, or synthetic—is crucial. Even in a comic, the base materials must feel real. If the chip looks like paper or the guacamole like clay, the original substance is lost.
    Question: Are the chip and guacamole rendered with realistic material properties, avoiding glossy or plastic-like finishes?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
