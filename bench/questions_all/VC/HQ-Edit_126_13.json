      "thinking_process": "The matte gray vase holding cherry blossom branches is an iconic cultural symbol in this context.

This is a core visual and symbolic element, thus weight 3.",

      "thinking_process": "The diagonal placement of the chopsticks adds compositional balance and suggests human presence.
