Description of reference image: The subject is a pug dog sitting upright on a round, plush orange cushion with fringed edges. The pug has a fawn-colored coat with a black muzzle, dark eyes, and floppy black ears. Its facial features include prominent wrinkles across the forehead, a short snout, and a slightly upturned mouth that gives it a smiling expression. The fur texture is soft and realistic, with visible gradients and fine details in the lighting. The background consists of vintage floral wallpaper featuring large red and pink roses with green leaves on a beige base, creating a warm, classic atmosphere. The lighting is soft and directional, highlighting the pug’s face and casting gentle shadows. The cushion is positioned centrally in the frame, with the pug centered atop it, facing forward.

Thinking process:  
First, analyze the editing instructions word by word:  
- "Transform the pug into a plush, elaborately carved wood sculpture" → This indicates the **subject's material and form** are to be changed from living animal to wooden sculpture.  
- "Replace the lifelike fur with smooth, polished wood grains" → Fur texture is replaced; thus, **fur** is not to be retained.  
- "Using walnut tones to maintain the original color pattern" → Color palette (fawn and black) should be preserved **in tone**, but now as **wood grain coloring**, so **color distribution** (e.g., fawn body, black muzzle) must remain recognizable even if medium changes.  
- "Etch delicate lines to mimic facial wrinkles and detail features" → Facial structure and expressions (wrinkles, eyes, nose shape) must be **retained in form**, though rendered differently.  
- "Set the wooden pug on a simple black base" → The **cushion is to be replaced** with a black base, so the **original cushion and its fringes** are not to be kept.  
- "Contrasting its rich textures and showcasing its craftsmanship" → Focus shifts to **craftsmanship**, implying artistic rendering, but no mention of preserving scene or background.  

Thus, allowed changes include:  
- Subject’s material (from fur to wood)  
- Texture (from fur to wood grain)  
- Base (from cushion to black base)  
- Background (implied change due to focus shift)  
- Cushion and fringe (explicitly replaced)  

However, the instruction specifies **maintaining the original color pattern**, which means **the spatial distribution of colors** (fawn body, black face, ears, etc.) must remain consistent. Also, **facial structure and key anatomical features** must be preserved in form (even if etched).  

Allowed Changes List:  
- Fur texture  
- Material of subject (living dog → wooden sculpture)  
- Cushion and fringes  
- Background (floral wallpaper)  
- Lighting style (may be adjusted for wood texture)  
- Overall surface finish (soft fur → polished wood)  

Step 2 – Determine the elements that should remain unchanged  

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements:  
The pug is identifiable by its **distinctive facial structure**: flat face, prominent wrinkles, short snout, large dark eyes, black muzzle, and floppy ears. These are essential for recognizing the breed. Even as a sculpture, these **anatomical features must be preserved** in shape and placement. The **color pattern** (fawn vs. black areas) must remain consistent, especially since the instruction says “maintain the original color pattern.” This implies the **distribution of fawn and black regions** (e.g., black around the muzzle, ears, and eye area) must be preserved, even if rendered in walnut wood tones.  

Functional/logical association elements:  
There are no functional actions (e.g., holding an object), so no functional logic to preserve. However, the **posture** — sitting upright, front-facing, with paws forward — is critical for identity. Changing this would alter the subject’s pose and make it unrecognizable. The **relative positioning of limbs and head** must remain consistent.  

Non-modified element deduction:  
After excluding allowed changes (texture, material, base, background), the following must remain:  
- **Facial features** (wrinkles, eyes, nose, mouth)  
- **Color zones** (black muzzle, ears, and eye patches; fawn body)  
- **Head shape and ear position**  
- **Body posture** (sitting, front-facing)  
- **Proportions** of the face and body (e.g., wide head, compact body)  

These are derived from visual coherence: changing any of these would result in a non-pug or misrepresentative sculpture.  

Preservation Targets List:  
- Facial wrinkles across the forehead  
- Black muzzle and surrounding facial markings  
- Large dark eyes with visible pupils  
- Floppy black ears positioned on top of the head  
- Upright sitting posture with front paws forward  
- Fawn-colored body with black facial mask  
- Proportional head-to-body ratio typical of a pug

    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The facial wrinkles across the forehead are a core identification feature of the pug breed. They are unique to the species and distinguish it from other dogs. Even when transformed into a wooden sculpture, the presence and arrangement of these wrinkles must be preserved to maintain breed recognition. Their absence would render the sculpture unidentifiable as a pug. Thus, this is a key identity element.
    Question: Are the characteristic forehead wrinkles of the pug present and accurately represented in the sculpture?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The black muzzle and facial markings are essential to the pug’s appearance and are part of the original color pattern explicitly stated to be maintained. These markings define the contrast between the fawn body and dark face, a key visual identifier. If lost or altered in placement, the sculpture would no longer resemble the original pug.
    Question: Is the black muzzle and surrounding facial marking (including under the eyes and around the nose) preserved in the same location and shape as in the original?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The large dark eyes with visible pupils are central to the pug’s expressive face and contribute significantly to its identity. Even in a sculpted form, the eyes must retain their size, position, and depth to preserve the likeness. Their absence or distortion would compromise recognition.
    Question: Are the large, round, dark eyes with clearly defined pupils preserved in the same position and shape as in the original?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The floppy black ears are a distinctive trait of the pug, contributing to its overall silhouette and breed-specific look. Their position on top of the head and drooping shape are necessary for accurate representation. Changing their form or removing them would alter the subject’s identity.
    Question: Are the floppy black ears positioned symmetrically on top of the head and shaped as in the original?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The upright sitting posture with front paws forward is a defining pose in the original image. It contributes to the subject’s presence and balance. Altering this posture would change the composition and make the sculpture appear different from the source, affecting consistency.
    Question: Is the pug depicted in an upright sitting position with both front paws placed forward, matching the original stance?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The fawn-colored body with a distinct contrast to the black facial mask is part of the original color pattern that must be preserved. Even though the material changes to wood, the spatial distribution of fawn and black areas must remain identical to maintain visual fidelity.
    Question: Is the fawn-colored body area preserved in the same region as the original, contrasting with the black facial mask?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The proportional relationship between the head and body is a key aspect of the pug’s physical identity. A disproportionately large or small head would misrepresent the breed. Since the sculpture must resemble the original, this proportion must be retained.
    Question: Is the head-to-body proportion consistent with the original pug, maintaining a broad head relative to the compact body?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
