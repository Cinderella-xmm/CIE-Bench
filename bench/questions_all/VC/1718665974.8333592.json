      "thinking_process": "The blue eyes are a core identification feature of the character, distinguishing her from others and contributing to her iconic appearance. In the original image, they are clearly visible and prominent. Changing their color or removing them would fundamentally alter her identity. Since the instruction does not specify changing eye color, this element must be preserved.",
      "question": "Are the subject's eyes blue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The dark, wavy hair with two feather-like adornments on either side is a distinctive hairstyle that contributes to the character’s unique look. This specific configuration is not mentioned as changeable in the instruction, and altering it would affect recognition. The feathers are positioned symmetrically near the temples, forming part of the character’s signature appearance.",
      "question": "Does the subject have dark wavy hair with two feather-like adornments on each side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The glowing golden orb at the chest is a central visual and symbolic element. It is located directly over the sternum and emits radiant light, connected by golden tendrils. Although the instruction allows adding a clock face inside it, the orb’s presence, position, and luminosity are essential to maintain continuity. Removing or relocating it would destroy the character’s defining magical attribute.",
      "question": "Is there a glowing golden orb centered on the chest, emitting light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The subject is facing forward with a direct gaze toward the viewer, and her posture is upright and symmetrical. This orientation is fundamental to the composition and character portrayal. While clothing and wings may change, the frontal pose ensures consistency in presentation. The instruction does not suggest a change in angle or posture, so it must be retained.",
      "question": "Is the subject facing directly forward with a neutral expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The wings are positioned symmetrically behind the shoulders, extending outward. Though their form will be transformed into clockwork, their placement is critical for maintaining spatial balance and continuity. The original wings are translucent and veined, but their location defines the character’s silhouette. Even in a mechanical version, their position must match the original to preserve compositional logic.",
      "question": "Are the wings positioned symmetrically behind the shoulders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
