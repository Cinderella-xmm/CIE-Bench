**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a young Black man standing upright in a golden savanna landscape during what appears to be sunrise or sunset. He has short, tightly coiled black hair with subtle reddish highlights, likely due to the warm lighting. His facial features are symmetrical, with a strong jawline, full lips, and dark eyes looking directly at the viewer. He wears a vibrant, patterned Dashiki shirt featuring bold geometric designs in blue, yellow, red, green, and orange, with intricate embroidery along the V-neckline and sleeve edges. The shirt has a central vertical panel with diamond-shaped motifs and horizontal bands of color near the hem. The sleeves are short and wide, ending in multicolored striped cuffs. The bottom of the shirt has tassels hanging from the edge. He stands with his hands clasped gently in front of him, palms together, at waist level.  

The background consists of tall, dry golden grass swaying slightly, suggesting a breeze. In the distance, several acacia trees with flat, umbrella-shaped canopies are scattered across the horizon under a soft peach-and-gold sky. A small figure can be seen far off in the left mid-ground, possibly walking through the field. The lighting is warm and directional, casting soft shadows and highlighting the textures of the clothing and grass.

**Thinking process:**  
First, analyze the editing instructions word by word:

- *"Transform the image into a majestic ancient African mural"* → This indicates a **complete stylistic transformation**, including artistic rendering (e.g., fresco-like texture, stylized lines), but does **not specify changing the subject’s identity or core form**.
- *"Emphasizing the man's attire as a regal Dashiki with gold embellishments"* → The **Dashiki remains**, but **new elements (gold embellishments)** are added; thus, the **base design of the Dashiki must be preserved**, though details like color intensity and metallic accents may change.
- *"Depict him as a cultural guardian, with beads and symbols at his shoulders"* → New symbolic additions (beads, shoulder symbols) are introduced; these are **not present in the original**, so they are allowed changes.
- *"Set against a vast savanna with stylized Acacia trees"* → The **savanna setting is retained**, but **trees are now stylized** — meaning their **form can be altered**, but their **presence and general silhouette must remain**.
- *"Enhance the background with a pattern of vivid wild grasses"* → Grass patterns can be **stylized or exaggerated**, but the **presence of tall grass** must be preserved.
- *"Highlighting an old-world mystical atmosphere with earthy hues"* → Atmosphere and color palette can shift toward **earthy tones and mysticism**, but this affects **lighting and mood**, not necessarily structure.

Thus, the **subject’s identity, posture, and core clothing form** are implied to be **retained**, while **style, texture, color depth, and symbolic additions** are permitted to change.

---

**Allowed Changes List:**
- Artistic style (transformed into mural-like texture)
- Addition of gold embellishments on the Dashiki
- Addition of beads and symbolic motifs at the shoulders
- Stylization of Acacia trees (shape, proportion, detail)
- Enhancement of grass patterns (texture, repetition, vibrancy)
- Color tone shifts toward earthy and mystical hues
- Lighting and atmospheric effects (e.g., glow, haze, contrast)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
We now determine what **must not change**, based on the above analysis:

- **Core recognition elements**:  
  - The **subject’s face and identity** must remain recognizable — especially features like **facial structure, skin tone, eye shape, nose, and hair texture**. These define the individual and are essential for identity retention.
  - The **Dashiki shirt’s base pattern** — specifically its **V-neck design, central diamond motif, color blocks, and tassel details** — must be preserved, even if enhanced with gold. The **overall layout and symmetry** of the garment are key to identifying it as a Dashiki.
  - The **posture** — hands clasped in front, upright stance — is part of the subject’s presentation and should remain consistent unless explicitly altered. Since no instruction changes posture, it must be retained.

- **Functional/logical association elements**:  
  - The **spatial relationship between the man and the environment** — he stands **within the savanna**, surrounded by grass and trees — must be maintained. If the scene were replaced entirely (e.g., indoor setting), that would violate the logical context implied by the instruction ("set against a vast savanna").
  - The **relative scale and positioning** — the man is central, with trees in the background and grass in the foreground — must remain intact for spatial coherence.

- **Non-modified element deduction**:  
  After excluding allowed changes (e.g., stylization, new symbols), the following **original visual details must remain**:
  - The **exact shape and placement of the tassels** at the bottom of the Dashiki.
  - The **color scheme of the Dashiki** — particularly the dominant **blue base with yellow, red, and green stripes** — unless overridden by "gold embellishments" (which only adds, not replaces).
  - The **hair texture and volume** — curly, short, natural afro-style — must remain identifiable.
  - The **eyes’ position and gaze direction** — forward-facing, direct — must not change.
  - The **grass height and density** in the foreground — tall and dense enough to partially obscure legs — must remain, even if stylized.

Even if the style becomes mural-like, **these core visual anchors** must survive to maintain consistency with the original.

---

**Preservation Targets List:**
- The subject’s facial features: skin tone, eye shape, nose structure, lip shape, and hair texture
- The Dashiki’s central V-neck pattern with diamond motifs
- The presence and placement of tassels at the bottom hem of the shirt
- The hands clasped in front of the body at waist level
- The upright posture and frontal orientation
- The presence of tall golden grass in the foreground
- The distant acacia trees with flat-topped canopies
- The overall composition: subject centered, grass in front, trees in back

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The subject’s facial structure, particularly the shape of the nose, lips, and eyes, is a core identification feature. Any significant alteration would make the individual unrecognizable. The instruction does not allow changing the person’s identity, only enhancing or stylizing. Therefore, preserving the original facial features is critical for maintaining identity, making this a 3-point question.
    Question: Does the edited image retain the original subject’s facial features, including the shape of the nose, lips, eyes, and skin tone?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The Dashiki’s V-neck with diamond-shaped motifs is a distinctive design element that defines the garment’s identity. Even with added gold embellishments, the underlying pattern must remain visible. Losing this would transform the garment into something unrecognizable as a Dashiki, which contradicts the instruction to emphasize it as a regal version. Thus, this is a core structural feature worth 3 points.
    Question: Is the central V-neck pattern with diamond motifs clearly visible on the Dashiki in the edited image?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The tassels at the bottom of the Dashiki are a unique decorative feature specific to this garment style. Their presence confirms authenticity and continuity with the original. Although the style may be stylized, removing or altering them would compromise the garment’s identity. This is a key detail, but not as foundational as the face or main pattern, hence 2 points.
    Question: Are the tassels at the bottom hem of the Dashiki still present and positioned at the same location as in the original image?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The hands clasped in front at waist level define the subject’s posture and gesture. Changing this would alter the intended expression of dignity and calmness. Since no instruction specifies changing posture, it must be preserved. This is a functional pose that contributes to the character’s portrayal as a cultural guardian, making it important but not irreplaceable — thus 2 points.
    Question: Are the hands positioned in front of the body, clasped together at waist level, as in the original image?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The tall golden grass in the foreground is a key environmental element that establishes the savanna setting. Its presence is required by the instruction to preserve the scene. Even if stylized, it must remain visually distinct as tall grass. Removing or replacing it would break the scene logic. This is an important background feature, so it earns 2 points.
    Question: Is there tall, golden-colored grass in the foreground surrounding the subject’s lower body?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The acacia trees in the background, with their characteristic flat-topped canopy, are iconic to African savannas. The instruction requires them to be present, albeit stylized. Their silhouette and placement must remain recognizable to maintain the scene’s authenticity. While stylization is allowed, their basic form must be preserved. This is a major scene element, so it is weighted at 2 points.
    Question: Are there acacia trees with flat-topped canopies visible in the background behind the subject?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The subject’s hair texture — short, curly, and voluminous — is a defining physical trait. While lighting or color might shift, the overall shape and structure must remain. Altering it drastically (e.g., straightening or shaving) would change identity. This is a minor but identifiable feature, so it is assigned 1 point.
    Question: Does the subject’s hair retain its short, curly, and voluminous texture as seen in the original image?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}
{
    Q8: 
    Thinking process: The central positioning of the subject within the frame is crucial for compositional balance and focus. The instruction implies he remains the focal point, so shifting him off-center or changing perspective would disrupt the intended emphasis. This is a minor compositional detail but affects visual coherence, hence 1 point.
    Question: Is the subject centrally positioned in the frame, facing forward?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
