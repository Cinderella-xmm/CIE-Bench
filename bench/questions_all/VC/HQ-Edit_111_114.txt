Description of reference image: The subject is an elderly man with a white beard and mustache, wearing a wide-brimmed straw hat, a light-colored short-sleeved shirt, and light beige trousers. He is seated on a bright red vintage scooter (resembling a Vespa), positioned centrally in a narrow cobblestone street flanked by warm-toned terracotta buildings with green shutters and arched doorways. The man is smiling gently, looking slightly to his left, with one hand on the handlebar and the other resting on the scooter’s body. The scooter features a chrome front grille, round headlight, side-mounted luggage rack, and a black leather seat. In the background, several figures are engaged in daily activities: a woman stands near a doorway, another sits on a bench beside a bicycle, and a man rides a bicycle further down the alley. Potted plants and climbing vines decorate the building façades. The lighting is soft and golden, suggesting late afternoon sunlight. The overall composition conveys a serene, Mediterranean village atmosphere.

Thinking process:  
First, analyze the editing instructions word by word:  
- "Create a vintage postcard series featuring the man on a scooter" → implies the core subject (man on scooter) must remain recognizable, though stylized.  
- "Cartoonize his form with exaggerated scooter details" → allows transformation of proportions, facial features, and mechanical elements into cartoonish exaggeration.  
- "Render with sepia tones and faded edges" → changes color palette and edge clarity; thus, original colors (e.g., red scooter) may be altered, but shapes and forms must still align with original.  
- "Add ornate frames in art-nouveau style, a blank writing space beneath, and print on textured parchment" → introduces new graphical layers not present originally, but these are additions, not replacements of existing content.  
- "Arrange postcards in twine-bound sets as travel memorabilia" → this is a packaging instruction for final presentation, not affecting visual content of the image itself.  

Therefore, **allowed changes** include:  
- Style transformation (cartoonization) of the man and scooter  
- Color shift to sepia tones  
- Edge fading effects  
- Addition of frames, text areas, parchment texture, and binding — all external enhancements  

However, **the original scene and subject identity must remain identifiable**, even if stylized. The core elements — such as the man’s posture, the scooter’s iconic shape, the architectural setting — must retain enough fidelity to be recognized.

Allowed Changes List:  
(Specific element 1 that allows for changes): The man’s facial features (e.g., eyes, nose, mouth) can be exaggerated or simplified due to cartoonization.  
(Specific element 2 that allows for changes): The scooter’s proportions (e.g., oversized wheels, elongated body) can be exaggerated.  
(Specific element 3 that allows for changes): The color scheme (e.g., red scooter) can be desaturated to sepia tones.  
(Specific element 4 that allows for changes): Background figures and their actions can be simplified or omitted.  
(Specific element 5 that allows for changes): Edges of the image can be faded or blurred.  
(Specific element 6 that allows for changes): Ornamental frames, text area, parchment texture, and twine binding can be added externally.  

Step 2 – Determine the elements that should remain unchanged

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements:  
- The **red scooter** is a key object with distinctive design features (round headlight, front grille, side luggage rack, rounded fenders) characteristic of classic Italian scooters like the Vespa. These shapes are iconic and essential to identify the vehicle type. Even if cartoonized, its silhouette and component layout must remain consistent.  
- The **man’s posture**: sitting upright on the scooter with hands on the handlebars, one leg forward, is central to the narrative. Changing this would alter the action and context.  
- The **straw hat** and **white beard** are defining traits of the man’s identity. While cartoonization may simplify them, they must still be present and recognizable.  
- The **cobblestone street** and **arched doorways with green shutters** establish the Mediterranean village setting. Though background elements may be simplified, their presence and general architecture must be preserved to maintain scene authenticity.  

Functional/logical association elements:  
- The **man riding the scooter** creates a logical action sequence. If the scooter is removed or repositioned incorrectly (e.g., floating), the scene loses coherence. Thus, the spatial relationship between rider and vehicle must be retained.  
- The **scooter's components** (wheels, seat, handlebars) must remain functionally plausible — even if exaggerated, they must suggest mobility and control.  

Non-modified element deduction:  
After excluding allowed changes (color, style, simplification), remaining elements such as:  
- The **shape of the scooter’s front grille and headlight**  
- The **position of the man relative to the scooter**  
- The **presence of the cobblestone pavement**  
- The **overall layout of the alleyway**  
must be preserved because they are not mentioned as changeable and are necessary for visual continuity and identity.

Preservation Targets List:  
(The man’s straw hat must be present and clearly visible)  
(The man’s white beard must be present and distinguishable)  
(The scooter must have a front round headlight)  
(The scooter must have a chrome front grille)  
(The scooter must have a side luggage rack)  
(The scooter must have two wheels with visible tires and spokes)  
(The man must be seated on the scooter with both legs over it)  
(The background must include at least one arched doorway with green shutters)  
(The ground must be composed of cobblestones arranged in a pattern)  

Q1:  
Thinking process: The straw hat is a core identifier of the man’s appearance and cultural context. Its presence and shape (wide brim, natural color) distinguish him from other characters and contribute to the Mediterranean aesthetic. If missing or replaced, the character becomes unrecognizable. This is a key identity feature, hence weight 3.  
Question: Is the man wearing a wide-brimmed straw hat?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The white beard is a defining facial feature that contributes to the man’s age and personality. It is a primary identifier in the original image. Removing or altering it significantly would change the character’s identity. This is a core recognition element, so weight 3.  
Question: Does the man have a full white beard and mustache?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The front round headlight is a signature feature of the scooter model. Its presence defines the vehicle’s identity and distinguishes it from other types of scooters or motorcycles. Even in cartoon form, this element must be retained to preserve the vehicle’s recognition. This is a core functional/visual element, hence weight 3.  
Question: Does the scooter have a circular headlight at the front?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The chrome front grille is a distinctive structural detail unique to certain vintage scooters. It contributes to the vehicle’s mechanical identity and visual symmetry. Its absence would make the scooter look generic or inaccurate. This is a key accessory feature, so weight 2.  
Question: Is there a chrome grille located below the headlight on the scooter’s front?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The side luggage rack is a functional and stylistic detail that identifies the scooter as a utility vehicle. It adds realism and context to the scene. Even if exaggerated, its presence helps confirm the scooter’s model and purpose. This is an important accessory, so weight 2.  
Question: Does the scooter have a metal luggage rack mounted on the front side?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The two-wheeled structure with visible tires and spokes is fundamental to the scooter’s functionality. Altering wheel count or removing tires would destroy the vehicle’s logic. This is a critical structural element, hence weight 3.  
Question: Does the scooter have two wheels, each with a visible tire and spoke pattern?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The man’s seated position on the scooter, with both legs over it, establishes the action of riding. Changing this (e.g., standing, floating) would break the narrative. This is a core functional pose, so weight 2.  
Question: Is the man seated on the scooter with both legs extended forward over the footrest?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q8:  
Thinking process: The cobblestone pavement is a key environmental feature that defines the setting. Its texture and pattern provide historical and geographical context. Replacing it with smooth stone or asphalt would misrepresent the location. This is an important scene element, so weight 2.  
Question: Is the ground paved with irregularly shaped cobblestones arranged in a herringbone pattern?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q9:  
Thinking process: At least one arched doorway with green shutters is essential to maintaining the Mediterranean architectural style. Their presence anchors the scene in a specific cultural context. Removing all such features would alter the environment beyond recognition. This is a key background element, so weight 2.  
Question: Is there at least one arched doorway with green shutters visible in the background buildings?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2
