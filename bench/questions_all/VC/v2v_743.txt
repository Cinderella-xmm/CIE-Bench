Description of reference image: The subject is a male tennis player positioned on a blue tennis court with white boundary lines. He is wearing a bright yellow shirt, a matching yellow headband, and holding a black tennis racket with an orange accent. His posture suggests readiness, with his gaze directed forward, and his hair is styled in a slightly tousled manner. The background consists solely of the tennis court surface.

### Step 1 - Allowed Changes List:

Thinking process: The instructions specify transforming the tennis player into a 3D chibi-style figurine, changing his proportions and style significantly. The scene is also altered by placing the chibi figure inside a Polaroid photograph held by a human hand, with the figure breaking through the Polaroid frame. Therefore, the original background and the player's realistic proportions and style can be changed.

Allowed Changes List:
Specific element 1 that allows for changes: The tennis player's realistic proportions and style can be changed to a 3D chibi-style.
Specific element 2 that allows for changes: The original tennis court background can be replaced with a Polaroid photograph and a real-world 3D environment.
Specific element 3 that allows for changes: The tennis racket size can be adjusted to fit the chibi figure.

### Step 2 - Preservation Targets List:

Thinking process: Core recognition elements include the tennis player's iconic yellow attire and the tennis racket he holds, as these are essential for recognizing him even in a chibi form. Functional/logical elements include the action of holding the racket, which must be preserved for the figure to appear natural. Remaining elements like the headband and hair style contribute to visual coherence.

Preservation Targets List:
(Element 1 that should be maintained): Yellow attire (shirt and headband)
(Element 2 that should be maintained): Tennis racket (shape and presence)
(Element 3 that should be maintained): Action of holding the racket
(Element 4 that should be maintained): Tousled hair style
(Element 5 that should be maintained): Overall posture suggesting readiness
