      "thinking_process": "The two sausages are key identifiers of the breakfast meal. Their elongated cylindrical shape and parallel placement on the left side of the plate are essential for recognizing the dish. Even when transformed into mosaic tiles, the shape and position must remain to preserve the core identity of the meal. Loss of this form would render the dish unrecognizable.",
      "question": "Are the two elongated sausage-shaped forms positioned on the left side of the plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The fried egg is a defining component of the breakfast plate, particularly due to its circular shape and central orange yolk. The presence of a distinct yolk within a white ring is a core visual feature that identifies it as an egg. Replacing it with mosaic tiles must preserve this circular form and central coloration to maintain recognition.",
      "question": "Is there a circular form with a central orange-yellow disc representing the egg yolk located in the lower right quadrant of the plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The salad is composed of leafy greens and red cherry tomatoes, forming a distinct cluster in the upper right. The presence of both green and red elements is critical for identifying the salad. Even in mosaic form, the cluster must retain this dual-color composition and spatial grouping to be recognizable.",
      "question": "Is there a cluster of green and red elements in the upper right portion of the plate representing the salad?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The gray ceramic plate serves as the foundational container for the meal. Its circular shape and neutral color provide contrast and context. While the instruction allows transformation into a \"plain ceramic backdrop,\" the plate’s shape and function as a circular base must be preserved to maintain the scene’s coherence.",
      "question": "Is the meal arranged on a circular gray plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The relative positions of the sausages, egg, and salad create a balanced composition. The sausages on the left, egg on the lower right, and salad on the upper right form a triangular layout that is visually stable and recognizable. Altering this arrangement would disrupt the intended meal structure.",
      "question": "Are the sausages on the left, the egg in the lower right, and the salad in the upper right of the plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The presence of small red tomato halves within the salad is a detail that distinguishes it from other greens. Even in mosaic form, these red elements must be present and grouped with the greens to represent the salad accurately.",
      "question": "Are there distinct red circular elements interspersed among the green elements in the salad cluster?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The rosemary sprigs are minor garnishes but contribute to the authenticity of the dish. While they may be omitted due to scale in mosaic form, their presence adds detail. If preserved, they should appear as thin green lines near the sausages. Their absence is acceptable, but if included, they must be accurate.",
      "question": "Are there thin green linear elements (rosemary) placed along the sausages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
