If the tree were moved or duplicated, the image’s identity would fundamentally shift. Even under Art Deco transformation, the **presence of one central tree** must be preserved to retain the original intent. This is a key identification feature, making it a 3-point question.",

This unique silhouette distinguishes it from other tree types and is crucial for recognition. Even if stylized into geometric forms, the **tiered arrangement** must remain intact. Losing this would make the tree unrecognizable as the original subject. Thus, it is a core identity feature, warranting 3 points.",

The tree must remain in front of the mountains to preserve depth and perspective. If the mountains were placed in front or the tree relocated, the environmental coherence would collapse. This is a functional/logical element that must be retained, even if the mountains’ shape changes. Hence, it is a 2-point question.",

It reinforces the tree’s physical presence and interaction with the environment. Even in a stylized stained glass version, the shadow must remain to maintain logical consistency. Removing it would break the scene’s coherence. This is an important detail affecting overall realism, so it is assigned 2 points.",

While its color may change, the **presence of a flat, open terrain** beneath the tree must be preserved. Changing it to uneven terrain or removing it would alter the scene’s context.
