Description of reference image: The subject is a teddy bear wearing a white helmet and a blue cape, seated on a silver motorcycle. The teddy bear has a fluffy golden-brown fur texture, black button eyes, and a brown nose. The motorcycle is detailed with chrome parts, a round headlight, and black tires. The background features a scenic view with Sugarloaf Mountain in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, visible under a clear blue sky.

### Step 1 - Allowed Changes List:

Thinking process: The editing instructions specify converting the image into a faceted low-poly 3-D render style. This implies changes to the surface texture, rendering style, and possibly some proportions while retaining the core identity and scene elements.

Allowed Changes List:
Specific element 1 that allows for changes: Surface texture of the teddy bear and motorcycle can be transformed into a faceted low-poly style.
Specific element 2 that allows for changes: Proportions and angles may be slightly adjusted to fit the low-poly style.
Specific element 3 that allows for changes: The background scenery can be simplified or stylized to match the low-poly aesthetic.

### Step 2 - Preservation Targets List:

Thinking process:
Core recognition elements include the teddy bear's distinct features (helmet, cape, fur color, facial features), the motorcycle's iconic shape and components, and the recognizable Sugarloaf Mountain in the background. Functional/logical elements include the teddy bear sitting on the motorcycle and the mountain's position relative to the subject. Remaining elements like the teddy bear's posture and the motorcycle's design details should also be retained for visual coherence.

Preservation Targets List:
(Element 1 that should be maintained): Teddy bear's helmet and blue cape.
(Element 2 that should be maintained): Teddy bear's golden-brown fur color and facial features.
(Element 3 that should be maintained): Motorcycle's overall shape and key components (headlight, wheels, handlebars).
(Element 4 that should be maintained): Position of the teddy bear on the motorcycle.
(Element 5 that should be maintained): Sugarloaf Mountain in the background.
