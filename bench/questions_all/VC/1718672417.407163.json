      "thinking_process": "The shape and position of the ears are critical anatomical features that distinguish a llama from other animals. In this image, the ears are upright, pointed, and located symmetrically on top of the head. They are a core identifier of the species. Even if the subject is transformed into a mythological figure, losing this feature would make it unrecognizable as originating from a llama. Therefore, preserving the ear shape and position is essential for identity retention.",
      "question": "Are the ears upright and positioned symmetrically on top of the head?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The glasses are a defining accessory in the original image, contributing significantly to the character's persona. Their dark brown frames, thick rims, and placement directly over the eyes are distinctive. Removing or relocating them would fundamentally alter the visual identity of the subject. Since no instruction specifies changing their form or position, they must be preserved.",
      "question": "Are the dark-framed glasses positioned directly over the eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The red bandana is a specific accessory placed across the forehead, just above the glasses. It is a unique detail that adds to the character’s stylized appearance. Although the instruction allows for ornamental additions, it does not mention removing or replacing the bandana. Thus, its presence and location must be maintained to ensure continuity.",
      "question": "Is there a red patterned bandana wrapped around the forehead, above the glasses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The white fur texture is a fundamental characteristic of the llama, especially visible on the head and neck. While the instruction allows for overlaying Norse attire, the underlying fur should remain visible or implied to maintain biological plausibility. Losing the white fur would erase the animal’s base identity.",
      "question": "Is the white fur texture visible on the head and upper neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The braids originate from the neck and hang downward, forming a distinct visual structure. They are made from the llama’s own fur and serve as both decoration and identity marker. Although the instruction allows adding metalwork and amulets, the braids’ origin and attachment point must remain unchanged to preserve their connection to the original subject.",
      "question": "Do the braids extend downward from the neck area and appear to be made from the subject’s own fur?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The head is turned slightly to the left, with the gaze directed toward the viewer. This pose is central to the composition and emotional tone of the image. Altering the head angle or gaze direction would disrupt the viewer’s engagement and break continuity with the original.",
      "question": "Is the head turned slightly to the left, with the gaze facing forward toward the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
