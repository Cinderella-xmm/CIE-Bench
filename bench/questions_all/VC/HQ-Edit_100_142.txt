**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a Black man seated in profile, facing right, wearing traditional West African attire. He wears a colorful, intricately patterned dashiki-style garment with bold geometric designs in red, blue, yellow, orange, and black. The fabric features repeating motifs such as sunbursts, stripes, and zigzags. His head is wrapped in a vibrant, multicolored turban made of the same textile, tied tightly with visible folds and layered textures. He has a short beard and mustache, and his facial expression is serene and focused. He is seated on a dark wooden block or stool, positioned slightly off-center to the left, with his legs crossed at the knee. In front of him rests a djembe drum—made of wood with a taut animal-skin head secured by black rope lacing around the rim. His hands are raised mid-motion, poised above the drumhead as if in the act of playing, with fingers spread and palms curved. The background depicts an expansive savanna landscape at dusk: golden-brown grasslands stretch into rolling hills under a soft gradient sky transitioning from pale yellow near the horizon to light beige above. A few acacia trees are scattered across the distance, silhouetted against the warm glow. The lighting is soft and directional, suggesting low-angle sunlight from behind the subject, casting a golden backlight that outlines his silhouette and enhances the texture of his clothing.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction specifies transforming the image into an *Impressionist painting* capturing the rhythm of an African tribal ceremony at dusk. Key transformation directives include:

- **"Transform the image into an Impressionist painting"**: This implies a stylistic shift—brushwork, color blending, texture application—but not structural change to core elements.
- **"Enhance the attire's vibrant colors with exaggerated brushstrokes"**: The colors and patterns of the clothing can be intensified and stylized via brushwork, but the *presence*, *design*, and *identity* of the patterns must remain recognizable.
- **"Blur the background into warm golden hues"**: Background details like trees and terrain can be abstracted or softened, but their *existence* and *placement* (e.g., distant hills, sparse trees) should still reflect the original scene’s spatial logic.
- **"Depict the drum's texture with tactile, layered paint"**: The drum’s form and function must remain intact; its texture may be rendered impressionistically, but its shape, rope lacing, and skin surface must be identifiable.
- **"Include stylized grass and trees as dynamic elements that echo the subject's rhythmic movement"**: Grass and trees may be reinterpreted dynamically, but they must still occupy their original positions and serve as environmental anchors.

Thus, the following elements are **allowed to change**:
- Artistic style (from photorealism to Impressionism)
- Brushstroke application
- Color saturation and blending (especially in clothing and background)
- Texture rendering (especially on drum and clothing)
- Background detail clarity (blurry vs sharp)
- Stylization of vegetation and trees (as long as they retain general form)

**Allowed Changes List:**
- Artistic rendering style (Impressionist brushwork)
- Color intensity and blending (especially in clothing and background)
- Texture treatment (e.g., layered paint on drum)
- Background clarity and abstraction (blurred golden hues)
- Vegetation dynamics (stylized grass and trees echoing rhythm)
- Lighting tone (enhanced warmth of dusk)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
We now identify what **must not change**, based on exclusion from the allowed changes and logical consistency:

**Core recognition elements:**
- The **subject’s identity** as a man playing a djembe drum in traditional attire is central. His **profile pose**, **facial features**, **beard**, and **hand position** define the action and cultural context.
- The **djembe drum** is a key cultural object. Its **cylindrical wooden body**, **tension ropes**, and **drumhead** are essential for identification. Even if painted impressionistically, these forms must remain distinguishable.
- The **dashiki outfit** and **turban** are iconic cultural markers. Their **distinctive patterns** (sunburst motifs, geometric lines, color blocks) are critical for cultural authenticity and visual recognition.
- The **seated posture** on a wooden block and **hand gesture over the drum** are functional and compositional anchors. Changing them would disrupt the narrative of drumming.

**Functional/logical association elements:**
- The **position of the drum relative to the subject** must be preserved: it sits between his legs, held securely, with hands above it—this reflects realistic drumming posture.
- The **spatial relationship between subject and environment** must remain consistent: he is in the foreground, seated, with open savanna behind him. Removing or relocating this setting would break the scene’s logic.
- The **direction of light** (backlighting from behind) contributes to the mood and silhouette. While tone may be altered, the direction and effect should be retained.

**Non-modified element deduction:**
After excluding all permitted changes (style, texture, color intensity), the remaining visual content—such as **the specific pattern layout on the clothing**, **the shape of the turban**, **the drum’s lacing structure**, **the subject’s facial structure**, and **the overall composition**—must be preserved. These are not mentioned for modification and are necessary for coherence.

**Preservation Targets List:**
- The subject’s profile face with beard and mustache
- The presence and position of the djembe drum with visible rope lacing and drumhead
- The distinctive geometric patterns on the dashiki and turban
- The seated posture on a wooden block with hands raised toward the drum
- The background elements: distant hills, scattered acacia trees, golden savanna
- The lighting direction creating a backlight silhouette

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The man's profile face with beard and mustache is a core identity feature. It defines the subject’s human form and cultural representation. If this were altered beyond recognition—e.g., changing facial structure or removing facial hair—the character would no longer be identifiable. This is a key element for identity preservation, hence weight 3.
    Question: Is the subject's face shown in profile with a visible beard and mustache?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The djembe drum is a culturally significant object and central to the scene’s action. Its cylindrical shape, rope lacing, and drumhead are defining physical features. Even in Impressionist style, these must remain visually identifiable. Losing the drum’s structure would destroy the narrative of drumming. Thus, it is a core functional element with weight 3.
    Question: Is the djembe drum present with a visible wooden body, tension ropes, and drumhead?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The dashiki’s unique geometric patterns (sunbursts, stripes, zigzags) are iconic cultural identifiers. These patterns are not just decorative—they signify regional heritage. Altering or removing them would lose cultural specificity. Though colors may be enhanced, the underlying design must remain. This is a key visual identifier, so weight 3.
    Question: Are the distinct geometric patterns (including sunbursts and stripes) visible on the subject’s clothing?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The seated posture on a wooden block with hands raised over the drum is essential for depicting the act of drumming. This positioning establishes the subject’s interaction with the instrument. Changing this would make the action implausible. It is a functional and compositional anchor, thus weight 2.
    Question: Is the subject seated on a block with hands raised above the drum in a drumming pose?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The background includes distant hills and acacia trees in a savanna setting. These elements establish the geographic and cultural context. Although the background may be blurred into golden hues, the presence and placement of hills and trees must remain to preserve the scene’s logic. Their absence would misrepresent the environment. This is an important scene element, so weight 2.
    Question: Are distant hills and scattered acacia trees visible in the background?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The turban’s layered, multicolored fabric with visible folds is a key accessory. It matches the clothing’s pattern and reinforces cultural identity. While texture may be stylized, the turban’s form and color scheme must remain recognizable. It is a secondary but distinctive detail, so weight 1.
    Question: Is the subject wearing a multicolored turban with visible folds and matching patterns?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}
{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The lighting creates a backlight silhouette, enhancing the subject’s outline and adding dramatic depth. This directional light source is crucial for mood and composition. Even if tones are shifted, the backlighting effect must persist. It supports visual coherence and emotional tone, so weight 2.
    Question: Is there a backlight effect creating a golden silhouette around the subject's head and shoulders?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
