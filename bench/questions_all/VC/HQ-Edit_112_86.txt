Description of reference image: The subject is an ornate metallic teapot with a highly reflective silver surface, positioned centrally on a rustic wooden table. The teapot features a rounded body adorned with intricate embossed floral patterns, prominently displaying a large rose at the center surrounded by detailed leaves and smaller blossoms. The lid is domed with a decorative finial on top, and the spout curves gracefully to the left. The handle is dark brown, possibly made of wood or stained material, with carved details and metal fittings connecting it to the body. A thin band of engraved scrollwork encircles the base of the lid and another near the bottom of the teapot. The background is softly blurred in warm earthy tones, emphasizing the teapot as the focal point. The lighting highlights the reflective quality of the metal and casts subtle shadows on the wooden surface below.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions that clearly state what can be changed:  
- "Transform the ornate teapot into a glass sculpture" → indicates the **material** and **form** of the teapot can change from metal to glass.  
- "Use clear glass for the main structure" → allows change in material but specifies transparency.  
- "Incorporating frosted floral patterns that mimic the original engravings" → implies the **design motif** (floral pattern) should be preserved in form but altered in texture (frosted instead of embossed).  
- "Enhance the handle and spout with tinted amber glass for contrast" → allows modification of the **handle and spout materials and colors**, changing from dark wood-like to amber-tinted glass.  
- "Place it on a mirrored surface to emphasize the delicate craftsmanship and transparency" → changes the **surface beneath the teapot**, replacing the wooden table with a mirrored one.  

Thus, the allowed changes include:  
- Material of the teapot body (metal → glass)  
- Texture of the floral design (embossed metal → frosted glass)  
- Color and material of handle and spout (dark wood → amber glass)  
- Surface underneath (wooden table → mirrored surface)  

No mention is made of altering the **shape**, **proportion**, or **overall composition** of the teapot’s silhouette, nor the **floral arrangement** itself—only its medium and texture. Therefore, these aspects are not explicitly permitted to change and must be retained unless logically implied otherwise.

Allowed Changes List:  
- Material of the teapot body (metal → clear glass)  
- Texture of the floral engraving (embossed → frosted)  
- Handle and spout material and color (dark → amber-tinted glass)  
- Base surface (wooden table → mirrored surface)

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements: The identity of the object as a **teapot** depends on its **basic functional form**: a vessel with a spout, handle, and lid. Even if transformed into glass, the **silhouette and structural layout** (spout on left, handle on right, domed lid with finial) must remain intact to preserve recognition. Additionally, the **floral design**, especially the **central rose and surrounding leaf arrangement**, is a defining visual feature that gives the teapot its ornamental identity. Although the texture may change (embossed → frosted), the **pattern layout and composition** must be preserved to maintain continuity.  

Functional/logical association elements: The **spout** must remain oriented toward the left to retain functional logic; reversing it would disrupt usability and visual coherence. Similarly, the **handle** must remain on the right side to allow proper grip and balance. The **lid and finial** must stay atop the dome to fulfill the sealing function. These spatial relationships are critical to the object's identity and use.  

Non-modified element deduction: While the material and texture of the floral design are allowed to change, the **specific placement and shape** of the rose and surrounding foliage are not mentioned as alterable. Since the instruction says “mimic the original engravings,” this implies preservation of **design topology**. Also, although the surface changes, the **positioning of the teapot** (centered, upright) and its **relative proportions** (rounded body, curved spout) are not specified for alteration and thus should be retained.  

Preservation Targets List:  
- The overall silhouette of the teapot (rounded body, curved spout, arched handle)  
- The presence and position of the central rose in the floral design  
- The arrangement of leaves and smaller flowers around the rose  
- The location of the lid and finial on top of the teapot  
- The relative positioning of the spout (left) and handle (right)  
- The shape and orientation of the finial on the lid

    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The central rose is the most prominent and iconic element of the floral design, serving as the focal point of the decoration. Its presence and specific placement at the center of the teapot’s body are essential to the visual identity of the original piece. If removed or relocated, the entire aesthetic balance and recognizability of the design would be compromised. This is a core identifying feature, hence weighted 3 points.
    Question: Is the large central rose still present and located at the center of the teapot's body?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The arrangement of leaves and smaller flowers surrounding the central rose forms a coherent botanical pattern that defines the decorative style. Altering this layout would break the visual harmony and make the design unrecognizable as a derivative of the original. This pattern is not just decorative but structurally significant, making it a key retention target with a weight of 3 points.
    Question: Are the surrounding leaves and smaller flowers arranged symmetrically around the central rose in the same configuration as in the original?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The spout's position on the left side of the teapot is a functional and compositional necessity. Changing its side would disrupt both the usability and visual balance of the object. The curved shape of the spout is also a distinctive feature that contributes to the teapot’s elegance. This spatial and morphological detail is crucial and thus carries a weight of 3 points.
    Question: Is the spout still positioned on the left side of the teapot and shaped with a smooth, curved extension?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The handle’s placement on the right side is essential for ergonomic and visual symmetry. While its material may change, its location and general arch shape must remain to preserve the teapot’s functional logic and balance. This is a critical structural element, so it is assigned 2 points for importance in maintaining logical consistency.
    Question: Is the handle still attached to the right side of the teapot and maintains an arched shape?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The finial on the lid is a distinctive decorative element that crowns the teapot and adds to its ornate character. Its presence and position on top of the lid are part of the object’s signature silhouette. Removing or relocating it would diminish the teapot’s identifiable form. As a key design feature, it is worth 2 points.
    Question: Is the finial still present on top of the lid and retains its decorative knob-like shape?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The lid itself, including its domed shape and the band of engraved scrollwork near the edge, is a core component of the teapot’s structure. While the texture may change, the lid must remain closed and positioned correctly to maintain the object’s integrity. This is a secondary but important element affecting functionality and appearance, thus rated 2 points.
    Question: Is the lid still covering the top of the teapot and retaining its domed shape with the decorative band near the rim?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The overall rounded body shape of the teapot is fundamental to its identity as a traditional teapot. Any drastic change in volume or contour would make it unrecognizable. Although the material changes, the silhouette must remain consistent. This is a foundational structural feature, warranting 2 points.
    Question: Does the teapot retain its rounded, bulbous body shape with a smooth transition between the base and the upper section?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
