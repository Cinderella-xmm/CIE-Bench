      "thinking_process": "The spiky blonde hair is a defining feature of Naruto Uzumaki across all media. Its shape, volume, and golden-yellow color are essential for character recognition. Altering its form or color would make the character unrecognizable. This is a core identity element, hence weight 3.",
      "question": "Is the character's spiky blonde hair present and maintaining its original shape and golden-yellow color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The three black whisker-like marks on each cheek are unique to Naruto and distinguish him from other characters. Their number, position, and shape are fixed in canon. Removing or altering them would compromise character identity. This is a core recognition feature, thus weight 3.",
      "question": "Are there exactly three black whisker marks on each cheek of the character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The Konoha forehead protector with the spiral symbol is a key iconographic element. It identifies Naruto’s village affiliation and is central to his identity. The spiral emblem must be clearly visible and correctly positioned. Loss of this symbol would damage authenticity and recognition. Weight 3.",
      "question": "Is the Konoha forehead protector visible with the spiral symbol clearly engraved on the metal plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The energy blast originates from Naruto’s right hand, which is a functional and logical element of the attack. The hand must remain extended in the same direction and position to maintain causal continuity. Even if anthropomorphized, the source point must stay intact. This is a functional/logical anchor, hence weight 2.",
      "question": "Is the blue energy blast originating from the character’s right hand, which is extended forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The electric blue color of the energy blast is characteristic of Naruto’s chakra-based techniques (e.g., Rasengan). Changing its base color would alter the elemental identity of the attack. While the blast can be anthropomorphized, its primary hue must remain blue. This is a key visual attribute tied to the technique’s identity. Weight 2.",
      "question": "Is the dominant color of the energy blast electric blue, consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The orange eyes with black pupils are a distinctive trait of Naruto in his Sage Mode or Nine-Tails Chakra Mode. They are essential for identifying his current state. Altering eye color would misrepresent his transformation. This is a core identity feature, though less universally known than hair or whiskers, still significant. Weight 2.",
      "question": "Do the character’s eyes appear orange with black pupils?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The orange and black outfit with circular patterns on the collar is a signature part of Naruto’s design. The color combination and pattern are consistent across official depictions. Altering this would make the character visually inconsistent. Though not as critical as face features, it is a key accessory element. Weight 1.",
      "question": "Is the character wearing an orange and black outfit with circular patterns visible on the collar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "thinking_process": "The direction of energy flow — from right hand to left side of the frame — establishes the attack vector. Reversing it would disrupt the narrative logic of the scene. While motion can be exaggerated, the origin-to-target path must remain consistent. This is a spatial-functional element. Weight 1.",
      "question": "Does the energy blast extend from the character’s right hand toward the left side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
