      "thinking_process": "The man's profile face with beard and mustache is a core identity feature. It defines the subject’s human form and cultural representation. If this were altered beyond recognition—e.g., changing facial structure or removing facial hair—the character would no longer be identifiable. This is a key element for identity preservation, hence weight 3.",
      "question": "Is the subject's face shown in profile with a visible beard and mustache?",

      "thinking_process": "The djembe drum is a culturally significant object and central to the scene’s action. Its cylindrical shape, rope lacing, and drumhead are defining physical features. Even in Impressionist style, these must remain visually identifiable. Losing the drum’s structure would destroy the narrative of drumming. Thus, it is a core functional element with weight 3.",
      "question": "Is the djembe drum present with a visible wooden body, tension ropes, and drumhead?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The dashiki’s unique geometric patterns (sunbursts, stripes, zigzags) are iconic cultural identifiers. These patterns are not just decorative—they signify regional heritage. Altering or removing them would lose cultural specificity. Though colors may be enhanced, the underlying design must remain. This is a key visual identifier, so weight 3.",
      "question": "Are the distinct geometric patterns (including sunbursts and stripes) visible on the subject’s clothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The seated posture on a wooden block with hands raised over the drum is essential for depicting the act of drumming. This positioning establishes the subject’s interaction with the instrument. Changing this would make the action implausible. It is a functional and compositional anchor, thus weight 2.",
      "question": "Is the subject seated on a block with hands raised above the drum in a drumming pose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The background includes distant hills and acacia trees in a savanna setting. These elements establish the geographic and cultural context. Although the background may be blurred into golden hues, the presence and placement of hills and trees must remain to preserve the scene’s logic. Their absence would misrepresent the environment. This is an important scene element, so weight 2.",
      "question": "Are distant hills and scattered acacia trees visible in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The turban’s layered, multicolored fabric with visible folds is a key accessory. It matches the clothing’s pattern and reinforces cultural identity. While texture may be stylized, the turban’s form and color scheme must remain recognizable. It is a secondary but distinctive detail, so weight 1.",
      "question": "Is the subject wearing a multicolored turban with visible folds and matching patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The lighting creates a backlight silhouette, enhancing the subject’s outline and adding dramatic depth. This directional light source is crucial for mood and composition. Even if tones are shifted, the backlighting effect must persist. It supports visual coherence and emotional tone, so weight 2.",
      "question": "Is there a backlight effect creating a golden silhouette around the subject's head and shoulders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
