Its defining feature is the **presence of flowing, curved lines composed of multicolored bokeh lights** (red, orange, blue, purple, teal). This is not just a color scheme but a specific spatial and textural pattern. Losing this would violate the instruction and destroy the visual context. It is a core scene element, making it a 3-point question.",

The **beige coat has a visible woolen texture with distinct folds and surface detail**, especially noticeable on the lapels and shoulders. This texture is critical to maintaining the realism and richness of the garment. In a 3D render, this must be represented with similar fidelity. It is a key accessory detail, hence 3 points.",
