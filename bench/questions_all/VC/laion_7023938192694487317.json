      "thinking_process": "The \"CRAFT\" logo is explicitly referenced in the editing instruction as needing emphasis. Its presence and location are critical for brand identity. The logo consists of the word \"CRAFT\" in white sans-serif font with three small dots below it. If this logo is missing or relocated, the figurine would not align with the original branding. Therefore, preserving its presence and position is essential for identity retention. This is a core brand identifier, making it a 3-point question.",

      "thinking_process": "The \"Z healthcare\" logo is a unique composite symbol combining a stylized \"Z\" with American flag-inspired stripes and the word \"healthcare.\" This specific combination is the primary identifying mark of the organization represented. Removing or altering its structure would destroy its recognizability. The instruction emphasizes this logo, meaning it must remain visually intact, even if enhanced. This is a core identity element.",

      "thinking_process": "The text \"healthcare\" beneath the \"Z\" logo is a critical component of the full brand identity. Without it, the logo loses its full meaning and becomes ambiguous. The instruction does not suggest removing it, only enhancing it. Thus, its presence and placement are essential for accurate representation. This is a key detail contributing to the identity of the logo.",

      "thinking_process": "The man's facial features—specifically the glasses, beard, and hairstyle—are not mentioned for alteration. In a figurine transformation, these features are likely to be preserved for personal identification. The glasses are a distinct feature (black frames with tortoiseshell temples), and the beard is prominent and well-defined. Their absence would make the figurine unrecognizable as the original person. This is a core recognition element.",

      "thinking_process": "The beard and mustache are a defining facial characteristic of the individual. Their presence and reddish-brown color help distinguish him from others. Since the transformation is focused on the torso, the head and facial hair are expected to remain unchanged in form. Altering them would compromise identity. This is a core identity feature.",

These positions establish the spatial relationship of the branding elements. Misplacing them would create confusion and break the intended visual layout.
