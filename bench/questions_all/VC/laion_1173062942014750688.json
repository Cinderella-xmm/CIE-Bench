In the instruction, they are explicitly designated as **\"iridescent eyes\"** for the serpent. This makes them a **core functional and visual identifier**—their retention is essential to fulfill the transformation logic. Without them, the serpent would lack the key feature derived from the original beads, breaking the intended visual link. Hence, this is a **3-point weight** question.",

      "thinking_process": "The **red and yellow base colors** dominate the bead patterns and are specified to become the **scales** of the serpent. These colors are not just decorative—they form the **primary palette** of the original object. Their absence would mean the serpent is no longer visually rooted in the source material. Since the instruction uses them directly for the new form, their **presence and dominance** must be preserved. This is a **core identity element**, hence **3 points**.",

These are not random—they are **signature patterns** of the original beads. Their retention ensures the **aesthetic authenticity** of the transformation. While they could theoretically be simplified, the instruction requires integration as **markings**, so their **presence and style** must be maintained. This is a **key visual element**, thus **3 points**.",

Though the instruction allows transformation into a segmented body, the **individual segments** must still reflect the **original bead shape**—especially since the tail is described as having **\"dangling, smaller bead-like tips\"**. This implies that the **basic geometric form** of the beads should be preserved in the creature’s anatomy. Losing this would make the transformation feel disconnected from the source. This is an **important structural detail**, so **2 points**.",

      "thinking_process": "The **matte, hand-painted texture** is evident in the original beads—no glossy finish, slight imperfections in color edges. This texture contributes to the **authentic craft aesthetic**. The instruction does not specify changing it, and retaining it ensures the **visual consistency** between original and transformed. While not as critical as color or pattern, it supports **material authenticity**. Thus, it is a **minor but meaningful detail**, worth **1 point**.",

The instruction does not allow substitution of these colors—instead, it uses them directly. Any significant deviation (e.g., replacing red with green) would alter the source identity.

      "thinking_process": "The **irregular, non-uniform pattern distribution** is a hallmark of the handcrafted nature of the beads—each one is unique. The instruction does not call for uniformity, implying that variation should be preserved. This **asymmetry** helps distinguish the beads from mass-produced items. In the serpent, this variation should be reflected in the **placement and style of patterns** across segments. Its loss would make the creature look artificial.
