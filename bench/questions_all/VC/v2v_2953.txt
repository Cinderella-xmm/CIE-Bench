### Description of Reference Image:
The subject is a cocktail served in a clear glass, placed on a black napkin atop a polished wooden bar surface. The cocktail contains ice cubes and an amber-colored liquid, garnished with a slice of lime resting on the rim of the glass. A metallic straw is inserted into the drink. The background consists of blurred shelves filled with various bottles, suggesting a bar setting. The lighting highlights the clarity of the glass, the transparency of the ice, and the vibrant green of the lime.

### Thinking Process:
#### Allowed Changes List:
- **Specific element 1 that allows for changes:** The material and texture of the cocktail, glass, ice, lime, and straw can be transformed into a hand-sculpted claymation style, altering their appearance to mimic clay textures.
- **Specific element 2 that allows for changes:** The background can be reimagined to complement the claymation theme, potentially replacing the bar setting with a clay-like environment.

#### Preservation Targets List:
**Core Recognition Elements:** The iconic form of the cocktail (glass shape, ice cubes, liquid color, lime garnish, and straw placement) must be retained to ensure the subject remains identifiable as a cocktail.
**Functional/Logical Association Elements:** The spatial arrangement of the glass on the napkin and the napkin on the bar surface should be preserved to maintain logical consistency.
**Remaining Elements:** The polished wooden texture of the bar and the general bar setting should be kept to support visual coherence.
