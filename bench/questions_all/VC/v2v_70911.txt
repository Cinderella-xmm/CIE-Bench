Description of reference image: The subject is a black container of AXE Spiked Up Look Putty. The container is cylindrical with a flat top and bottom. The label on the container prominently displays the AXE logo in silver metallic text, along with the words "SPIKED UP LOOK PUTTY" in a bold font. The label also features an abstract explosive design in fiery red and energetic pink hues. The net weight of the product is indicated as 2.64 oz (75g). The background is plain white, emphasizing the product.

Thinking process: The editing instructions clearly state that the container should appear cracked open, revealing a miniature nebula inside. This means the container's form and contents can be altered. However, the AXE branding, label design, and overall shape of the container must remain consistent to maintain brand recognition. The background can be changed to accommodate the new cosmic theme.

Allowed Changes List:
Specific element 1 that allows for changes: The contents of the container can be replaced with a miniature nebula.
Specific element 2 that allows for changes: The container can be depicted as cracked open.
Specific element 3 that allows for changes: The background can be changed to include distant stars.

Thinking process: Core recognition elements include the AXE logo, the label design, and the container's shape. These elements are crucial for brand identity and must be retained. Functional/logical association elements include the container's intact structure except for the crack, ensuring the product's recognizability as a putty container. Remaining elements like the net weight text and the explosive design colors should be retained for visual coherence.
