      "thinking_process": "The three-tiered wooden table structure with horizontal slats and vertical supports is the core architectural form of the diorama. Its existence defines the scene as a workshop bench rather than a display case or altar. Removing or altering this structure would fundamentally change the object's identity. It is a structural anchor and therefore a key identification feature.",
      "question": "Is the three-tiered wooden table structure with horizontal slats and vertical supports still present?",

        "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The two distinct clay vases—one with a pinched neck and irregular shape, the other more symmetrical—are signature forms that identify the pottery being worked on. Their presence and shape are essential to recognizing the scene as a pottery workshop. Losing either would obscure the intended craft context.",
      "question": "Are both the asymmetrical clay vase with a pinched neck and the symmetrical clay vase still present on the upper tier?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The flat circular clay piece with a central hole is a distinctive component, likely representing a potter’s wheel disk or lid. Its unique shape and position make it an identifiable part of the setup. It contributes to the functional logic of the scene and cannot be replaced without losing authenticity.",
      "question": "Is the flat circular clay piece with a central hole still positioned on the upper tier behind the vases?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The rectangular block of clay on the lower table is a key indicator of raw material in the process of shaping. Its presence supports the narrative of active pottery work. While its color may change due to patina, its shape and location must remain consistent to preserve the scene’s logic.",
      "question": "Is the rectangular block of gray clay still present on the lower table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The white fabric scraps draped over the edge and under the table are minor but visually significant details that add realism and texture to the scene. They suggest cloth used for cleaning or covering tools. Though not central, they contribute to the overall coherence and authenticity of the workshop setting.",
      "question": "Are the white fabric scraps still visible draped over the edge and under the lower table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The modeling tool resembling a wooden rib is a functional accessory indicating active craftsmanship. Its placement next to the clay block suggests use. Removing it would reduce the sense of activity and diminish the workshop feel.",
      "question": "Is the small wooden modeling tool still present on the lower table near the clay block?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The flat wooden base supports the entire structure and grounds it spatially. It is part of the original construction and provides stability. Even if a plaque is added, the base must remain intact to maintain the physical integrity of the diorama.",
      "question": "Is the flat wooden base supporting the entire structure still present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
