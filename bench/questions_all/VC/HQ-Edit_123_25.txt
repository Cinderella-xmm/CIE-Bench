Description of reference image: The subject is a woman viewed from the back-left side, with her head slightly turned to the right, gazing forward. Her dark hair is styled in an elegant updo with loose tendrils framing her face, secured by a silver ornamental hairpin shaped like a stylized leaf or branch with intricate filigree details. She wears a traditional-style teal garment with a high collar and long sleeves, featuring elaborate silver-thread embroidery depicting symmetrical floral and scroll motifs across the back and shoulders. The embroidery includes vine-like patterns with pointed leaves and swirling flourishes, concentrated along the spine and extending outward toward the shoulders. The fabric has a subtle sheen, suggesting silk or satin material. A light blue ribbon is tied at the waist, forming a bow. The background consists of vertical green bamboo stalks, densely packed and softly blurred, creating a natural, serene setting with a sense of depth. Natural daylight illuminates the scene, casting soft shadows and highlighting textures.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions word by word:  
- "Transform the embroidered garment into an elegant art postcard series" → implies reformatting the visual content into postcards, but does **not** require changing the original design of the garment itself; the garment's appearance must be preserved as source material.  
- "Highlighting the intricate embroidery and bamboo backdrop" → explicitly states that both the embroidery and bamboo background are to be emphasized, meaning they must be retained and not replaced.  
- "Use stylized paper-cut effects, enhancing floral and scroll motifs" → allows artistic reinterpretation (e.g., adding cut-out style), but only on top of existing designs; core shapes and positions of motifs must remain recognizable.  
- "Create three postcards: one with a blue gradient emphasizing the dress, another featuring silver tones for the hair accessory, and a third with bamboo patterns" → indicates color filtering and thematic focus per card, but does **not** permit altering the fundamental forms or presence of the elements.  
- "Pack them into a silk-bound collector book with embroidery-inspired cover design" → this is a new container format, not affecting the content of the images themselves.  

Thus, allowed changes include:  
- Color tone adjustments (e.g., blue gradient, silver emphasis)  
- Stylistic overlays (paper-cut effect)  
- Composition cropping for postcard format  
- Arrangement into a book layout  

But **not allowed**:  
- Removal or distortion of key elements such as embroidery patterns, hairpin shape, bamboo background, or figure posture  
- Changing the identity of the subject (e.g., replacing her with another person)  
- Altering structural relationships (e.g., moving the hairpin off the head)  

Allowed Changes List:  
(Specific element 1 that allows for changes): Color tone of the garment (e.g., blue gradient applied)  
(Specific element 2 that allows for changes): Color treatment of the hair accessory (e.g., enhanced silver tone)  
(Specific element 3 that allows for changes): Background rendering (e.g., stylized bamboo pattern overlay)  
(Specific element 4 that allows for changes): Artistic filter application (e.g., paper-cut effect on embroidery)  
(Specific element 5 that allows for changes): Layout composition (e.g., cropping for postcard size)

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements:  
- The **silver filigree hairpin** is a distinctive accessory with a specific botanical design—its shape and placement are critical for identifying the character’s style and cultural context. Even if stylized, its presence and form must be preserved.  
- The **embroidery patterns** on the back of the garment are highly detailed and symmetrical, forming a central visual motif. Their structure (vine-like branches, leaf shapes, scrollwork) defines the aesthetic of the clothing and must remain identifiable.  
- The **bamboo background** is explicitly mentioned as a key element to highlight—it provides environmental context and symbolic resonance. Its vertical alignment and green hue are essential for maintaining scene authenticity.  

Functional/logical association elements:  
- The **position of the hairpin** in the bun is functional: it holds the hairstyle in place. If moved or removed, the hairstyle would collapse logically.  
- The **relationship between the figure and the bamboo**—she stands within the grove, framed by the stalks—creates a spatial logic that should not be disrupted unless explicitly permitted.  

Non-modified element deduction:  
After excluding allowed changes (color filters, paper-cut effects, layout), all **structural features** of the subject and environment must remain intact:  
- Hair shape and arrangement  
- Embroidery motifs’ shapes and symmetry  
- Bamboo stalks' verticality and spacing  
- Figure’s pose and orientation  

Preservation Targets List:  
(The silver filigree hairpin with leaf-like design is present and positioned in the hair bun)  
(The intricate silver embroidery on the back of the teal garment includes symmetrical vine and leaf patterns)  
(The bamboo stalks form a vertical backdrop behind the subject)  
(The subject’s hair is styled in an updo with loose strands near the face)  
(The garment has a high collar and long sleeves with visible stitching detail)  
(The figure is shown in a three-quarter rear view, facing right)

Q1:  
Thinking process: The silver filigree hairpin is a unique identifier of the subject’s traditional attire and personal adornment. Its shape—resembling a branching plant with fine details—is distinct and culturally significant. If altered or removed, the character’s identity and styling would be compromised. This is a core visual feature that must be preserved regardless of stylistic enhancements like paper-cut effects. Therefore, it carries a weight of 3 points.  
Question: Is the silver filigree hairpin shaped like a branching plant with delicate leaf-like extensions still present in the hair bun?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The embroidery on the back of the garment is the central artistic focus of the image. The symmetrical vine-and-leaf pattern, especially the central upward-growing motif flanked by scrolling sides, is the defining characteristic of the clothing. Any loss of this structure would undermine the visual integrity of the piece. While color may shift, the outline and layout must remain consistent. Thus, it is a key identification element with a weight of 3 points.  
Question: Are the symmetrical silver-threaded vine and leaf embroidery patterns clearly visible on the back of the teal garment?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The bamboo background is explicitly required to be highlighted in the postcard series. Its vertical lines and green color define the natural setting and contribute to the overall mood. Even if stylized, the presence of vertical bamboo stalks behind the figure must be maintained. Removing or distorting them would break the intended environmental context. This is a major scene element with a weight of 2 points.  
Question: Are vertical green bamboo stalks visible in the background behind the subject?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The hairstyle—specifically the updo with loose strands near the ear and forehead—is part of the subject’s identity and contributes to the elegance of the portrait. It is a secondary but consistent feature that supports the overall composition. While minor styling changes might be acceptable under transformation, the basic structure of the bun and positioning of loose hair must remain. This is a supporting detail with a weight of 2 points.  
Question: Is the subject’s hair styled in a bun with loose tendrils framing the face and ear?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The garment’s high collar and long sleeves are structural components that define its traditional style. These features distinguish it from modern clothing and are necessary for accurate representation. Even with color shifts or paper-cut effects, the silhouette and collar shape must remain recognizable. This is a functional design element with a weight of 2 points.  
Question: Does the garment have a high collar and long sleeves with visible seam lines?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The figure’s pose—a three-quarter rear view with the head turned slightly to the right—is crucial for conveying the intended composition and emotional tone. It establishes the viewer’s perspective and relationship to the subject. Changing this angle would alter the narrative framing. Though the instruction allows for postcard cropping, the core orientation must be preserved. This is a compositional anchor with a weight of 2 points.  
Question: Is the subject shown in a three-quarter rear view, facing toward the right side of the frame?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The light blue ribbon tied at the waist is a small but noticeable detail that adds balance to the outfit and suggests a traditional fastening method. While not central, it contributes to the authenticity of the costume. Its presence helps maintain visual coherence. This is a minor detail with a weight of 1 point.  
Question: Is there a light blue ribbon tied in a bow at the waist of the garment?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1
