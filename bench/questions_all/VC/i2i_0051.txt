- The scene's lighting and color tones may be adjusted to create a vintage feel.

#### Preservation Targets List:
- The core identity elements include the subjects' actions (shaking hands) and sport-specific items (tennis rackets, balls, and court lines).
- Functional/logical associations include the positioning of the subjects relative to the tennis court and net.
- Remaining elements like the court's overall structure and ball placement help maintain visual coherence.
