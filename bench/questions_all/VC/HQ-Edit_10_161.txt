**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a young African girl standing outdoors in a natural savanna-like environment under clear daylight. She faces forward with a gentle smile, her head slightly tilted. Her skin tone is dark brown, and she has large, expressive eyes with a warm gaze. Her hair is styled in numerous thin braids (dreadlocks), each adorned with colorful beads in red, white, yellow, and black, arranged in repeating patterns along the length of the braids. The braids are neatly coiled upward from the scalp, forming a crown-like structure. She wears large circular hoop earrings made of metal or bone. Around her neck is a multi-layered beaded necklace composed of tightly woven horizontal bands in red, black, blue, and green, forming a wide collar that extends down her chest. Her arms are decorated with multiple bangles on both wrists—stacked bracelets in alternating colors including white, red, yellow, green, and black. She wears a sleeveless dress with a vibrant geometric pattern: the base fabric is turquoise blue, overlaid with orange-brown diamond-shaped motifs containing intricate spiral designs, resembling traditional African textile art. The dress has a flared skirt section with vertical pleats. The background consists of an open landscape with dry earth, sparse green vegetation, and distant hills under a pale blue sky.

**Thinking process:**  
First, parse the editing instruction word by word:  
- “Transform the attire and accessories into an elaborate African tribal art-inspired mosaic” → This implies **replacing** the current clothing and jewelry forms with a **mosaic-style reinterpretation**, but **preserving original geometric patterns**. Therefore, the **patterns** must remain, but the **material form** (fabric, beads) may change.  
- “Reimagine the beaded jewelry as vibrant stained glass tiles” → The **jewelry’s function and placement** (neck, wrists, ears) remain, but their **form and texture** are changed to stained glass; thus, **beads themselves are replaced**, but **their arrangement and color sequence** may be preserved.  
- “Convert the landscape into a tapestry of warm earth tones, capturing Africa's diverse terrains” → The **landscape is to be transformed**, so **background elements like sky, grass, soil, and hills can be altered** in style and texture, though not necessarily in composition.  
- “Retain the colorful hairstyle as a bas-relief sculpture, enhancing the cultural essence” → The **hairstyle must be retained**, but **its form changes to bas-relief**, meaning it becomes sculptural and raised, yet its **colorful bead decoration and overall shape** must remain intact.  
- “Preserving the original geometric patterns” → This is critical: the **geometric motifs on the dress must remain unchanged in design**, even if rendered differently (e.g., in mosaic).  

From this, we deduce:

**Allowed Changes List:**  
- Form of attire (fabric → mosaic)  
- Material of jewelry (beads → stained glass tiles)  
- Background scenery (natural landscape → tapestry-style rendering)  
- Texture and surface of jewelry and clothing (smooth fabric → mosaic, beaded → glass)  
- Visual representation of hairstyle (3D hair → bas-relief sculpture)  
- Rendering style of the entire image (photorealistic → stylized/artistically interpreted)  

**Note:** The instruction does **not** allow changes to the **original geometric patterns** (must be preserved), nor does it allow changes to the **core visual identity of the hairstyle** (must remain colorful and structured), though its physical form can be modified.

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
We now apply exclusion logic based on the "Allowed Changes List" and the original image’s content.

**Core recognition elements:**  
- The **distinctive geometric pattern** on the dress (orange diamonds with spirals on blue) is iconic and culturally symbolic. It is central to the identity of the attire and must be preserved per instruction. Even if transformed into mosaic, the **shape, layout, and internal spiral design** must remain.  
- The **bead color sequence** on the hair (red-white-yellow-black repeating) is a signature detail of the hairstyle. Though the beads may become stained glass tiles, the **color order and placement** must stay consistent to maintain cultural authenticity.  
- The **structure of the hairstyle**: the upward-coiled dreadlocks forming a crown-like shape is unique and identifiable. While it becomes a bas-relief, its **overall silhouette and spatial arrangement** must remain.  
- The **presence and position of jewelry**: the **hoop earrings**, **necklace layers**, and **wrist bangles** must remain in their original locations, even if reimagined as stained glass. Their **placement** is essential for identity.  
- The **subject’s facial features** (eyes, nose, mouth, skin tone) are core to identifying the individual. No instruction suggests altering them, so they must remain unchanged.  
- The **dress’s cut and silhouette** (sleeveless, flared skirt, high neckline) must remain, even if material changes. The **proportions and shape** define the garment’s identity.

**Functional/logical association elements:**  
- The **necklace is worn around the neck**, not floating or misplaced. Its **position relative to the shoulders and chest** must be preserved for logical consistency.  
- The **bangles are stacked on the wrists**, not moved to elbows or ankles. Their **placement** maintains functional logic.  
- The **hair is attached to the scalp**, not floating or detached. The **origin point of the braids** must remain at the head.

**Non-modified element deduction:**  
After excluding allowed changes (materials, textures, rendering style), the following **visual details must remain**:  
- The **exact color palette** of the beads on hair (red, white, yellow, black)  
- The **geometric motif on the dress** (diamonds with spirals)  
- The **number and arrangement** of necklace layers  
- The **design and layering** of wrist bangles  
- The **facial expression and pose** (smiling, facing forward)  
- The **relative proportions** of the body and clothing  

These are not mentioned for change and are necessary for coherence and identity retention.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
- The geometric diamond pattern with spiral centers on the dress  
- The color sequence of beads on the hair (red-white-yellow-black repeating)  
- The crown-like upward coil of the braids  
- The presence and position of the hoop earrings  
- The layered beaded necklace structure around the neck  
- The stacked bangles on both wrists  
- The facial features and expression (smile, eye direction)  
- The sleeveless dress with flared skirt  
- The exact color scheme of the dress (turquoise blue with orange-brown motifs)  
- The natural lighting and outdoor setting (though background style may change, the scene must remain outdoor and sunlit)

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The diamond-shaped pattern with spiral interiors on the dress is the defining cultural and artistic motif. It is the key identifier of the attire's African tribal inspiration. If this pattern is altered or replaced, the cultural essence and identity of the clothing are lost. The instruction explicitly states to preserve the original geometric patterns, making this a core element. Thus, the question directly checks whether the specific pattern remains intact.
    Question: Does the dress retain the exact geometric pattern of orange-brown diamonds with spiral centers on a turquoise blue background?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The bead color sequence on the hair (red-white-yellow-black) is a distinctive cultural marker. The instruction specifies retaining the colorful hairstyle as a bas-relief, implying the colors must remain. Changing the sequence would alter the cultural symbolism. Since the beads are being reimagined as stained glass, their color must still match the original sequence to preserve identity. This is a core identification feature.
    Question: Are the beads on the hair arranged in the same repeating sequence of red, white, yellow, and black as in the original?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The crown-like upward coil of the braids is a structural hallmark of the hairstyle. The instruction allows transformation into bas-relief but requires retention of the cultural essence. The shape of the coils defines the hairstyle’s identity. If the coils are flattened or reshaped, the cultural form is compromised. This is a key structural feature.
    Question: Do the braids maintain their upward-coiled crown-like structure originating from the scalp?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The layered beaded necklace is a prominent accessory. While its material may change to stained glass, its **layered structure** and **position around the neck** are critical. The number of layers and their concentric arrangement define the piece. Losing this would break the visual logic of the jewelry. It is a key accessory element.
    Question: Is the necklace composed of multiple horizontal layers of beads arranged in concentric rings around the neck?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The stacked bangles on both wrists are part of the cultural adornment. Their **presence**, **number**, and **color sequence** (white, red, yellow, green, black) are visually distinct. The instruction does not permit removal or relocation. Even if reimagined as stained glass, their stacking and position must remain. This affects visual balance and cultural accuracy.
    Question: Are there multiple stacked bangles present on both wrists, maintaining the original color sequence and positioning?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The hoop earrings are a signature accessory. Their **circular shape** and **position in the earlobe** are essential. The instruction does not mention removing them, only reimagining materials. Their absence or misplacement would disrupt the subject’s appearance and cultural identity. This is a minor but identifiable detail.
    Question: Are the large circular hoop earrings present in the left earlobe?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}
{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The facial expression and pose are crucial for emotional and identity continuity. The girl’s **smile**, **eye contact**, and **forward-facing posture** are core to the image’s warmth and character. The instruction does not suggest altering these. Any change would affect recognition of the subject.
    Question: Does the girl maintain a smiling expression with direct eye contact and a forward-facing posture?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q8: 
    Thinking process: The dress’s **sleeveless cut** and **flared skirt** define its silhouette. Even if rendered as mosaic, the **shape and structure** must remain. Altering the cut (e.g., adding sleeves) would change the garment’s identity. This is a structural detail critical to the attire’s form.
    Question: Does the dress have a sleeveless top and a flared skirt section with vertical pleats?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
