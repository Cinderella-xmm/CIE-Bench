Description of reference image: The subject is a long sandwich on a piece of white parchment paper, placed on a table covered with a decorated tablecloth. The sandwich has a golden-brown crusty bread filled with visible layers of sliced tomatoes, lettuce, cheese, and possibly other ingredients. There is a knife with a green handle lying next to the sandwich. The background includes subtle patterns on the tablecloth.

### Step 1 - Allowed Changes List:

- Add a holographic projection screen above the sandwich, emerging from an assumed phone (since there is no phone in the image, this means the phone placement would also be part of the edit).
- The projection can display a city map interface.
  
### Step 2 - Preservation Targets List:

Thinking process:
Core recognition elements include the sandwich's distinct shape, fillings, and crust texture, as these define its identity. Functional/logical association elements involve the knife's position since it relates to the context of eating the sandwich. Remaining elements, like the background tablecloth pattern, support visual coherence and should be retained unless specified otherwise.

Preservation Targets List:
(Element 1: Sandwich's crusty texture and brown color)
(Element 2: Visible layers of sandwich fillings)
(Element 3: Position of the knife relative to the sandwich)
(Element 4: Background tablecloth pattern)
