**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is an elderly man with white hair and a full white beard, standing upright in the center of a cobblestone plaza. He wears a long brown tweed overcoat over a cream-colored cable-knit sweater vest, a light blue dress shirt, a dark brown tie, and beige trousers. His right hand holds a wooden walking cane with a carved handle, while his left hand rests in his coat pocket. He stands on a paved stone path surrounding a shallow, oval-shaped reflecting pool. The background features a grand, European-style cityscape at golden hour, with ornate buildings, glowing streetlamps, weeping willow trees, and pedestrians walking along the promenade. A woman sits on a wrought-iron bench to the right, holding a parasol. The lighting is warm and soft, casting long shadows and reflections in the water.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction specifies:  
- Transform the **cane into a golden scepter** → *change allowed*  
- Color the **ensemble in pastel tones** → *change allowed*  
- Position him on a **stylized cobblestone path** → *scene modification allowed*  
- Add **detachable sections for personal notes and stamped details** → *new interactive elements added, not part of original*  

However, the instruction does **not** specify changes to:  
- The **identity or form of the elderly man** (e.g., facial features, posture, clothing structure)  
- The **presence of the reflective pool** (implied by “positioned on a path” but not explicitly altered)  
- The **overall composition of the scene**, though stylized  
- The **functional relationship between the man and the cane/scepter** — even if transformed, it must still be held in the same hand  

Therefore, only **specific components** are permitted to change:  
- The **material and appearance of the cane**  
- The **color palette of the clothing**  
- The **path design**  
- The **addition of interactive elements** (notes/stamps)  

All other visual elements not mentioned as changed are assumed to be retained unless logically incompatible.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
- The material and shape of the cane (transformed into a golden scepter)  
- The color scheme of the man’s clothing (changed to pastel tones)  
- The texture and style of the cobblestone path (stylized version)  
- The addition of detachable note sections and stamped areas (interactive elements)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
Core recognition elements:  
- The **elderly man's face**, especially his **white hair, full white beard, and facial structure**, are key identity markers. Even in cartoon style, these features must remain recognizable to preserve the subject’s identity.  
- The **posture**: standing upright, right hand holding the cane, left hand in pocket — this pose defines the character’s presence and dignity. Changing it would alter the narrative stance.  
- The **clothing silhouette**: the long overcoat, sweater vest, tie, and trousers maintain a distinct formal-dress aesthetic. While colors may shift, the **structure and layering** must remain intact to preserve identity.  
- The **reflective pool** and its **oval shape** are central environmental features anchoring the man’s position; removing or altering it would disrupt spatial logic.  
- The **cobblestone surface beneath his feet** must remain, even if stylized — it supports the ground-level positioning and continuity of the scene.  

Functional/logical association elements:  
- The **man must hold the object in his right hand** — whether cane or scepter — because the action of holding is tied to his posture and balance. This functional relationship must persist.  
- The **relative position of the man to the pool** — he stands at the edge, facing forward — must be preserved to maintain spatial coherence.  

Non-modified element deduction:  
- All **background elements not specified for change** (such as the architecture, streetlamps, trees, pedestrians) are **not required to be preserved**, since the instruction allows for a stylized scene. However, the **existence of the pool and its reflection** must remain due to its central role in framing the subject.  
- The **texture of the stone pavement** around the pool must be preserved in some form, even if stylized, because it defines the ground plane.  

Thus, while the **style** can change (cartoon), the **core identity and spatial relationships** must be retained.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
- The elderly man’s facial features: white hair, full white beard, and distinctive facial structure  
- The man’s upright posture with right hand holding an object and left hand in pocket  
- The layered clothing structure: overcoat, sweater vest, shirt, tie, trousers  
- The oval-shaped reflective pool directly behind the man  
- The cobblestone path under his feet  
- The man’s position at the edge of the pool, facing forward  
- The functional relationship: object held in right hand

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

**Q1:**  
Thinking process: The white beard and hair are core identity features of the elderly man. These are unique identifiers that distinguish him from other characters. In any artistic transformation, including cartoon style, their presence is essential for recognition. Losing them would make the figure unrecognizable as the original subject. Therefore, this is a 3-point question.  
Question: Is the elderly man depicted with a full white beard and white hair?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

**Q2:**  
Thinking process: The upright posture with the right hand holding an object and the left hand in the pocket is a defining compositional feature. It conveys dignity and balance. Any deviation would alter the character’s demeanor and spatial logic. This is a critical structural element, thus weighted 3 points.  
Question: Is the man standing upright with his right hand holding an object and his left hand in his coat pocket?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

**Q3:**  
Thinking process: The layered clothing structure — overcoat, sweater vest, shirt, tie, and trousers — defines the man’s formal attire. While colors may change to pastel tones, the **structure and order** of garments must remain to preserve identity. Altering the layering would misrepresent the original outfit. This is a key identity element, hence 3 points.  
Question: Does the man wear a long overcoat over a sweater vest, shirt, tie, and trousers?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

**Q4:**  
Thinking process: The oval-shaped reflective pool is a central environmental anchor. It frames the subject and reflects the ambient light. Its presence establishes the setting and spatial context. Removing or distorting it would break the scene’s coherence. Though stylized, its shape and function must remain. Thus, it is a 2-point element.  
Question: Is there an oval-shaped reflective pool directly behind the man?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

**Q5:**  
Thinking process: The cobblestone path under the man’s feet grounds him in the scene and maintains continuity with the environment. Even if stylized, the path must exist to preserve spatial logic. Its absence would disconnect the figure from the setting. This is an important scene element, so it receives 2 points.  
Question: Is the man standing on a cobblestone path?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

**Q6:**  
Thinking process: The man’s position at the edge of the pool, facing forward, is crucial for the composition. It ensures visual balance and directs focus. Moving him away from the pool or changing his orientation would disrupt the intended framing. This is a logical spatial relationship, thus 2 points.  
Question: Is the man positioned at the edge of the pool, facing forward?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

**Q7:**  
Thinking process: The object in the man’s right hand must be held in the same manner regardless of transformation (cane → scepter). The act of holding is functional and compositional. If the hand were empty or the object misplaced, the action would be lost. This is a functional association, hence 2 points.  
Question: Is the man holding an object in his right hand?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

**Q8:**  
Thinking process: The texture of the stone pavement around the pool contributes to the realism and grounding of the scene. While it may be stylized, its existence as a paved surface must be preserved. This is a minor detail but supports visual consistency. Thus, it is a 1-point element.  
Question: Is the ground around the pool made of stone or cobblestone material?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1
