      "thinking_process": "The side-profile view facing right is a core identity feature of this particular representation of Apollo. In classical sculpture, the direction of gaze and pose are essential for recognition and stylistic continuity. Changing the orientation would fundamentally alter the viewer's perception and break the reference to the original work. Therefore, preserving the profile direction is critical and carries a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the bust oriented in a side profile facing to the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The inscription \"APOLLO\" on the base is a definitive identifier of the subject. It is a textual and positional anchor that links the sculpture to its mythological identity. Even if stylized or integrated into a steampunk aesthetic, the presence and location of this label must be maintained to preserve the work's identity. Loss of this element would render the subject ambiguous, hence its weight is 3 points.",
      "question": "Is there an inscribed plaque on the base with the word \"APOLLO\" visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The anatomical proportions of the bust—specifically the length of the neck, width of the shoulders, and curvature of the chest—are essential for maintaining the realistic human form characteristic of classical sculptures. Altering these could distort the figure beyond recognition as a classical male ideal. These proportions serve as a foundational structure upon which modifications (like mechanical additions) are built, making them critical for consistency. Thus, they are assigned a weight of 2 points.",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the neck, shoulders, and chest consistent with the original sculptural form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The drapery’s placement over the left shoulder and across the chest is a key compositional feature. Although the material may be replaced with metallic fabric, its path and coverage must remain unchanged to preserve the original gesture and balance. This spatial arrangement contributes to the visual harmony and identity of the piece. Therefore, retaining the drapery’s position is important but not absolute in identity, warranting a weight of 2 points.",
      "question": "Does the drapery extend from the left shoulder across the chest in a diagonal fold?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The pedestal’s cylindrical form with a flat top and rounded base provides structural support and defines the presentation format of the bust. While decorative elements like gears may be added, the basic shape and function must remain intact. Any significant deviation would disrupt the visual logic of how the bust is displayed. This is a secondary but important detail, thus assigned a weight of 1 point.",
      "question": "Is the base a cylindrical pedestal with a flat top and rounded bottom?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The presence of a small circular ornament on the left shoulder of the drapery is a subtle but distinctive detail that adds to the authenticity of the classical attire. Though minor, it contributes to the historical accuracy and visual richness of the original. If removed or replaced without integration, it could reduce the fidelity of the transformation. Hence, it is a detail-level retention worth 1 point.",
      "question": "Is there a small circular medallion or button-like ornament on the left shoulder of the drapery?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
