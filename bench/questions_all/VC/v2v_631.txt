### Step 1 - Description of Reference Image and Allowed Changes List:

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a person with vibrant purple hair styled in a shoulder-length bob cut. They wear gold hoop earrings and a sleeveless black top. The background is plain and neutral, providing no distractions. The subject's expression is neutral, and their gaze is directed straight ahead. The lighting is even, highlighting the subject's features and the vivid color of their hair.

**Thinking process:**  
The instructions specify transforming the image into a 3D cartoon style while incorporating programmer-related elements and stats. The subject's core identity (purple hair, black outfit, and gold earrings) should be retained. The background can be replaced with a programming-themed design. The subject's pose and expression can be slightly adjusted to fit the new style.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
- Convert the image into a warm-lit 3D cartoon aesthetic.  
- Replace the plain background with a programming-themed design.  
- Adjust the subject's pose and expression to match the new style.  
- Incorporate programmer-related tools/icons and stats into the artwork.  
- Add a title banner and nameplate with polished borders.

### Step 2 - Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged:

**Thinking process:**  
Core recognition elements include the subject's purple hair, black outfit, and gold earrings, as these are distinctive features that define the subject's identity. Functional/logical association elements include the subject's neutral expression and direct gaze, which convey confidence and self-assurance. Remaining elements like the subject's skin tone and general proportions should also be retained for visual coherence.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
- Purple hair color and shoulder-length bob cut.  
- Gold hoop earrings.  
- Black sleeveless top.  
- Neutral expression and direct gaze.  
- Subject's skin tone and general proportions.
