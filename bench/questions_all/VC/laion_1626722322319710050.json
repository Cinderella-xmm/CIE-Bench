      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "The raised hand gesture is a core identification feature of the statue, distinguishing it from other figures. This pose is central to the figure's identity and symbolic meaning (possibly a blessing or proclamation). If the hand is lowered or repositioned, the figure’s identity and intent are lost. Thus, preserving this specific gesture is essential for recognition and consistency.",
      "question": "Is the statue’s right hand raised in a gesture with fingers extended upward?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The beard and long hair are distinctive facial features that define the figure’s appearance and likely religious or historical identity. Altering or removing them would make the figure unrecognizable as the same entity. These traits are iconic and cannot be changed without losing identity.",
      "question": "Does the statue have a visible beard and long hair on the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The flowing robe with pronounced drapery folds is a defining visual characteristic of the statue’s clothing. Its shape and flow contribute to the figure’s dignity and period-specific style. Changing the fabric’s form or eliminating folds would distort the figure’s appearance and historical context.",
      "question": "Are there clearly visible folds and drapes in the robe covering the statue’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The year “1882” inscribed on the front of the base is a key historical detail that anchors the monument in time. Its presence and legibility are crucial for maintaining the work’s authenticity and informational value. Removing or altering it would erase a significant part of the monument’s identity.",
      "question": "Is the year “1882” visibly inscribed on the front face of the pedestal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The black plaque at the base is a functional element containing likely commemorative text. Its presence indicates a formal dedication or historical note. Even if resized or stylized in the miniature version, its existence must be preserved to retain the monument’s narrative purpose.",
      "question": "Is there a dark rectangular plaque affixed to the lower front section of the base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The statue’s vertical positioning atop the pedestal is a structural and compositional necessity. It reflects the monument’s intended display and spatial hierarchy. If the figure is placed sideways or detached from the base, the relationship is broken, undermining the original design logic.",
      "question": "Is the statue positioned directly on top of the pedestal, aligned vertically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
