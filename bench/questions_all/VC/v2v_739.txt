Description of reference image: The subject is a young woman sitting cross-legged on a sidewalk, facing slightly toward the camera with her head tilted downward as she looks at a smartphone held in both hands. Her long, wavy brown hair falls naturally over her shoulders and back. She wears a light beige knitted cardigan over a black crew-neck t-shirt, paired with dark blue skinny jeans. The texture of the cardigan is visible, showing fine knit patterns and soft folds. The jeans have a realistic denim texture with subtle creases and stitching details along the seams. Her posture is relaxed, with her knees bent and feet tucked beneath her. The smartphone is black, rectangular, with a visible front-facing camera cutout at the top left corner of the screen. The background consists of an urban street scene: a paved road to the left, a curb separating it from the sidewalk, and blurred buildings with brick facades and greenery in the distance. The lighting is natural daylight, casting soft shadows under her arms and legs.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions that explicitly transform the subject into a 3D chibi-style cartoon character dressed in traditional Chinese wedding attire. This indicates that the **form, clothing, hairstyle, accessories, and overall style** of the person are to be changed. The instruction specifies replacing the outfit entirely with a red xiuhe dress, phoenix crown, and floral ornaments—thus, all current clothing and hairstyle elements are within the allowed change scope. The backdrop is also specified to be replaced with a folk-style “囍” paper-cut design, meaning the original urban street background is not required to be preserved. However, the instruction does **not** mention altering the identity or core physical features of the individual (e.g., facial structure, skin tone, eye shape), nor does it suggest changing the pose or orientation of the figure beyond stylization. Since the transformation is stylistic and thematic rather than identity-altering, certain **core visual identifiers** of the original subject must still be retained for consistency, even if rendered in a new art style.

Allowed Changes List:
- Hairstyle (length, color, curl) — can be changed
- Clothing (type, color, texture) — can be changed
- Accessories (earrings, jewelry) — can be changed
- Background environment (urban street, buildings, pavement) — can be changed
- Overall artistic style (realistic photo → 3D chibi cartoon) — allowed
- Pose and posture — may be stylized but not fundamentally altered (e.g., seated position, hand placement)
- Facial expression — may be adapted to match joyful theme, but core facial structure should remain recognizable

Step 2- Determine the elements that should remain unchanged  
Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements: The original subject is a human female with distinct facial features—specifically, the **shape of the eyes**, **nose**, **mouth**, and **overall facial structure**—which serve as key identifiers for recognizing the individual. Even in a stylized chibi form, these features must retain their essential proportions and spatial relationships to maintain identity continuity. For example, the **slightly upturned corners of the mouth** and **downward gaze** are expressive cues tied to the original emotion and identity. These are not mentioned as changeable, so they must be preserved in form, though possibly exaggerated in style.

Functional/logical association elements: The **hand positioning**—holding the phone with both hands—is a functional action that supports the narrative of using a smartphone. While the phone itself will be replaced by thematic elements (e.g., symbolic objects in a wedding context), the **gesture of holding something in both hands** may need to be preserved in logic, especially if the chibi version retains a similar interaction. However, since the instruction does not require retaining the phone’s function, this is not strictly necessary unless implied by continuity.

Non modified element deduction: After excluding all elements listed as changeable (clothing, hair, background, etc.), the remaining unmentioned aspects include:
- The **facial structure** (eye shape, nose bridge, jawline)
- The **skin tone** (light to medium, natural undertone)
- The **position and orientation of the head** (tilted down, looking forward)
- The **seated posture** (cross-legged, knees bent, body angled slightly forward)
- The **presence of the left ear stud earring** (small, gold-colored)

These are not specified for modification and are part of the original visual identity. They must be retained in some form in the edited image to preserve coherence with the original subject.

Preservation Targets List:  
- The facial structure including the shape of the eyes, nose, and mouth  
- The skin tone and natural complexion  
- The seated cross-legged posture with knees bent and body leaning forward  
- The downward tilt of the head and direction of gaze  
- The presence of the small gold stud earring in the left ear  

Q1:  
Thinking process: The shape of the eyes is a core recognition feature of the subject. In the original image, the eyes are almond-shaped with visible eyelashes and a soft downward gaze. This specific eye shape is critical for identifying the individual, especially when transitioning to a stylized form. If the eyes are altered in shape (e.g., made rounder or larger without preserving the original contour), the identity becomes unrecognizable. Therefore, the eye shape must be preserved in the chibi version, even if simplified. This is a key identifier, making it a 3-point question.  
Question: Are the eyes almond-shaped with a downward gaze, maintaining their original proportion and orientation?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The nose has a defined bridge and tip, forming a distinctive profile that contributes to facial recognition. In chibi styles, noses are often minimized, but if the original nose shape is completely lost (e.g., replaced with a dot or absent), the face loses its identity. Preserving the general shape and position of the nose ensures continuity. This is a core facial feature, thus weighted at 3 points.  
Question: Is the nose present with a visible bridge and tip, positioned centrally between the eyes and mouth?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The mouth has a slight upward curve at the corners, indicating a gentle smile. This expression is a defining emotional cue and part of the subject's identity. Even in a stylized version, the curvature and position of the lips must be retained to preserve the original mood and recognition. Losing this would alter the emotional tone and identity. This is a key facial feature, hence 3 points.  
Question: Does the mouth have a subtle upward curve at the corners, forming a gentle smile?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The seated cross-legged posture is a structural element that defines the subject’s position in space. It is not mentioned as changeable, and altering it (e.g., standing or lying down) would break the continuity of the scene. While the chibi version may simplify the limbs, the basic pose—knees bent, legs crossed, body leaning forward—must be preserved to maintain logical consistency. This is an important scene-related element, so it is weighted at 2 points.  
Question: Is the subject seated cross-legged with knees bent and body leaning forward?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The small gold stud earring in the left ear is a minor but identifiable detail. It is not mentioned in the editing instructions as being removed or changed, and its presence adds authenticity to the original image. In the chibi version, while accessories may be replaced, the existence of an earring in the same ear location should be preserved to maintain visual coherence. This is a detail-level element, so it is weighted at 1 point.  
Question: Is there a small gold stud earring visible in the left ear?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The skin tone is a fundamental attribute of the subject’s appearance. The original image shows a light to medium skin tone with natural undertones. Changing this significantly (e.g., to a pale or dark tone) would alter the identity. While chibi styles may use flat colors, the base skin tone should remain consistent. This is a core identity feature, so it is weighted at 3 points.  
Question: Is the skin tone light to medium with natural undertones, consistent with the original image?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The head is tilted downward with the gaze directed at the phone. This orientation is crucial for conveying the original action and focus. Even in a stylized version, the head should maintain this angle to preserve the narrative of engagement with the device. This is a key pose element, so it is weighted at 2 points.  
Question: Is the head tilted downward with the gaze directed forward and slightly down?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2
