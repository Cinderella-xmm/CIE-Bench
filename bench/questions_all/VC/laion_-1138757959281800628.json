      "thinking_process": "The orange vertical structural beams are a defining architectural feature of the hotel, clearly visible along each corner and side of the building. Their presence and placement are critical for identifying the building’s unique design. If removed or altered in color or form, the structure would no longer be recognizable as the original. This is a core identity element, hence weight 3.",
      "question": "Are the orange vertical support beams still present along the edges of the hotel building?",

      "thinking_process": "The light blue lower section of the hotel is a signature color feature that distinguishes it from other buildings. It forms the base of the structure and is visually prominent. Altering its color or removing it would change the building’s identity. This is a core recognition element, thus weight 3.",
      "question": "Is the lower part of the hotel building still painted in light blue?",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The white columns supporting the ground floor are structurally and aesthetically significant, forming a covered entrance area. They are integral to the building’s architectural style and must remain to preserve functional and visual logic. Removing or altering them would disrupt the building’s appearance and spatial coherence. This is a key structural element, hence weight 3.",
      "question": "Are the white columns supporting the ground floor of the hotel still visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The kidney-shaped swimming pool is a central feature of the scene and its distinct outline is crucial for spatial recognition. Even if stylized with layered water effects, its shape must remain unchanged to maintain scene consistency. This is a major environmental feature, so weight 2.",
      "question": "Is the swimming pool still kidney-shaped in outline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The blue sun loungers are uniformly placed around the pool and are a key component of the resort atmosphere. Their presence and arrangement help identify the leisure function of the space. Although they may be scaled down, their color and position must be preserved. This is an important scene detail, hence weight 2.",
      "question": "Are the blue sun loungers still arranged around the perimeter of the pool?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The green-and-white striped umbrellas are distinctive due to their pattern and brand visibility (\"San Marino\" logo). Their presence contributes to the authentic resort feel and branding. Even if miniaturized, they must remain identifiable. This is a minor but recognizable detail, hence weight 1.",
      "question": "Are the green-and-white striped umbrellas still visible near the poolside?",
      "choices": [

      "thinking_process": "The presence of people sunbathing and swimming is essential to convey the resort activity. While they may be miniaturized, their existence and general positions (e.g., lying on loungers, floating in the pool) must be retained to maintain narrative logic. This is a functional scene element, hence weight 2.",
      "question": "Are there still people visible sunbathing on loungers or swimming in the pool?",

    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "thinking_process": "The relative position of the pool directly in front of the hotel building establishes spatial logic. If the pool were moved or reoriented, the scene would lose coherence. This spatial relationship is foundational, hence weight 3.",
      "question": "Is the swimming pool still positioned directly in front of the hotel building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
