### Step 1 - Description of Reference Image & Allowed Changes List:

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a woman with shoulder-length dark hair smiling at the camera, holding three teddy bears in front of her. The teddy bears are dressed in red shirts with white text messages printed on them ("thinking of you makes me smile," "best friend forever," and "could you use a hug today?"). The woman has a light complexion, and she's wearing a checkered black and white jacket. The background is simple with a beige wall and part of a beige and white striped blanket visible behind her. The overall scene suggests a warm and friendly atmosphere.

**Thinking process:**  
Instructions specify transforming the image into a soft illustration style for a friendship-themed greeting card cover while retaining certain elements. This allows for changes in artistic style, but not in key visual elements or compositions as described. Elements such as the number of teddy bears, their positions, and the text on their shirts should remain consistent. The addition of handwritten text at the top is a new piece of information that needs to be integrated into the illustration. 

**Allowed Changes List:**  
- Conversion to an illustration-style drawing.
- Addition of handwritten text at the top as specified (“Some friends come with hugs”).
- Adjustment of the overall tone to make it warm and cozy.

### Step 2 - Determining Elements That Should Remain Unchanged:

**Thinking process:**  
**Core Recognition Elements:** The woman’s presence, her smile, and her interaction with the teddy bears are vital for the image's identity. The teddy bears’ distinct colors, shapes, and the messages on their shirts are also crucial visual identifiers. These elements must be preserved to maintain the theme of friendship and warmth.

**Functional/Logical Association Elements:** The positioning of the bears in front of the woman indicates a sense of companionship and must remain intact. The background setting should remain simple, emphasizing the central subject and the bears.

**Remaining Elements Based on Visual Coherence:** Subtle features like the woman's attire and the background's general appearance should be preserved to keep visual consistency.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
- The presence of the woman and her smile.  
- The three teddy bears with distinct shirt messages.  
- The overall arrangement of the bears in front of the woman.  
- The simplicity of the background.  
- The woman's checkered black-and-white jacket.
