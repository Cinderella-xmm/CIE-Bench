      "thinking_process": "The rectangular body shape with rounded corners is the fundamental structural identity of the bag. This form distinguishes it from other styles such as clutches or tote bags. Even if the pattern and materials change, altering the silhouette would fundamentally misrepresent the object. It is a core identity feature, thus weighted at 3.",
      "question": "Is the bag still rectangular in shape with rounded corners?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The flap-over front closure with a visible horizontal crease is a defining design element of this particular bag model. It separates the bag into distinct sections and contributes to its recognizability. Removing or flattening this flap would alter its functional and aesthetic identity. This is an important structural detail, hence weighted at 2.",
      "question": "Does the bag retain a flap-over front section with a horizontal crease?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The top zipper with a gold-tone pull tab is a functional and identifiable feature. Its position across the top edge defines the closure method. Changing its location or removing it would affect usability and recognition. Although the pattern may change, the zipper's presence and placement must remain. This is a key functional element, so it is assigned 3 points.",
      "question": "Is there a zipper running across the top edge of the bag with a visible gold-tone pull tab?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The two vertical stitched panels beneath the flap are distinctive design features that contribute to the bag’s structured look and segmentation. They are part of the original construction and help identify the model. Altering or removing these would disrupt the visual continuity. This is a significant design detail, thus weighted at 2.",
      "question": "Are there two vertical stitched panels visible beneath the flap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The adjustable shoulder strap with brass-colored buckles on both ends is essential for functionality and style. The strap’s attachment points and buckle design are specific to the original model. Even if stylized with metallic accents, the existence and positioning of the strap must remain. This is a critical accessory component, so it is weighted at 2.",
      "question": "Does the bag have an adjustable shoulder strap with brass-colored buckles on both ends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The position and orientation of the bag—horizontal, upright, centered—establish its presentation context. While the background may be neutral, the bag’s placement relative to the frame helps maintain consistency. Although not a core identity feature, changing its angle or tilt could affect perception of balance and form. This is a minor but coherent detail, thus weighted at 1.",
      "question": "Is the bag positioned horizontally and upright in the center of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
