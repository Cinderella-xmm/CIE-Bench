      "thinking_process": "The shimmering reflection of sunlight on the water is a key identifying feature of the original image. Even when transformed into a dragon’s mane, the **translucent, sparkling quality** must be preserved to maintain visual continuity. If the light reflections are absent or dull, the transformation loses connection to the original scene’s luminosity. This is a core visual trait tied to the image’s atmosphere and realism, making it a high-weight element.",
      "question": "Is there visible sunlight reflecting off the water surface, creating bright sparkles and highlights?",

      "thinking_process": "The green moss or algae growing on the rocks is a distinctive textural detail that adds biological realism to the scene. In the transformed dragon, these patches should manifest as **green-tinted scales or organic markings**, preserving the original’s naturalism. Removing or altering this green coloring would disconnect the dragon from its origin, weakening the thematic link. This is a critical detail for authenticity.",

      "thinking_process": "The white foam created by the turbulent water is a defining characteristic of the waterfall’s motion. In the edit, this becomes the **cloud-like wings**, so its **white color and fluffy texture** must be retained. If the foam is rendered in another color or lacks volume, the transformation fails to honor the original’s dynamics. This is a key element of the water’s behavior.",
      "question": "Is there white, foamy water at the base of the cascade and along the edges of the flow?",

      "thinking_process": "The layered, uneven structure of the rocks defines the topography of the scene. Even when reshaped into a dragon’s armored body, the **stacked, jagged appearance** of the stones should be reflected in the scale pattern. Preserving this structural rhythm ensures the fantasy form still echoes the original geology. It is a secondary but important coherence element.",
      "question": "Do the rocks exhibit a layered, stepped formation with visible cracks and erosion lines?",

      "thinking_process": "The direction of water flow — from top to bottom — is central to the image’s composition. The dragon must emerge **from below**, mirroring the water’s upward trajectory, maintaining the sense of rising motion. Reversing or flattening this direction would break the narrative logic of the transformation. This is a spatial logic element vital to consistency.",
      "question": "Does the water flow downward from the upper part of the image toward the lower part?",

      "thinking_process": "The contrast between the dark wet rock surfaces and the bright, rushing water creates depth and drama. This **contrast in tone and texture** must be preserved in the dragon’s design — e.g., darker scales vs. glowing mane. Losing this contrast would flatten the image visually. It is a compositional detail that supports the original’s aesthetic.",

      "thinking_process": "The presence of airborne water droplets and spray near the cascade indicates the force of the flow. These tiny particles add realism and motion. In the dragon form, similar **fine mist or particle effects** should appear around the mane or wings. Their absence would reduce the sense of dynamic energy. This is a minor but perceptible detail.",
      "question": "Are there visible water droplets or mist suspended in the air above the falling water?",
