    Description of reference image: The subject of the image is a dog, captured from a slightly low angle, focusing on its face and the tennis ball it interacts with. The dog has light-colored fur, and its head and part of the upper body are visible. The dog is positioned near a green tennis ball with a pink stripe around its center, which appears to be the focus of its attention. In the background, several other blurred tennis balls are scattered on a carpeted floor with a neutral tone. The dogâ€™s posture suggests it is crouched or sitting while observing the ball closely.

    Thinking process:  
    The editing instructions clearly specify transforming the dog into a chibi-style blind box figure with an enlarged head and placing the ball near its nose. Also, a base with a relief tennis ball pattern must be added. The dog's pose remains consistent, focused on the ball. The primary focus is on the dog and the tennis ball interaction, not the scene details. 

    Allowed Changes List:
    Specific element 1 that allows for changes: Transform the dog into a chibi-style blind box figure.
    Specific element 2 that allows for changes: Adjust the dog's head size and placement relative to the tennis ball.
    Specific element 3 that allows for changes: Add a new base with a relief tennis ball pattern.

    Thinking process:  
    Core recognition elements include the dog's interaction with the tennis ball and the ball's distinctive green color with a pink stripe. Functional/logical elements involve maintaining the dog's focus on the ball, ensuring the action is coherent post-transformation. Remaining visual details like the ball's texture and the dog's posture in relation to the ball need to be retained for coherence.

    Preservation Targets List: 
    (The dog's prone, ball-focused pose)
    (The green tennis ball with a pink stripe)
    (The relative positioning of the dog and the tennis ball)

    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The relative positioning of the dog and the tennis ball is critical for maintaining the scene's logical coherence. If altered, it would disrupt the intended interaction.
    Question: Is the dog's pose still focused on the tennis ball, with the ball near its nose?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3

    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The green tennis ball with a pink stripe is a distinctive visual element that helps identify the scene. Losing this feature would significantly impact scene recognition.
    Question: Does the tennis ball retain its green color with a pink stripe?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2

    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The dog's attention towards the ball is a key part of the image's narrative; this functional link must be retained despite the stylistic transformation.
    Question: Is the dog still depicted as observing or interacting with the tennis ball?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2

    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The posture of the dog, though transformed into a chibi-style, should still convey that it is in a prone position focused on the ball.
    Question: Does the dog's posture still reflect a prone, ball-focused position?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1

    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The texture of the tennis ball contributes to the realism and identity of the object. Maintaining this texture ensures consistency with the original image.
    Question: Is the texture of the tennis ball (felt-like surface) still present?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
