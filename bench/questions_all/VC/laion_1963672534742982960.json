      "thinking_process": "The bright blue eyes are a distinctive and unique feature of the original figure, serving as a core identification marker. In fantasy or mythological depictions, such vividly colored eyes often signify otherworldliness or magical nature. Altering their color or removing them would fundamentally change the character’s identity. Thus, preserving the blue iris color is essential for maintaining recognition.",
      "question": "Are the eyes of the figure still bright blue with clearly visible irises?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The deeply etched wrinkles and cracked texture across the face are central to the figure’s aged, stone-like appearance. This texture is not merely decorative but defines the character’s aesthetic and perceived age/origin. Removing or smoothing these lines would make the figure appear younger or less authentic, undermining its core visual identity.",
      "question": "Is the facial texture still characterized by deep, horizontal and vertical wrinkles and a cracked, stone-like pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The long, flowing white hair is a prominent feature that frames the face and contributes significantly to the figure’s mystical or ancient appearance. While the instruction allows for styling changes, it explicitly requires retention of the long hair. Therefore, the hair must remain present and extend beyond the shoulders in some form, even if stylized.",
      "question": "Is the figure still shown with long, white hair extending past the shoulders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The full white beard is a defining facial feature that complements the hair and enhances the aged, wise appearance. It is a consistent part of the original image and not mentioned as something to be removed. Even in chibi form, a stylized version of the beard must be present to maintain continuity.",
      "question": "Does the figure still have a full, white beard covering the lower face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The structural outline of the face — including the jawline, cheekbones, and nasal bridge — forms the foundation of the figure’s identity. Even if transformed into chibi style, the basic proportions and placement of these features must be preserved to ensure the character remains recognizable. Changing the shape of the nose or jaw would distort the likeness.",
      "question": "Are the facial contours, including the jawline and cheekbones, still clearly defined and consistent with the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The neck region, though currently textured like cracked stone, is specified in the instruction to retain a \"muscled neckline.\" This suggests the neck must maintain a sense of definition and volume, even if stylized. While the texture may change under icy armor, the underlying shape and prominence of the neck must remain intact.",
      "question": "Is the neck still visibly defined and structured, showing a clear transition from head to torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
