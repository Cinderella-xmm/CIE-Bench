      "thinking_process": "The central muscular figure is the core identity feature of the design. Its bent-forward pose with one arm raised is distinctive and defines the action and character of the subject. This pose is critical for recognition; if altered significantly (e.g., standing upright or arms down), the figure would no longer match the original. Thus, preserving the posture is essential for identity retention, making it a 3-point question.",
      "question": "Is the central figure depicted in a bent-forward pose with one arm raised and the other supporting the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The circular emblem on the chest is a unique identifying symbol within the design. It contains wavy internal lines and is positioned directly over the sternum. Its presence and placement are consistent across the original and serve as a focal point. Removing or relocating it would alter the symbolic meaning and disrupt visual coherence. Hence, it is a key element worth 3 points.",
      "question": "Is there a circular emblem with wavy internal lines located on the chest of the central figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The diamond-shaped frame encloses the figure and serves as a structural boundary for the entire composition. It is formed by intersecting geometric lines and borders that contain the figure and surrounding patterns. Altering its shape or removing it would fundamentally change the layout and visual hierarchy. As a core compositional element, it must be preserved, assigning it a weight of 3.",
      "question": "Is the central figure enclosed within a diamond-shaped geometric frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The floral motif in the top-left corner is a recurring decorative element in the design, contributing to the symmetry and balance. While the instruction allows reimagining patterns, it does not specify removal of individual motifs. Since this flower is part of the original framing, its presence helps maintain visual consistency. Though not the most critical, its loss would affect detail fidelity, so it is assigned 2 points.",
      "question": "Is there a floral motif located in the top-left corner of the design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Stars appear near the upper shoulders of the figure, integrated into the patterned border. They are small but distinct celestial symbols that contribute to the mythological theme. Their placement is specific and intentional. While the instruction allows reimagining patterns, it does not allow deletion of key symbols. Preserving their presence maintains thematic integrity, justifying a 2-point weight.",
      "question": "Are there star symbols located near the upper shoulders of the central figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The long, wavy hair of the figure is a defining characteristic that contributes to its identity and aesthetic. While the instruction may allow stylistic reinterpretation (e.g., simplification), the hair must still be present and flowing in a similar manner to retain the figureâ€™s appearance. Its absence would make the figure unrecognizable. Therefore, it is a critical feature worth 3 points.",
      "question": "Does the central figure have long, wavy hair flowing over the shoulders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
