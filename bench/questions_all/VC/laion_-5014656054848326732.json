      "thinking_process": "The man's facial features—specifically the **black-framed glasses**, **trimmed beard**, and **upward gaze**—are central to his identity. These are not mentioned in the editing instruction as being changed, and they serve as key identifiers distinguishing him from other characters. Losing them would make the figure unrecognizable as the same individual. The glasses have a distinct rectangular shape and reflective lenses, which are unique visual markers. Therefore, their retention is critical.",
      "question": "Are the black-framed glasses with rectangular lenses and visible reflections on the lenses still present on the man's face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The **beard and mustache** form a distinctive facial hair pattern that contributes significantly to the man’s identity. The shape, density, and trim are consistent in the original image and are not referenced for alteration. Changing this would alter the subject’s appearance fundamentally, making it difficult to recognize the same person. It is a core feature of his identity.",
      "question": "Is the trimmed beard and mustache, particularly the defined jawline coverage and upper lip growth, still present on the man's face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The **hair style**—with its textured, swept-back, light brown waves—is a defining characteristic of the subject’s appearance. While the instruction does not specify changing hair, it also does not allow for arbitrary styling. Since no mention is made of replacing or altering it, and it is a prominent feature, it should be preserved. Altering it would risk misidentifying the subject.",
      "question": "Is the light brown, textured, swept-back hairstyle with visible volume and side-parting still present on the man's head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The **hand position**—specifically the right hand resting near the writing device and the left hand slightly raised—indicates engagement with a writing task. Though the device changes from typewriter to book, the **functional posture** of the hands should remain consistent to preserve logical continuity. The fingers appear poised for typing or writing, suggesting an active mental state. This spatial arrangement is important for maintaining the scene’s narrative logic.",
      "question": "Are both hands positioned near the writing object (book), with the right hand showing a grip-like pose and the left hand partially extended toward the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The **table surface** is a flat, white plane that provides a neutral base for the scene. Its clean, uncluttered appearance and reflective quality under lighting are part of the original composition. Although the objects on it change, the **surface itself** is a structural anchor. If it were altered in texture or color, it would disrupt the visual coherence of the scene. Its retention ensures spatial consistency.",
      "question": "Is the table surface still a flat, white, matte plane with soft reflections and no visible texture or pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The **lighting direction** creates a soft shadow on the right side of the man’s face and shirt, with highlights on the left cheek and collar. This directional lighting defines the three-dimensional form and depth of the image. Changing it would alter the mood and perception of the subject. Since no instruction mentions altering lighting, it should be preserved to maintain visual fidelity.",
      "question": "Is the lighting still coming from the front-left, creating a soft highlight on the left side of the face and a subtle shadow on the right side of the neck and shoulder?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The **posture**—seated, leaning slightly forward, head tilted upward and to the right—reflects a contemplative state. This body language is crucial to the narrative of thoughtfulness. Although the chair changes, the **body angle and orientation** should remain consistent to preserve the emotional tone and intent of the image. Changing the posture would shift the meaning of the scene.",
      "question": "Is the man still seated with his torso slightly leaned forward, head tilted upward and to the right, eyes looking up and away?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "thinking_process": "The **presence of a writing-related object** on the table is implied by the original typewriter and is confirmed by the instruction to replace it with a book. While the object changes, the **function** (writing activity) and **placement** (on the table, in front of the man) must be preserved. This maintains the logical context of the scene. The book must be open, large, and leather-bound, but the **fact that there is a book on the table** is a required outcome.",
      "question": "Is there a large, open, leather-bound book placed on the table directly in front of the man?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
