### Description of reference image:
The subject consists of two large side-by-side stainless steel refrigerators in a modern kitchen setting. Each refrigerator has a double-door design with built-in water and ice dispensers on the freezer doors. The cabinets above the refrigerators are dark gray with a traditional shaker-style door design. To the left of the refrigerators, there is a small kitchen counter with various items, including jars and a fruit bowl, under a white-tiled backsplash. On the right side, there is another countertop with a small potted plant and nearby windows letting in natural light. The flooring is light wood laminate.

### Thinking process:
Analyzing the editing instructions, the primary goal is to create a product display featuring multiple views of the refrigerators, without altering their core identity. The form, structure, and visual characteristics of the refrigerators should remain intact. The background, however, can be adjusted or replaced to suit a product display setup. Scene-related details like the countertops, cabinets, and other secondary elements can also be modified.

---

### Allowed Changes List:
- Adjust the background to better fit an e-commerce page or installation manual, such as replacing the kitchen setting with a neutral studio background.
- Modify the surrounding elements, like the countertops, cabinets, and additional decor, to complement the product display while retaining coherence.
- Shift the perspective to include front, left side, and top views of the refrigerators, possibly by adjusting camera angles or incorporating separate shots.

### Thinking process:
To determine the preservation targets, consider:
- **Core Recognition Elements:** The stainless steel finish, the double-door design, the water/ice dispenser placement, and the overall dimensions serve as key identifiers of the refrigerators.
- **Functional/Logical Association Elements:** The structural integrity and design features that define the refrigerator’s functionality must remain intact, ensuring users can understand its operation.
- **Visual Coherence Elements:** Minor details like the cabinet handles, window presence, and lighting should be retained to keep the scene consistent, unless they interfere with the intended product display.

### Preservation Targets List:
- The stainless steel finish and reflective surface texture.
- The double-door design with freezer doors including water/ice dispensers.
- The overall size and proportion of the refrigerators relative to each other.
- Placement of control panels and water/ice dispensers.
- The dark gray shaker-style cabinets above the refrigerators.
