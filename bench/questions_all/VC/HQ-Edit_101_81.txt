Description of reference image: The subject is a woman performing the Tree Pose (Vrksasana) in a brightly lit, minimalist yoga studio. She stands barefoot on a dark gray yoga mat placed centrally on light wooden flooring. Her right leg is bent with the foot pressed against the inner thigh of her left standing leg, and her arms are raised above her head in prayer position (Anjali Mudra), palms touching. She wears a light blue sleeveless athletic top and high-waisted, form-fitting gray leggings with subtle horizontal texturing near the waistband. Her hair is pulled back neatly, and her eyes are closed in a meditative expression. The room features two large vertical windows on the left wall, allowing strong natural sunlight to stream in, casting sharp diagonal shadows across the floor and walls. On the windowsill, small potted green plants are visible. To the right, there is a white couch with cushions, a small round wooden side table holding a plant, and a tall ladder-like shelf with dried botanicals. Hanging from the ceiling are three elongated white pendant lights. A framed artwork depicting a stylized bird hangs on the far wall. Two white candles are lit near the base of the left window. The overall atmosphere is serene, clean, and modern.

Thinking process:  
First, analyze the editing instructions word by word:  
- "Transform the yoga pose into an ancient Indian fresco" → implies artistic style change; the pose itself may be preserved but rendered in a different medium.  
- "Depicting the woman as an elegant dancer in traditional attire" → changes clothing type and style; original athletic wear must be replaced.  
- "Convert her clothing to vibrant, flowing fabrics adorned with intricate patterns" → confirms that clothing material, color, and design are allowed to change.  
- "Stylize the backdrop with mural-like designs featuring sacred symbols and motifs" → background environment must be transformed into a fresco-style setting with symbolic art.  
- "Maintaining the serene pose while integrating cultural artifacts like lamps and ornate decorations" → the **pose** is explicitly stated to be maintained, so the physical posture (Tree Pose) must remain unchanged.  
- "Evoking a spiritual ambiance" → suggests mood and aesthetic shift, but does not require retention of specific objects unless implied.

From this, we determine:
- **Allowed changes**: Clothing (type, color, texture), background (walls, furniture, lighting), artistic style (fresco rendering), decor (candles, plants, etc.), and overall atmosphere.
- **Not allowed to change**: The **pose** (specific body alignment in Tree Pose), **position** of the body relative to the mat, **barefoot stance**, **closed eyes**, **hands in Anjali Mudra**, and **orientation** (standing upright, facing forward). These are explicitly required to be retained via “maintaining the serene pose.”

Additionally, although the scene is to be transformed, certain **functional/logical elements** must be preserved due to their role in defining the action:
- The **yoga mat** must remain under the feet to support the balance pose — its presence is essential for grounding the action.
- The **single-leg balance** and **arm alignment** are core to the pose’s identity and cannot be altered without losing the pose’s essence.

Other elements such as the **window placement**, **light direction**, or **couch** are part of the original scene but are not required to be preserved since the instruction calls for a full transformation of the backdrop into a fresco.

Allowed Changes List:  
- Clothing (top and leggings)  
- Background scenery (walls, furniture, lighting fixtures)  
- Artistic style (modern photography → fresco painting)  
- Decorative elements (plants, candles, artwork)  
- Color scheme of entire scene  
- Texture and surface materials (wooden floor → possibly painted stone or mosaic)  

Step 2 - Determine the elements that should remain unchanged

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements:  
The **Tree Pose** is defined by specific biomechanical alignment: one leg grounded, the other lifted with foot placed on inner thigh, arms raised overhead in prayer. This is the **core identity** of the yoga posture. If this structure is altered (e.g., foot placed on calf instead of thigh, arms down), it ceases to be Tree Pose. Therefore, the **postural configuration** must be preserved.  

Functional/logical association elements:  
- The **yoga mat** is functional — it provides a stable surface for balance. Even if the scene becomes a fresco, the mat must still be present beneath her feet to maintain logical consistency with the act of practicing yoga. Its shape and position are key.  
- The **bare feet** are essential — wearing footwear would contradict the nature of the practice and the visual authenticity of the pose.  
- The **Anjali Mudra** (palms together above head) is a signature hand gesture of the pose; changing it would misrepresent the posture.  

Non-modified element deduction:  
Although the background is to be transformed, the **relative positioning** of the figure within the frame (centered, facing forward) and her **orientation** (upright, balanced) must remain consistent. Additionally, the **closed eyes** and **serene facial expression** reflect the meditative intent of the pose and contribute to the continuity of the subject’s state. While not strictly functional, they are integral to the **identity** of the moment being captured.

Preservation Targets List:  
- The Tree Pose posture: one leg grounded, other bent with foot on inner thigh, arms raised in prayer  
- The yoga mat beneath her feet  
- Bare feet in contact with the mat  
- Hands in Anjali Mudra (palms together above head)  
- Closed eyes and neutral facial expression  
- Upright, centered stance facing forward

    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The Tree Pose is uniquely defined by the alignment of the legs — specifically, the lifted foot resting on the inner thigh of the standing leg. This is the core biomechanical feature that distinguishes it from other balancing poses. Any deviation (e.g., foot on calf, knee bent differently) would alter the pose's identity. Thus, the precise placement of the foot on the inner thigh is a critical visual identifier and must be preserved.
    Question: Is the lifted foot placed on the inner thigh of the standing leg?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The hands forming Anjali Mudra (palms pressed together above the head) is a defining gesture of the Tree Pose. It is both a symbolic and structural component of the posture. Changing the hand position (e.g., arms down, open palms) would fundamentally alter the pose's identity and spiritual intent. Therefore, the specific hand configuration is a core recognition element.
    Question: Are the hands pressed together in prayer position directly above the head?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The yoga mat is a functional object necessary for the practice of yoga, especially in balance poses. Its presence under the feet provides stability and context. Removing it or replacing it with another surface would disrupt the logical coherence of the scene, even if the style is changed. The mat's shape and position are key to maintaining the realism of the practice.
    Question: Is the woman standing on a flat rectangular yoga mat?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The feet are bare, which is standard in yoga practice and essential for grip and balance. Wearing shoes or socks would contradict the nature of the pose and the intended representation. The visibility of the bare soles and toes is a minor but significant detail that reinforces authenticity.
    Question: Are the feet bare with no footwear?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The closed eyes and calm facial expression convey the meditative state associated with the pose. While not structurally vital, they are key to the emotional and spiritual identity of the image. Altering the eyes to be open or showing tension would misrepresent the intended serenity.
    Question: Are the eyes closed and the face relaxed?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The upright, centered stance with the body aligned vertically is essential for the balance and symmetry of the Tree Pose. Tilting the body or shifting weight would compromise the pose's integrity. This orientation is a foundational element of the posture’s visual identity.
    Question: Is the body upright and centered on the mat with no leaning?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The position of the arms — raised straight up with palms together — is a distinct feature of the pose. Any deviation in arm angle or separation would change the silhouette and meaning of the gesture. This alignment is crucial for correct identification of the pose.
    Question: Are the arms fully extended upward with elbows straight and palms touching?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
