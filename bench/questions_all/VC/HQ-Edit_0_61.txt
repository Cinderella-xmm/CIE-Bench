**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a traditional Japanese tea ceremony scene set within a tatami room, framed by an ornate dark wooden border. The central focus is a low wooden tea tray placed on the floor, holding two textured teapots with curved spouts and domed lids, three small ceramic tea cups filled with amber-colored tea, and a small dish with tea sweets. The tray rests on a woven tatami mat patterned with green borders and scattered autumn maple leaves in shades of red, orange, and yellow. A second smaller tray in the foreground contains one cup of tea. Behind the setup, a large shoji screen window composed of translucent paper panels divided into a grid by wooden frames reveals a soft-focus view of a forest in autumnal colors—reds, oranges, and yellows—bathed in golden morning light. On the right side, a potted maple tree with vibrant fall foliage extends into the frame, its branches partially overlapping the edge of the window. The overall lighting is warm and diffused, casting gentle shadows and enhancing the tranquil, seasonal atmosphere.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction specifies a transformation from a traditional tea scene to an **eco-friendly tea brand packaging concept**, which implies a reimagining of the entire composition as a product design. Key directives include:  
- "Redesign the traditional tea set scene" → the entire scene is being repurposed, not preserved.  
- "Frame the table as a tea box lid with engraved leaf patterns" → the central tray is to be transformed into a stylized box lid; this allows for modification of its form and surface texture.  
- "Replace the cups with sustainable material illustrations" → the physical cups are to be replaced entirely; their original form and material are no longer required.  
- "Add a tag with brand name 'Zen Autumn Tea' in elegant calligraphy" → new graphical element introduced; not present originally.  
- "Depict the teapot in a leaf-shaped contour with subtle earthy textures" → the teapot’s shape and texture are to be altered significantly.  

Thus, the following elements are explicitly allowed to change:  
- The **form and function** of the tea tray (now becomes a tea box lid).  
- The **physical appearance and material** of the tea cups (replaced with illustrations of sustainable materials).  
- The **shape and texture** of the teapot (transformed into a leaf-shaped silhouette with organic textures).  
- The **addition of new elements**: brand tag, calligraphy, engraved leaf patterns on the lid.  

However, the instruction does **not** mention altering or removing the **autumnal environment**, **shoji screen**, **tatami flooring**, **maple leaves**, or **overall color palette**. These are implied to remain part of the visual context, even if reinterpreted. Furthermore, since the transformation is into a *brand packaging concept*, the **original aesthetic tone**—warm, serene, autumnal—is likely to be preserved for thematic continuity.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
- The shape and surface details of the central tea tray (to become a tea box lid with engraved leaf patterns)  
- The form and material representation of the tea cups (to be replaced with sustainable material illustrations)  
- The shape and texture of the teapot (to be redesigned as a leaf-shaped contour with earthy textures)  
- Addition of a brand tag with "Zen Autumn Tea" in calligraphy  
- Introduction of illustrative elements representing sustainability

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
Core recognition elements must be identified based on what makes the original image uniquely identifiable as a **traditional Japanese tea ceremony scene in autumn**. These include:  
- The **shoji screen window** with its distinct grid pattern of wooden frames and translucent paper panels — this is a hallmark of traditional Japanese architecture and essential to the cultural identity of the scene.  
- The **tatami mat flooring** with its woven texture and green border lines — this defines the interior space and is inseparable from the authenticity of the setting.  
- The **scattered maple leaves** on the floor in vivid autumn hues — these are key indicators of seasonality and contribute to the thematic mood.  
- The **potted maple tree with bright fall foliage** on the right — this reinforces the seasonal context and adds depth to the composition.  
- The **soft, golden ambient lighting** filtering through the shoji screen — this creates the warm, meditative atmosphere central to the scene's emotional tone.  

Functional/logical association elements:  
- The **spatial relationship** between the tea tray and the shoji screen — the tray is positioned in front of the window, allowing the viewer to see both the ritual objects and the outdoor scenery. This layout supports the contemplative nature of tea ceremonies and should be preserved to maintain logical spatial coherence.  
- The **positioning of the maple leaves** on the floor — they appear naturally scattered, suggesting seasonal decay and natural flow. Altering their placement or removing them would disrupt the environmental narrative.  

Non-modified element deduction:  
While the teapot and cups may be redesigned, the **presence of tea-related objects** (even if abstracted) must still reflect their function. However, since the instruction allows full redesign of these items, only their **functional role** (tea-serving) is retained, not their original form.  

Therefore, the **scene structure** — including the shoji screen, tatami mats, maple foliage, and lighting — must remain intact to preserve the cultural and seasonal identity of the original image. These are not mentioned as changeable in the instructions and are foundational to the scene’s recognition.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
- The shoji screen window with its grid of wooden frames and translucent paper panels  
- The tatami mat flooring with visible woven texture and green border lines  
- The scattered maple leaves on the floor in autumnal colors (red, orange, yellow)  
- The potted maple tree with vibrant fall foliage extending into the frame  
- The soft golden lighting filtering through the shoji screen  
- The spatial layout of the tea tray in front of the window  
- The presence of natural autumnal elements in the background view outside the window
