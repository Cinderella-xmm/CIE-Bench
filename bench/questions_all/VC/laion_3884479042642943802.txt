Description of reference image: The subject is a female character with long, dark purple hair flowing behind her, styled in a sleek and slightly tousled manner. She has sharp, angular facial features, green eyes with a focused, intense gaze, and a stern expression. Her attire consists of a form-fitting, sleeveless dark blue top with a deep neckline, revealing part of her midriff. A gold circular pendant hangs from a thin black cord around her neck. She wears high-tech, segmented black armored boots that extend up to her thighs, laced with silver crisscross patterns on the outer side. Her right hand is raised, gripping two slender metallic claws (resembling throwing daggers or retractable blades), held in a ready-to-strike pose. Her left arm is extended forward, palm flat against the ground, supporting her crouched stance. The outfit includes a long, dark blue armored leg piece covering her left thigh and extending down to her knee, secured with gold-colored rings at the hip. The background is transparent, indicating no environmental context, and the lighting emphasizes shadows and highlights on her body and gear, suggesting a dynamic, action-oriented tone. The character’s posture is low and aggressive, conveying readiness for combat.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions word by word. The instruction specifies modifying the pose to "crouching on a rooftop ledge," which allows changing the current crouched position into one specifically placed on a rooftop edge—thus altering spatial positioning but not necessarily the character's physical form. The backdrop is to be changed to "a dimly lit city with spotlights and distant skyscrapers," meaning the environment is fully replaceable. The instruction says to "employ deep shades of blue and black for mood," which involves color grading and lighting changes—allowed modifications. Highlighting the claws with a "metallic glint" implies enhancement of material reflectivity, which is a visual effect modification allowed. Adding speech—"The night awaits..."—is a textual addition, not affecting original visual content directly. However, the core identity of the character must remain intact since she is the central figure in the narrative. Elements such as her clothing design, armor style, clawed weapon, facial features, and accessories are not mentioned for change, so they must be preserved. The instruction does not require changing her appearance, only repositioning and contextualizing her within a new scene. Therefore, any structural or stylistic element not explicitly altered in the instruction must be retained.

Allowed Changes List:
- Background environment (currently transparent) → replaced with dimly lit cityscape with skyscrapers and spotlights
- Lighting scheme → shifted to deep blues and blacks for mood
- Character’s pose → modified to crouch on a rooftop ledge (spatial orientation change)
- Claws → enhanced with metallic glint (material reflection adjustment)
- Textual overlay → added speech bubble with “The night awaits…”
- Overall composition → expanded to include city elements and perspective

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements: The character’s identity hinges on distinctive visual traits. These include her long dark purple hair, green eyes, facial structure, gold pendant, and signature armored attire—especially the segmented boots with silver lacing and the dual metallic claws. These are iconic identifiers; if altered, the character may no longer be recognizable. For example, changing the hair color or removing the pendant would disrupt recognition. The claws are functional tools tied to her role as a vigilante; their presence and form are essential to her identity.

Functional/logical association elements: The claws are not just decorative—they are weapons used in combat. Their retention ensures logical consistency with her role as a lone vigilante. If removed or transformed into non-functional objects, the narrative logic breaks. Similarly, her armored boots and leg pieces suggest mobility and protection, crucial for a rooftop operative. These must remain structurally consistent.

Non-modified element deduction: All elements not listed in the allowed changes list must be retained. This includes the texture of the armor, the specific shape of the boots, the gold ring fastenings, the pendant’s design, the hair length and flow, and the facial features. Even minor details like the silver lacing pattern on the boots contribute to visual coherence and should be preserved unless explicitly permitted to change.

Preservation Targets List:  
- Long dark purple hair with natural flow  
- Green eyes with sharp, focused expression  
- Gold circular pendant on black cord  
- Segmented armored boots with silver crisscross lacing  
- Dual metallic claws in right hand  
- Form-fitting dark blue top with deep neckline  
- Gold rings securing leg armor  
- Crouched posture with left hand on ground
