If it is changed or removed, the character loses its distinct identity. This is a key visual element that must be preserved regardless of stylistic changes like color enhancement or outlining. Therefore, it carries a weight of 3 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The basketball being held in the player’s right hand is essential to the action of dribbling. Its presence and location define the moment captured. Removing or relocating it would break the functional logic of the scene. Even if stylized, it must remain in the right hand near the waist. This is a critical functional element, so it receives a weight of 3 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The player’s mid-dribble pose—leaning forward with bent knees, arms in motion—is the defining action of the image. Altering this posture would misrepresent the intended dynamic. While the style may be comic-like, the pose must remain anatomically and narratively consistent. This is a key action element affecting overall coherence, thus weighted at 3 points.",

Their absence or significant distortion would remove environmental grounding. Even if stylized, the hoop must remain recognizable in shape and position.

These markings are functional and identifying features of a basketball court. Losing them would make the setting ambiguous. Though minor compared to the player, they are important for scene consistency and receive a weight of 2 points.",

While facial details may be simplified in a comic style, the basic features must remain recognizable. Changing them would risk misidentifying the subject.
