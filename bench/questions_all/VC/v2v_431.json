      "thinking_process": "The pentagram is the core identifying feature of the top-left key. It is a five-pointed star enclosed in a circle, with intersecting lines forming a symmetrical star shape. This is a unique and iconic symbol that defines the key’s identity. If this shape is lost or distorted beyond recognition (e.g., turned into a simple circle or star without internal lines), the key cannot be identified as the same object. Therefore, preserving the **presence and structure of the pentagram** is critical for identity retention. This is a 3-point element because it is a primary identifier of the key.",
      "question": "Is the pentagram symbol (five-pointed star within a circular frame) present and structurally intact in the top-left key's head?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The Eye of Horus is a highly specific and culturally significant symbol. Its defining features include a stylized human eye with a curved upper lid, a prominent eyebrow, a teardrop-shaped extension below, and a line extending from the outer corner. This exact configuration is necessary to identify the symbol. Any simplification or abstraction that removes these components would destroy its identity. Since the instruction requires preserving \"distinctive designs,\" this symbol must retain its core visual structure.",
      "question": "Is the Eye of Horus symbol (with eye, eyebrow, teardrop, and side line) clearly depicted in the top-right key's head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The Latin cross is a fundamental religious symbol with a vertical stem and a shorter horizontal bar near the top. This specific proportion and alignment distinguish it from other crosses (e.g., Greek or Celtic). In the context of the key, this cross is the defining feature of the bottom-center key. Altering its shape or proportions would misrepresent the key’s identity. As a core symbolic element, it must be preserved.",
      "question": "Is the Latin cross (vertical bar with a shorter horizontal bar near the top) present in the center of the bottom-center key's head?",

      "thinking_process": "The Celtic knot is a continuous, interlaced pattern forming a square. It is characterized by flowing lines that weave over and under each other without beginning or end. This specific topology is essential to its identity. If the knot is simplified into a plain square or broken into separate lines, it loses its meaning and recognition. Since the instruction mandates preservation of \"distinctive designs,\" this complex pattern must remain intact.",
      "question": "Is the Celtic knot pattern (interlacing continuous lines forming a square) present in the bottom-right key's head?",

      "thinking_process": "The triangular geometric pattern in the top-center key is a symmetrical abstract design resembling a trident or triquetra. It consists of three interconnected arches forming a triangle. This is a unique shape not found in the other keys. Its preservation is necessary to distinguish this key from others. Even in a chibi style, the **basic triangular outline and internal symmetry** must be maintained.",
      "question": "Is the triangular head with a symmetrical internal geometric pattern (three arches forming a trident-like shape) present in the top-center key?",

      "thinking_process": "The floral scrollwork in the bottom-left key is a curvilinear, symmetrical design with looping tendrils and swirls. This organic, decorative pattern is distinct from the other keys’ more geometric or symbolic designs. It serves as a key identifier for this particular key. While the style may change, the **presence of the swirling, symmetrical scroll pattern** must be preserved.",
      "question": "Is the floral scrollwork (symmetrical curvilinear design with looping tendrils) present in the bottom-left key's head?",

      "thinking_process": "The bit end (the notched, toothed part at the bottom of each key) is a functional component that defines the object as a key. Even in a cartoon style, the **presence of a notched or toothed section** at the end of the shaft is essential for maintaining the object’s identity. Without it, the object becomes unrecognizable as a key. This is a functional/logical element that must be preserved.",
      "question": "Does each key have a notched or toothed bit end at the bottom of its shaft?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The arrangement of the keys in a 2x3 grid is a spatial organization that contributes to the composition and identification of the scene. Changing the layout (e.g., rearranging or removing keys) would alter the visual narrative. Since the instruction does not mention changing the number or arrangement, and since the keys are presented as a set, the **number (six) and grid layout** must be preserved.",
      "question": "Are there exactly six keys arranged in two rows of three on the surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The orientation of each key (shaft pointing downward) is consistent across all keys and contributes to the visual coherence of the image. Reversing or tilting any key would disrupt the uniformity and intended presentation. Although not a core identity feature, this alignment is important for maintaining the original composition and should be preserved.",
      "question": "Are all six keys oriented with their shafts pointing downward?",
