Description of reference image: The subject is a stylized, flat-line illustration of an open book centered on a light beige background. The book is depicted in a symmetrical, minimalist design with dark navy blue outlines and no internal shading or texture. The cover of the book is represented by two vertical rectangular shapes on either side of the spine, which is a small horizontal oval at the bottom center. The pages are shown as multiple curved horizontal lines on both left and right sides, suggesting stacked paper layers. Above the book, the text "STORY PAGES" is displayed in bold, uppercase serif font, also in dark navy blue. The letters are evenly spaced and aligned centrally above the book. The overall composition is clean, balanced, and graphic in style, with no gradients, shadows, or additional decorative elements.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions that explicitly transform the form of the original subject — the book illustration — into a snow globe scene. This indicates that the **form** of the book (its physical representation) can be changed, but only within the context of being reimagined as a chibi-style 3D object inside a snow globe. The instruction specifies that the book must remain recognizable as a book, even in its transformed state, and that it should be open with fluttering magical pages. Therefore, while the **visual form** of the book may change from 2D line art to 3D chibi design, its **core identity as a book** must be preserved. The surrounding environment is entirely new — a shelf, other books, a library backdrop, a lamp — so these are allowed changes. However, the instruction does not mention altering the **text "STORY PAGES"**, nor does it suggest removing or changing the **original book’s structural features** such as the open pages, spine, or cover shape. Since the text is part of the original image and not mentioned for modification, it must be retained unless explicitly stated otherwise. The instruction focuses on transforming the **book illustration**, not the entire composition, so the **textual element** remains unchanged.

Allowed Changes List:
- The form of the book illustration (from 2D line art to 3D chibi-style object)
- The spatial context (from isolated on plain background to inside a snow globe on a shelf)
- The background (from plain beige to blurred cozy library with warm tones)
- The lighting (from neutral to soft golden glow from a nearby lamp)
- The addition of snow and sparkles inside the globe
- The transformation of the book into a compact, animated, magical version with fluttering pages

Step 2- Determine the elements that should remain unchanged  
Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements: The original image's central subject is a stylized open book with distinct visual characteristics: the symmetrical layout, the curved page lines, the visible spine, and the open cover structure. These are essential to identifying the object as a book. Even though the book will be transformed into a chibi-style 3D model inside a snow globe, its **identity as a book** must be preserved. The **openness** of the book and the **presence of pages** are core to its function and recognition. The **spine** and **cover edges** are structural identifiers that distinguish it from other objects like scrolls or boxes. These must be retained in some form in the edited version.

Functional/logical association elements: The book is the central subject of the image and is directly associated with the text "STORY PAGES". The text is positioned above the book and serves as a label or title. There is a logical relationship between the text and the book — they together form a coherent message about storytelling. Since the instruction does not mention modifying the text, and since it is a key part of the original image’s identity, it must be preserved. Removing or altering it would break the semantic coherence of the image.

Non modified element deduction: After excluding the allowed changes (the book’s form, background, lighting, etc.), the remaining unmentioned elements include the **text "STORY PAGES"**, the **specific arrangement of the book’s pages**, the **symmetry of the design**, and the **color scheme** (dark navy blue on beige). While the color might be altered slightly due to lighting effects in the snow globe, the **original color contrast** and **typographic style** should be preserved unless explicitly changed. The **position of the text relative to the book** is also important for maintaining the original composition’s balance and meaning.

Preservation Targets List:  
- The presence of the text "STORY PAGES" in uppercase serif font  
- The open book structure with visible spine and cover edges  
- The curved page lines indicating stacked pages  
- The symmetrical layout of the book and text  
- The dark navy blue color of the book and text against the light beige background  

Q1:  
Thinking process: The text "STORY PAGES" is a core identification feature of the original image. It is not mentioned in the editing instructions as something to be removed or altered, and it functions as a direct label for the book illustration. Its presence is essential for maintaining the original message and identity of the image. If this text were missing or changed, the image would lose its primary communicative purpose. Therefore, it is a key element with a weight of 3 points.  
Question: Is the text "STORY PAGES" present in uppercase serif font above the book?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The open book structure, including the visible spine and cover edges, is a core recognition feature. The book is clearly depicted as open, with two covers and a central spine. This structural detail is essential for identifying the object as a book. Even if transformed into a 3D chibi model, the open form must be preserved to maintain the book’s identity. Losing this would make the object unrecognizable as a book. Thus, it is a core element with a weight of 3 points.  
Question: Does the book have a visible spine and two cover edges forming an open structure?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The curved page lines are a distinctive visual feature of the book illustration. They represent the stacked pages and are essential for conveying the idea of a book with content. These lines are consistent across both sides of the book and contribute to the symmetry and readability of the design. Even in a 3D chibi version, the presence of multiple curved lines indicating pages must be retained to preserve the book’s identity. This is a key functional detail with a weight of 2 points.  
Question: Are there multiple curved horizontal lines on both left and right sides of the book representing stacked pages?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The symmetrical layout of the book and text is a critical compositional element. The book is centered, and the text is aligned directly above it, creating a balanced and harmonious design. This symmetry contributes to the image’s clarity and aesthetic appeal. While the new scene may introduce asymmetry (e.g., a lamp on one side), the original symmetry between the book and text must be preserved to maintain the original visual logic. This is an important structural element with a weight of 2 points.  
Question: Is the book centered horizontally and vertically beneath the text "STORY PAGES"?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The color scheme of dark navy blue for the book and text against a light beige background is a defining visual characteristic. This contrast ensures legibility and contributes to the image’s clean, minimalist style. Although lighting effects in the snow globe may alter perceived colors, the original color pairing must be preserved to maintain visual consistency. Changing the color could disrupt the image’s identity. This is a secondary but important detail with a weight of 1 point.  
Question: Is the book and text rendered in dark navy blue on a light beige background?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1
