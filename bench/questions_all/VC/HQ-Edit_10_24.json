      "thinking_process": "The key identification feature of the subject is her facial expression—specifically, the open mouth with visible red lips and flushed cheeks, which captures the moment of blowing bubbles. This is critical for recognizing the action and emotional state. If this expression is altered (e.g., closed mouth, neutral face), the narrative of bubble-blowing is lost. It is a core identity feature tied directly to the scene’s intent. Therefore, it must be preserved.",
      "question": "Is the girl’s mouth visibly open with red lips and rosy cheeks, indicating she is blowing bubbles?",

      "thinking_process": "The presence of the pink bubble wand in her right hand is a functional object directly tied to the action. Its shape and position are essential for understanding how the bubbles (or lanterns) originate. Even if transformed into a magical item, the wand must remain in the same hand and orientation. Removing or altering its position would break the logical cause-effect relationship.",
      "question": "Is the pink bubble wand held in the girl’s right hand, with its loop facing outward?",

      "thinking_process": "The yellow bottle of bubble solution is a key accessory that supports the functionality of the scene. It is held in the left hand and provides context for the source of the bubbles. Its color and cylindrical shape are distinctive and must remain identifiable even if stylized. Losing it would make the action unexplained.",

      "thinking_process": "The long, wavy black hair with bangs is a defining physical trait of the subject. While silver strands may be added, the base hair color and structure must remain unchanged. Altering the length, wave pattern, or bangs would fundamentally change the character’s appearance and identity.",

      "thinking_process": "The off-the-shoulder silhouette of the dress is a structural detail that defines the outfit’s style. Even if transformed into flowing petals, the dress must maintain the same shoulder exposure and sleeve width. Changing this would misrepresent the original attire’s form.",
