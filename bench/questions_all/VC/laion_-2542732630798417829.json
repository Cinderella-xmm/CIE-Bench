      "thinking_process": "The teardrop-shaped glass bulb with visible internal filament structure is the core identity feature of the original light fixture. This shape and internal wiring pattern are unique to Edison-style bulbs and distinguish them from other types. If the bulb were replaced with a spherical or flat shape, or if the filaments were omitted, the character would no longer resemble the original object. Thus, preserving the teardrop form and filament visibility is essential for identity recognition.",
      "question": "Is the glass bulb shaped like a teardrop with visible internal filaments present?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The black metal cage with curved vertical bars is a defining structural element of the fixture. Its open, cage-like design is both functional and stylistic, and removing or altering its shape (e.g., making it solid or rectangular) would fundamentally change the appearance of the object. Since the character is \"based on\" the original image, the cage must retain its distinctive curved bar pattern to ensure visual continuity.",
      "question": "Are the curved vertical bars forming a cage-like structure around the bulb present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The top cylindrical housing connects the bulb to the cord and contains a visible screw detail, which is a key identifying feature of the industrial design. This component anchors the fixture and contributes to its authenticity. If replaced with a different shape or missing entirely, the mechanical integrity of the original object would be lost. Its presence ensures the character retains a realistic base.",
      "question": "Is the dark cylindrical housing at the top of the fixture with a visible screw detail present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The circular base cap at the bottom of the cage secures the structure and completes the symmetrical design. It is a functional and visual endpoint of the cage. Removing or replacing it with another shape would disrupt the balance and coherence of the original design. While it may be stylized in the comic, its basic form must remain intact.",
      "question": "Is the circular cap at the bottom of the metal cage present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The relative positioning of the bulb within the cage is critical to maintaining the functional relationship between components. The bulb must remain centered and enclosed by the cage, as this reflects the original fixtureâ€™s design. If the bulb were outside or misaligned, the logical structure of the object would be broken, undermining its identity.",
      "question": "Is the glass bulb positioned centrally within the metal cage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
