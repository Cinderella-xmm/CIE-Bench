Description of reference image: The subject is an ornate, metallic teapot placed on a wooden table near a window with visible panes. The teapot has a highly reflective, polished surface with intricate embossed patterns covering its body, lid, spout, and handle. The design features elaborate floral and scroll motifs in a symmetrical layout across the rounded body, with raised ridges and deep engraving creating contrast between light and shadow. The spout curves upward and outward with a sharp, pointed tip. The handle is sculpted into a decorative, baroque-style loop with leaf-like embellishments. The lid is domed with a finial at the top resembling a stylized acorn or knob, also detailed with fine ornamentation. The base of the teapot is flared and circular, featuring a textured band with repeating geometric or floral designs. The material appears to be silver or pewter, with warm golden reflections suggesting ambient lighting from the left side (likely sunlight through the window). The background includes a softly lit window with a grid pattern, casting diagonal shadows on the wooden floor, which has visible grain and plank lines. The overall atmosphere is calm and elegant, emphasizing craftsmanship and stillness.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions to determine what can be changed. The instruction states: "Miniaturize the ornate teapot into a decorative 3D display within a glass dome." This implies the **form and scale** of the teapot can change — it becomes smaller and enclosed. However, the **identity** of the teapot must remain intact; thus, its **design features** are not to be altered unless specified.  
"Position the teapot atop a mirrored base with small porcelain cups encircling it" — this changes the **placement**, **supporting structure**, and **surrounding objects**, so the **base** and **context** are allowed to change.  
"Add tiny, detailed engravings on an elevation, amplifying its intricate patterns" — this allows for **enhancement** of existing patterns, but only if they align with the original style. Since the original already has complex engravings, new ones must **match the style**, not replace them.  
"Surround the scene with faux steam spirals winding upwards" — this adds **non-physical elements**, so **steam** is allowed as a new addition, not part of original content.  

Thus, **allowed changes** include:
- Scaling down the teapot
- Encasing it in a glass dome
- Replacing the wooden table with a mirrored base
- Adding surrounding porcelain cups
- Enhancing engravings (as long as consistent with original style)
- Adding artificial steam effects

Allowed Changes List:
- Size and scale of the teapot (miniaturized)
- Presence of glass dome enclosure
- Base material (mirrored instead of wooden)
- Addition of porcelain cups around the teapot
- Addition of steam spirals
- Enhancement of engraved details (if stylistically consistent)

Step 2 - Determine the elements that should remain unchanged

Thinking process:
Core recognition elements: The **teapot’s form**, **surface texture**, **engraved patterns**, **spout shape**, **handle design**, and **lid finial** are essential to identifying it as the same object. These are not just aesthetic but structural identifiers. Even when miniaturized, these must retain their **original shapes and relative proportions**. For example, changing the spout to a straight tube would destroy identity. Similarly, altering the floral motif style would make it unrecognizable as the original piece. Thus, the **iconic visual features** must be preserved.

Functional/logical association elements: The teapot functions as a vessel for liquid, and its **spout**, **lid**, and **handle** are functional parts. Even in a decorative display, their **functional forms** must be preserved to maintain logical coherence — a teapot without a spout is not a teapot. Hence, **spout presence**, **lid closure**, and **handle attachment** must remain.

Non-modified element deduction: Elements not mentioned in the allowed changes list — such as **the specific floral scroll patterns**, **the raised ridges**, **the finial shape**, **the base's textured band**, and **the reflective quality of the metal** — must be retained because they are **not permitted to be replaced or altered** by the instructions. Although the scene changes, the **visual identity** of the teapot itself must stay true.

Preservation Targets List:
- The curved spout with pointed tip
- The ornate, baroque-style handle with leaf-like flourishes
- The domed lid with finial at the top
- The intricate floral and scroll engravings across the body
- The flared base with textured band
- The reflective metallic surface with warm golden highlights
- The symmetrical arrangement of patterns
- The overall rounded, bulbous form of the body

    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The curved spout with a pointed tip is a key structural feature of the teapot, distinguishing it from other vessels. Its shape is unique and essential for identification. If replaced with a straight or blunt spout, the object would no longer resemble the original. Therefore, preserving the exact curvature and pointed end is critical for maintaining identity.
    Question: Does the teapot retain the original curved spout with a sharply pointed tip?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The ornate handle with leaf-like flourishes is a defining characteristic of the teapot's decorative style. It contributes significantly to the baroque aesthetic and is structurally distinct. Altering its shape or removing the flourishes would compromise the visual integrity of the original design.
    Question: Is the handle shaped with elaborate leaf-like embellishments and a looping baroque form?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

}

{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The domed lid with a finial at the top is a core component of the teapot’s silhouette. The finial’s shape — resembling a stylized acorn or knob — is a signature detail. Removing or simplifying it would make the object visually incomplete and unrecognizable as the original.
    Question: Does the lid feature a domed shape with a finial at the apex that matches the original stylized knob form?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The intricate floral and scroll engravings cover the body and are central to the teapot’s artistic identity. These patterns are not random but follow a symmetrical, ornamental design. Any deviation in motif or placement would break the visual consistency and reduce authenticity.
    Question: Are the floral and scroll engravings present across the body in their original symmetrical and raised configuration?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The flared base with a textured band is a distinctive structural element that anchors the teapot’s design. Its presence and pattern contribute to the balance and completeness of the object. Changing or omitting this base would disrupt the overall proportion and visual harmony.
    Question: Does the teapot rest on a flared base with a clearly defined textured band matching the original design?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The reflective metallic surface with warm golden highlights indicates the material and lighting interaction. While the lighting may shift due to the glass dome, the inherent reflectivity and color tone (silver/pewter with golden reflections) must be preserved to maintain the original material appearance.
    Question: Is the teapot's surface still reflective with visible golden highlights consistent with the original metallic sheen?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The overall rounded, bulbous form of the body is a fundamental shape that defines the teapot’s silhouette. Altering this into a cylindrical or angular form would fundamentally change the object’s identity. Even in miniature, this form must remain.
    Question: Does the body of the teapot maintain its original rounded, bulbous shape?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
