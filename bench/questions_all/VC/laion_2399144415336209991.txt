**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a bride and groom in a close, affectionate pose. The bride has blonde hair styled in an elegant updo with a delicate pearl headband. She wears a white wedding gown with intricate beadwork forming geometric patterns on the shoulders and upper arms, resembling cascading strands of pearls. Her attire includes a pearl necklace and matching earrings. Her expression is joyful, with a wide smile and bright eyes. The groom stands slightly behind her, wearing a navy blue suit with a white shirt, a maroon bow tie, and a white floral boutonniere pinned to his left lapel. His facial features include short brown hair, light stubble, and a warm smile. The couple is positioned against a plain, softly lit off-white background with architectural elements such as a column and partial roofline visible. The lighting is natural and soft, suggesting outdoor daylight. The composition emphasizes intimacy and elegance.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instructions specify:  
- **Cartoonize the couple**: This implies altering the visual style (e.g., line art, exaggerated proportions), but does not necessarily alter core identity elements unless explicitly stated. However, "cartoonize" suggests transformation in form, so realistic textures and proportions may be changed.  
- **Exaggerated attire details**: Specifically mentions enhancing the beadwork on the gown and enlarging the lapel of the suit. These are direct modifications to clothing elements—allowed changes.  
- **Add action presets**: Holding hands, toasting, dancing—these imply new poses and actions not present in the original. Therefore, posture and interaction can change.  
- **Frame each in a gold-trimmed, heart-shaped border on a cream envelope with floral engravings**: This introduces a completely new scene element—the frame and envelope—so the original background and spatial context are not required to be preserved.  

Thus, the following elements are **allowed to change**:
- The **style** of the image (realistic → cartoonized)
- The **proportions and details** of the attire (beadwork enhanced, lapel enlarged)
- The **posture and actions** of the couple (new poses added)
- The **background and framing** (replaced with a decorative envelope and heart-shaped border)

**Allowed Changes List:**
- Cartoonization of the couple's appearance
- Exaggeration of beadwork on the bride’s dress
- Enlargement of the groom’s suit lapel
- Addition of new poses (holding hands, toasting, dancing)
- Replacement of background with a cream envelope featuring a gold-trimmed heart-shaped border and floral engravings

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
Now, we exclude the allowed changes and identify what must remain based on:

1. **Core recognition elements**: These are essential for identifying the subjects as the specific individuals in this photograph. Even if stylized, their unique physical traits should be recognizable. For example:
   - The bride’s blonde hair color and updo style
   - The groom’s facial structure, including jawline, eye shape, and hairstyle
   - The specific design of the wedding gown’s shoulder beadwork (even if exaggerated, its pattern must be traceable)
   - The groom’s boutonniere placement and flower type (white rose with green leaves)

2. **Functional/logical association elements**: These maintain logical coherence. For instance:
   - The bride’s hand resting on the groom’s arm—this gesture is part of the original emotional connection and should be preserved in at least one version of the series.
   - The relative positioning of the couple (bride leaning into groom) is central to the intimacy depicted.

3. **Non-modified element deduction**: After excluding allowed changes, any unmentioned visual detail that contributes to identity or authenticity must be retained. Examples:
   - The presence of the pearl headband
   - The exact location of the boutonniere (left lapel)
   - The color of the groom’s suit (navy blue)
   - The bride’s necklace and earrings (pearl-based)

Even though the image will be cartoonized and framed differently, these core visual identifiers must survive the transformation to preserve the original identity of the couple.

**Preservation Targets List:**
- Bride’s blonde hair in an updo with a pearl headband
- Groom’s short brown hair and facial stubble
- Bride’s white wedding dress with distinctive beaded shoulder design
- Groom’s navy blue suit with maroon bow tie and white floral boutonniere on the left lapel
- The couple’s facial expressions (joyful smiles)
- The position of the bride’s hand on the groom’s arm
- The presence of pearl jewelry (necklace, earrings, bracelet)
- The overall gender and age appearance of the couple

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

Q1:  
Thinking process: The bride’s blonde hair styled in an updo with a pearl headband is a core recognition feature. This combination uniquely identifies her in the image. If the hair color, style, or headband are altered beyond recognition, the subject would no longer be identifiable as the original bride. The pearl headband is particularly distinctive due to its placement and reflective texture. This is a key identity element, so it must be preserved even in cartoon form.  
Question: Is the bride’s hair blonde and styled in an updo with a pearl headband visible?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The groom’s facial features—specifically his short brown hair, light stubble, and distinct jawline—are critical for identification. These traits are consistent across all versions of the image and must remain intact in any stylized rendering. Altering them would make him unrecognizable.  
Question: Does the groom have short brown hair and light facial stubble?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The bride’s dress features a unique beaded pattern on the shoulders, forming curved lines of pearls. This is a signature design element that distinguishes her attire from generic wedding gowns. Even if exaggerated, the pattern must be derived from this original structure. Losing it would compromise the authenticity of the garment.  
Question: Are there multiple strands of beads forming a web-like pattern on the bride’s shoulders?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The groom’s boutonniere is a white flower with green leaves, pinned to the left lapel. Its placement and appearance are specific and serve as a key accessory identifier. Changing its color, type, or location would misrepresent the original outfit.  
Question: Is there a white flower with green leaves pinned to the groom’s left lapel?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The bride’s pearl jewelry—including the necklace, earrings, and bracelet—is a recurring detail that enhances her bridal look. The bracelet on her wrist matches the design of the shoulder beads, creating visual continuity. This set of accessories is integral to her appearance and must be retained in some form.  
Question: Does the bride wear a pearl necklace, pearl earrings, and a multi-strand pearl bracelet on her right wrist?

A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:

Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q7:

Question: Is the bride’s right hand placed on the groom’s left arm?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q8:
