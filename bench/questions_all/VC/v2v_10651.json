      "thinking_process": "The diamond-cut pattern on the decanter is a defining visual characteristic that distinguishes it from plain glassware. It is a core identity feature because its geometric precision and repetition are unique to this type of decanter. Even in a claymation style, the pattern must be represented in some form (e.g., embossed or molded) to maintain recognition. Losing this pattern would make the object unidentifiable as the original decanter, hence it is a 3-point element.",
      "question": "Is the diamond-cut pattern on the decanter preserved in the edited image?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The foam head on the glass is a key identifier of the beverage as a carbonated or fermented drink like beer. Its presence is essential for understanding the content of the glass. In a claymation version, the foam must still appear as a distinct, lighter-colored layer at the top of the liquid. Removing or altering it would misrepresent the drink, making it a 3-point element.",
      "question": "Is the white foam layer present on top of the liquid in the glass?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The fireplace with active flames is explicitly required to be preserved. The flames themselves are a dynamic element that contributes to the warm, inviting atmosphere. Their presence, movement, and glow are central to the scene’s mood. Any loss of flame detail would violate the instruction and destroy the intended ambiance, making this a 3-point element.",
      "question": "Are visible flames and glowing embers present in the fireplace in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The brass bottle opener has a distinct shape and function. Its silhouette—especially the D-shaped opening and elongated handle—is crucial for identification. Even if made of clay, the form must remain recognizable. Altering its shape would break the functional logic of the scene, so it is a 2-point element.",
      "question": "Is the bottle opener shaped with a D-shaped opening and a long handle, matching its original form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The relative positioning of the objects—the decanter on the right, glass on the left, opener in front—is essential for scene coherence. This layout implies a serving setup and maintains spatial logic. Changing positions would disrupt the narrative and visual balance, making it a 2-point element.",
      "question": "Is the decanter positioned to the right of the glass, with the opener placed in front of both?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The wooden table surface with visible grain provides grounding and context. While the texture may be stylized in claymation, the wood grain pattern must remain visible to preserve the material identity of the surface. Losing this would make the table appear unnatural or inconsistent with the original, making it a 1-point element.",
      "question": "Is the wooden table surface with visible grain texture present beneath the objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The liquid level in both the glass and decanter indicates fullness and consistency. The glass is nearly full, and the decanter is about half-full. These levels are important for realism and continuity. Changing them would alter the perceived state of the drink, making it a 1-point element.",
      "question": "Is the liquid level in the glass approximately near the rim, and in the decanter about halfway up?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q8",
      "thinking_process": "The brickwork around the fireplace is part of the preserved background. Its texture and structure contribute to the authenticity of the setting. Even in a stylized version, the brick pattern must remain identifiable to maintain the scene’s architectural integrity, making it a 1-point element.",
      "question": "Is the brick pattern surrounding the fireplace visible and intact in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
