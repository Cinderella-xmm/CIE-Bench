Description of reference image: The subject is a collection of interlocking plastic building blocks, predominantly red in color, with one distinct green block positioned centrally among them. The blocks are rectangular prisms with circular studs on the top surface arranged in a grid pattern (typically 2x4 or 2x2), and hollow recesses on the underside for connection. The red blocks vary slightly in size and orientation, creating a dense, layered pile that fills the entire frame. The central green block is a standard 2x4 brick, oriented horizontally, and stands out due to its contrasting color. All blocks exhibit a smooth, matte plastic texture with subtle highlights indicating a uniform light source from above. The composition emphasizes the contrast between the singular green block and the surrounding sea of red, highlighting its uniqueness through color and placement.

Thinking process: First, analyze the instructions that clearly state what can be changed: "Convert the central green block into a 3D chibi-style cartoon character" — this means the form, shape, and identity of the central green block are allowed to change entirely. "Redesign the red blocks as lively supporting characters" — this indicates the red blocks may also be transformed into animated figures, so their original form is not required to remain. "Transform the environment into a romantic proposal scene" — this confirms the background and overall setting are fully replaceable. "Sprinkle heart-shaped confetti" — this is an added element, not part of the original. However, the instruction does not mention changing the number, arrangement, or relative positioning of the blocks as a whole, nor does it specify altering the core visual identity of the blocks themselves beyond transformation into characters. Therefore, while the physical forms of the blocks are permitted to change, the underlying structural logic — such as the presence of a single contrasting block in the center — may still need to be preserved if it's a key compositional feature.

Allowed Changes List:
- The central green block’s form and identity (can be converted into a chibi character)
- The red blocks’ form and identity (can be redesigned as supporting characters)
- The background environment (can be transformed into a romantic proposal scene)
- The addition of heart-shaped confetti
- The overall lighting and color palette (can shift to soft pastel tones)
- The texture and material appearance of the blocks (can be stylized to match cartoon aesthetic)

Step 2- Determine the elements that should remain unchanged

Thinking process:
Core recognition elements: The original image features a distinctive visual configuration — a single green block surrounded by red ones. This contrast is not just about color but about spatial isolation and symbolic uniqueness. While the blocks themselves can be reimagined as characters, the **presence of a single contrasting block at the center** is a core compositional and symbolic feature. It is the defining characteristic of the image’s narrative — “the odd one out.” Even if transformed, the *position* and *role* of this central block must be preserved to maintain the original concept. Additionally, the **grid-like stud pattern** on the top of each block is a signature design of LEGO bricks and is essential for identifying them as such. If these studs are removed or altered beyond recognition, the blocks lose their identity as building bricks.

Functional/logical association elements: The relationship between the central green block and the surrounding red blocks is functional in terms of visual hierarchy and narrative meaning. The green block is isolated and highlighted, suggesting importance or difference. This spatial and symbolic relationship must be preserved even if the forms are changed — i.e., the chibi character derived from the green block should still be centrally located and visually distinct from the others.

Non modified element deduction: After excluding the allowed changes (form, color, texture, background), the remaining unmentioned but visually present elements include:
- The **number of blocks**: though they can be stylized, the general density and quantity suggest a large pile.
- The **relative position of the green block**: it must remain central.
- The **presence of studs**: these are iconic and define the object type.
- The **rectangular prism shape** of the blocks: even if stylized, the basic geometry should be recognizable.

Preservation Targets List:
- The central position of the contrasting block (green in original)
- The presence of stud patterns on the top surface of all blocks
- The rectangular prism shape of the blocks
- The overall pile-like arrangement of blocks filling the frame
- The existence of a single block differing in color from the rest

Q1:  
Thinking process: The central green block is the focal point of the image, defined by its unique color and central location. Its position is critical to the image’s narrative and visual balance. Even after transformation into a chibi character, the character must occupy the same central position to preserve the original composition’s intent. This spatial relationship is a core identity feature — losing it would fundamentally alter the image’s message and structure. Therefore, the question directly targets the preservation of this key positional element, which is essential for maintaining consistency with the original.

Question: Is the central character (derived from the green block) positioned exactly in the middle of the composition, surrounded by other characters?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The stud pattern on the top of each block is a defining visual feature of LEGO bricks. It is the primary identifier that distinguishes these objects from generic cubes or other toys. Even if the blocks are stylized into cartoon characters, the presence of the stud pattern — whether as a simplified design or integrated into the character’s body — must be retained to preserve the object’s identity. Without it, the characters lose their connection to the original building blocks, breaking the visual continuity.

Question: Do the characters derived from the blocks retain the circular stud pattern on their upper surfaces?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The rectangular prism shape is fundamental to the identity of LEGO bricks. While the instruction allows for transformation into chibi characters, the base geometry must remain recognizable. A chibi character derived from a block should still have a boxy, cubic form consistent with the original block’s silhouette. If the shape becomes rounded or organic, it no longer represents a block, undermining the transformation’s coherence.

Question: Are the characters derived from the blocks primarily composed of rectangular or boxy shapes, preserving the original block geometry?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The pile-like arrangement of blocks filling the frame creates a sense of abundance and context. This dense, overlapping layout is a key environmental detail that defines the scene. Even if the background is changed, the foreground must still show a cluster of characters (originally blocks) densely packed together, maintaining the impression of a heap. This spatial density is important for visual coherence and continuity.

Question: Is the composition filled with a dense cluster of characters (originally blocks), arranged in a piled, overlapping manner?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The original image features a single block of different color (green) among many red ones. This contrast is central to the image’s meaning. Even after transformation, the derived character from the green block must remain visually distinct in color or design from the others to preserve the “odd one out” theme. If all characters become uniformly colored or styled, the original contrast is lost.

Question: Is there only one character (derived from the green block) that differs in color or design from the surrounding characters?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The underside of the blocks has hollow recesses designed for interlocking. While not visible in the original image due to the angle, the presence of these features is implied by the nature of the objects. In a faithful edit, even if stylized, the characters should retain some indication of connectivity — such as small indentations or mechanical joints — to reflect the original function. This is a minor but meaningful detail that supports the authenticity of the transformation.

Question: Do the characters derived from the blocks retain any visual indication of interlocking mechanisms (such as recessed areas or connectors)?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
