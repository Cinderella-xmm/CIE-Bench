Description of reference image: The subject consists of two forms of the same toy model: a sleek, low-profile sports car and its transformed robot形态. The car is predominantly black with vibrant red accents along the sides, front bumper, and rear wing, featuring silver wheels with five-spoke rims. The front grille displays a distinctive horseshoe-shaped emblem with a central mesh pattern, characteristic of high-end luxury sports cars. The robot form stands upright, with arms formed from the car's doors and fenders, legs derived from the chassis and wheels, and a head section resembling the car’s cockpit. The robot retains the red-and-black color scheme, with gold-colored armor plating on the chest, segmented like a mechanical torso. The transformation mechanism appears articulated, with visible joints and structural components that suggest articulation. The background is a clean, white studio environment with soft lighting and subtle reflections beneath both figures, emphasizing their glossy plastic surfaces. The overall composition places the car in the foreground, slightly angled to show profile details, while the robot stands behind it, towering over the vehicle.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions for explicit changes:  
- "Transform the toy car and robot into a dynamic collectible packaging" → This implies changing the scene and context entirely; the original display setting can be altered.  
- "Design the box in an isometric perspective, labeled 'DUAL TRANSFORMER HEROES'" → The packaging design is new, so the background and presentation are allowed to change.  
- "Feature a chibi-style version of both figures" → The style of the figures inside the box will be stylized (chibi), so the proportions and facial features may differ.  
- "Include accessories: mini tool set, interchangeable helmets, and a gear base" → These are additions not present in the original image, so they are permitted.  
- "Display the figures outside, detailed with realistic textures for a lifelike appearance in a polished showcase" → This suggests that the exterior figures may be re-rendered with enhanced textures but must still represent the same core identity.  

Allowed Changes List:  
- Background environment (studio white → collectible box)  
- Presentation format (isolated toys → packaged product)  
- Style of internal figures (realistic → chibi)  
- Additions of accessories (tool set, helmets, gear base)  
- Visual texture enhancement (realistic rendering of surface materials)  
- Perspective (isometric view of box)  
- Labeling ("DUAL TRANSFORMER HEROES")  

Step 2 - Determine the elements that should remain unchanged  
Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements: The original toy’s identity hinges on specific visual cues that define its dual nature as a transformable vehicle-robot. Key among these are:  
- The **horseshoe-shaped grille** with central mesh — this is an iconic design element borrowed from real-world luxury vehicles (e.g., Bugatti), serving as a primary identifier. If removed or altered, the car’s brand identity is lost.  
- The **red-and-black color scheme** — this is consistent across both forms and serves as a signature aesthetic. While metallic sheen may be enhanced, the base colors must remain.  
- The **structural transformation logic**: the robot’s arms being formed from the car’s doors, and the legs from the wheels and undercarriage — this functional relationship must be preserved in any depiction to maintain the "transformer" concept.  
- The **presence of the car and robot as distinct but related forms** — even if stylized internally, the external display must reflect the original duality.  

Functional/logical association elements:  
- The **mechanical articulation points** — such as the pivot joints at the shoulders and hips — are essential to convey transformability. Even if simplified, they must be visually implied.  
- The **position relationship between car and robot** — the robot standing behind the car, suggesting transformation origin — must be preserved in the final display to maintain narrative logic.  

Non-modified element deduction:  
After excluding allowed changes (background, accessories, style of internal figures), the following remain unchanged:  
- The **color distribution** (red side panels, black body, silver wheels)  
- The **grille shape and placement**  
- The **overall silhouette** of both forms  
- The **wheel design** (five-spoke silver rims)  
- The **gold chest armor pattern** on the robot  
- The **headlight and taillight placements** (white strips on front and sides)  

Preservation Targets List:  
- Horseshoe-shaped grille with central mesh  
- Red-and-black paint scheme  
- Five-spoke silver wheels  
- Gold-plated segmented chest armor on robot  
- Structural transformation logic (doors become arms, wheels become legs)  
- Positional relationship between car and robot (car in front, robot behind)  
- White stripe accents on front and sides of car

    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The horseshoe-shaped grille with central mesh is a key identifying feature borrowed from real-world luxury car design, specifically associated with Bugatti models. It is positioned centrally on the front of the car and is critical for brand recognition. In the robot form, it appears on the face/upper torso area, maintaining its shape and position. Its loss would make the toy unrecognizable as a derivative of that iconic design language. Thus, it is a core identity element with a weight of 3 points.
    Question: Is the horseshoe-shaped grille with central mesh present on the front of the car and on the robot’s face/torso?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The red-and-black color scheme is the dominant visual identity of the toy. The red covers the side panels, front bumper, and door sections, while black dominates the roof, hood, and lower body. This contrast is essential for visual distinction and thematic consistency across both forms. Altering the base colors would fundamentally change the toy’s identity. Therefore, this is a core recognition feature with a weight of 3 points.
    Question: Are the side panels, front bumper, and door sections red, and the roof, hood, and lower body black?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3

{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The five-spoke silver wheels are a defining detail of the car’s design and are retained in the robot’s limbs (as feet). Their shape and material finish contribute to the realistic automotive aesthetic. Changing the wheel design would disrupt the connection between car and robot forms and reduce authenticity. This is a key functional and visual detail, thus assigned a weight of 2 points.
    Question: Do both the car and robot feature five-spoke silver wheels?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2

{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The gold-plated segmented chest armor on the robot is a unique design element that adds mechanical detail and distinguishes it from generic robot toys. It is located on the torso and has a symmetrical, layered structure. Its absence would diminish the robot’s visual complexity and uniqueness. As a key accessory-like feature, it is important for identification and thus assigned a weight of 2 points.
    Question: Does the robot have gold-colored segmented armor plates on its chest?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The structural transformation logic — where the car’s doors become the robot’s arms and the wheels become the legs — is the core functional principle of the toy. This mechanical relationship must be visually preserved to maintain the "transformer" identity. If the arms are not derived from the doors or legs from wheels, the toy loses its transformative essence. This is a logical-functional element, critical to identity, hence a weight of 3 points.
    Question: Are the robot’s arms formed from the car’s doors and fenders, and its legs from the car’s wheels and undercarriage?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The positional relationship — with the car in the foreground and the robot standing behind it — establishes the narrative of transformation. This spatial arrangement helps viewers understand the dual nature of the toy. Reversing or removing this layout would confuse the viewer about the relationship between the two forms. It is an important scene element, thus assigned a weight of 2 points.
    Question: Is the car positioned in front of the robot, with the robot standing upright behind it?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The white stripe accents on the front bumper and sides of the car serve as visual highlights and are consistent with the design language of high-performance vehicles. They are present on both the car and robot forms (on the robot’s shoulders and face). Removing them would reduce visual coherence and brand fidelity. While not as critical as the grille, they are important detail elements contributing to overall consistency. Assigned a weight of 1 point.
    Question: Are there white stripes on the front bumper and side panels of the car, and on the robot’s shoulders and face?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
