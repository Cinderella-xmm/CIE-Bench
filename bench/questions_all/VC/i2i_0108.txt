Description of reference image: The subject is a superhero character wearing a detailed costume that includes a helmet with an "A" logo, a textured suit with red, white, and blue colors, and a star emblem on the chest. He is holding a circular shield featuring a concentric design of red, white, and blue rings with a metallic star in the center. The background is blurred, suggesting an urban environment. The character's posture is upright and assertive, with his arms positioned to suggest readiness.

### Step 1 - Allowed Changes List:

Thinking process: The instructions specify transforming the character into a 3D half-body figure breaking out of a TV screen, with a shield-raising pose. The new scene involves an augmented reality display effect, which implies that the background and parts of the character's environment can be altered.

Allowed Changes List:
Specific element 1 that allows for changes: The character's current background can be replaced with a television screen or augmented reality setting.
(Specific element 2 that allows for changes): The proportions of the character can be adjusted to fit the 3D half-body form breaking out of the screen.
(Specific element 3 that allows for changes): The angle and lighting can be adjusted to simulate an augmented reality effect.

### Step 2 - Determination of Elements That Should Remain Unchanged:

Thinking process: Core recognition elements include the unique costume design, the iconic shield, the helmet with the "A" logo, and the character's general posture. Functional elements like the shield's placement in the character's hand should remain to maintain the action logic. Remaining elements, such as the overall color scheme and costume details, contribute to visual coherence.

Preservation Targets List:​
(Element 1 that should be maintained): The costume design, including the red, white, and blue color scheme, and the star emblem.
(Element 2 that should be maintained): The character's helmet with the "A" logo.
(Element 3 that should be maintained): The shield, with its concentric design and central star.
(Element 4 that should be maintained): The character's general posture and readiness.
(Element 5 that should be maintained): The character’s overall color palette and texture details.
