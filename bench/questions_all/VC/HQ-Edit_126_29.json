      "thinking_process": "The dark polished wooden casing of the grandfather clock is its core identity feature — its shape, material, and carving style distinguish it from other clocks. If this were altered in form or material, it would no longer be recognizable as a traditional Victorian grandfather clock. This is a 3-point element due to its role in defining the subject.",
      "question": "Is the dark polished wooden casing of the grandfather clock present with its original shape, carvings, and finish?",

      "thinking_process": "The glass panel revealing the pendulum and weights is a functional and iconic detail of grandfather clocks. Its transparency and internal mechanics are critical to identifying the object as such. Removing or obscuring it would destroy the authenticity of the clock’s design, making it unrecognizable as a working antique clock. This is a 3-point element.",
      "question": "Is the glass panel of the clock clearly visible, showing the pendulum and weights inside?",

      "thinking_process": "The carved base with the central medallion is a distinctive decorative feature unique to this clock model. It contributes to the clock’s ornamental identity and craftsmanship. Altering it would reduce its authenticity and make it visually inconsistent with the original. This is a 2-point element as it is important but secondary to the main structure.",
      "question": "Is the carved base of the clock present with the circular medallion at its center?",

      "thinking_process": "The red Persian rug with a central medallion and geometric border is a key decorative element that anchors the floor space and complements the Victorian theme. Its pattern and color are specific and non-replaceable without affecting the scene’s coherence. This is a 2-point element due to its importance in composition and style.",
      "question": "Is the red Persian-style rug with a central medallion and geometric border fully visible on the floor?",
      "choices": [

      "thinking_process": "The green tufted velvet armchair is a signature piece of Victorian furniture. Its shape, upholstery, and curved legs are visually distinct and contribute to the room’s authenticity. Replacing it would alter the period atmosphere. This is a 2-point element due to its role in setting the scene.",
      "question": "Is the green tufted velvet armchair with curved arms and ornate legs present in the room?",

      "thinking_process": "The fireplace mantel with its ornate carvings and iron grate is a structural centerpiece. Its design and placement support the surrounding objects and define the room’s focal point. Altering its form would disrupt spatial logic and historical accuracy. This is a 2-point element.",
      "question": "Is the fireplace mantel with carved details and iron grate present in its original position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The window with green drapes and radiator below is a key source of natural light and functional detail. The vertical radiator fins and curtain folds are specific and contribute to realism. Changing them would affect lighting and spatial believability. This is a 1-point element as it is important but less central than the clock or rug.",
      "question": "Is the window with green drapes and vertical radiator fins beneath it still present?",

      "thinking_process": "The brass scale and metal tea kettle near the fireplace are minor but identifiable objects that add narrative depth. Their presence contributes to the lived-in feel of the room. While not core, removing them would slightly reduce visual coherence. This is a 1-point element.",
      "question": "Are the brass scale and metal tea kettle positioned near the fireplace?",
