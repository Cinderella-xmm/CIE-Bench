**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a Black African woman in mid-dance, captured in a dynamic pose with her right leg lifted high and left arm raised, holding a colorful cloth. She wears traditional attire: a beaded top and skirt composed of vibrant geometric patterns in red, yellow, blue, and orange; multiple beaded necklaces, bracelets, anklets, and bangles in rainbow hues; and a headband matching the garment’s color scheme. Her hair is styled in tight braids, and she wears small earrings. The background features a rural African village with thatched-roof huts made of woven reeds and mud, acacia trees with flat green canopies, distant mountains under a partly cloudy sky. On the ground, several elephants are resting or interacting with human figures who appear to be engaged in daily activities—some seated, some standing. The scene is rendered in warm earth tones with strong lighting suggesting midday sun.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction states: *"Transform the dancing woman into an Art Nouveau-inspired piece of stained glass."* This implies a complete stylistic transformation of the **subject’s form**, including texture, material appearance, and artistic medium—but not necessarily her **pose**, **identity**, or **core attributes**. The instruction explicitly says to *"retain her dynamic pose and colorful garments"*, so these must remain unchanged in structure and position. It also specifies *"stylizing them with intricate geometric patterns and flowing lines"*, meaning the **design elements** (like colors and patterns) can be reinterpreted artistically, but their **presence and function** must persist.

For the scene: *"Reimagine the rural African village as a serene, dreamlike landscape with curvilinear trees and huts, using a muted color palette resembling iridescent glass..."* — this clearly indicates **the entire background environment is allowed to change**, including its style, color scheme, and architectural forms. However, the instruction does **not** say to remove or alter the **presence** of key elements such as huts, trees, or animals—only to re-envision them in a new aesthetic.

Therefore, changes allowed include:
- Style of the woman: transformed into stained glass (texture, line work, light transmission).
- Color palette of the background: shifted to muted, iridescent tones.
- Shape of natural and built elements: curved, stylized, organic forms.
- Overall atmosphere: dreamlike, harmonious, ornamental.

But **retained** are:
- The woman's **dynamic dance pose** (right leg lifted, arms extended).
- The **structure and location** of her **colorful garments** (top, skirt, accessories).
- The **presence** of the **huts, trees, elephants, and humans** in the background (though their form may change).
- The **relative spatial relationships** between the dancer and background elements (e.g., she remains in the foreground, others in the midground).

**Allowed Changes List:**  
(Specific element 1 that allows for changes): The surface texture and rendering style of the dancing woman (to become stained glass).  
(Specific element 2 that allows for changes): The color palette of the entire scene (shifted to muted, iridescent tones).  
(Specific element 3 that allows for changes): The shape and form of trees, huts, and animals (curved, stylized, organic).  
(Specific element 4 that allows for changes): The overall atmosphere and lighting (transformed into dreamlike, harmonious, ornamental).  
(Specific element 5 that allows for changes): The material appearance of all objects (reimagined as glass-like, translucent, refractive).

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
Core recognition elements:  
The **dancing woman** is the central subject. Her identity is defined by her **distinctive pose**—a high kick with one leg bent upward, arms raised asymmetrically—and her **traditional clothing**, especially the **beaded patterned top and skirt**, which are iconic visual markers of African cultural dress. These are essential for recognizing her as the original figure, even if stylized. The **specificity of her posture**—mid-leap, body angled forward, head turned—must be preserved because it defines the action and emotional energy of the image.

Functional/logical association elements:  
Her **position relative to the village** is important. She stands in the **foreground**, centered and elevated, while the village lies behind her. This spatial hierarchy emphasizes her as the focal point. If the background is changed, her **placement within the scene** must remain consistent to preserve narrative logic. Additionally, **her interaction with the cloth**—held aloft in her right hand—is a functional gesture tied to the dance, so the **hand position and object attachment** must be retained.

Non-modified element deduction:  
Although the instruction allows changing the **style** of the clothes and skin (to stained glass), it mandates retaining the **colorful garments** and **dynamic pose**. Therefore, the **existence** of the **beaded top**, **patterned skirt**, **necklaces**, **bracelets**, and **anklets** must be preserved—even if their textures are altered. Similarly, the **elephants and humans** in the background must still be present, though their forms may be stylized.

Importantly, the **number and arrangement** of elephants (e.g., group on left, individual on right) and **humans** (seated vs. standing) should remain consistent in count and relative positions to maintain scene coherence.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
(The dynamic pose of the woman, including raised right leg and extended arms)  
(The presence and structure of the colorful beaded top and patterned skirt)  
(The presence of multiple bracelets, anklets, necklaces, and headband)  
(The presence of at least five elephants in the background)  
(The presence of at least three human figures in the background)  
(The relative spatial positioning: dancer in foreground, huts and animals in midground)  
(The presence of two thatched huts visible in the scene)  
(The presence of acacia trees in the background)

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The dynamic pose—specifically the right leg lifted high with knee bent and foot pointed downward, combined with the left arm reaching upward and the body leaning forward—is the core identity feature of the dancer. It defines the action and energy of the scene. Losing this pose would make the figure unrecognizable as a dancer in motion. This is a structural and kinetic identifier, essential for continuity. Therefore, it carries a weight of 3 points.
    Question: Is the dancer’s right leg raised high with the knee bent and foot pointed down, and is her left arm extended upward while her body leans forward?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The beaded top and patterned skirt are central to the cultural identity and visual richness of the subject. Their specific design—horizontal stripes of red, yellow, blue, and orange in geometric patterns—is a key identifying feature. Even if stylized, their presence and basic structure must be preserved. Removing or altering them fundamentally changes the subject’s cultural representation. This is a critical accessory element, thus weighted at 3 points.
    Question: Are the beaded top and patterned skirt visibly present on the dancer, maintaining their distinct horizontal striped and geometric designs?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The multiple bracelets, anklets, necklaces, and headband are signature adornments that define the dancer’s traditional attire. Their layered, multicolored appearance is a core detail that contributes to the visual complexity and authenticity of the character. While their texture may change to glass-like, their existence and placement must be preserved. This is an important accessory detail affecting cultural accuracy, hence 2 points.
    Question: Are there multiple bracelets on both wrists, anklets on both ankles, a multi-layered necklace around the neck, and a headband on the head?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The presence of at least five elephants in the background is a key environmental element that establishes the setting. Their number and distribution (e.g., cluster on the left, isolated ones on the right) contribute to the narrative depth and realism of the village scene. Although they may be stylized, their existence and approximate count must be maintained for consistency. This is an important scene element, thus 2 points.
    Question: Are there at least five elephants visible in the background, positioned near the huts and scattered across the ground?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The presence of at least three human figures in the background—some seated, some standing—adds social context to the scene. Their inclusion is necessary to convey a village setting. Even if stylized, their number and general positions (left side, right side, center) must be preserved to maintain logical coherence. This is a secondary but significant scene element, therefore 2 points.
    Question: Are there at least three human figures visible in the background, with some seated and some standing near the huts?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The two thatched huts with conical roofs are iconic architectural elements of the African village. Their presence anchors the scene geographically. Even if transformed into curvilinear shapes, their basic form and number must be preserved. This is a key environmental feature that helps identify the setting, so it is weighted at 2 points.
    Question: Are there two distinct thatched-roof huts visible in the background, one on the left and one on the right side of the scene?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The acacia trees with flat, umbrella-shaped canopies are characteristic of African savanna landscapes. Their presence reinforces the geographical setting. Although their forms may be stylized into curvilinear shapes, their silhouette and placement in the background must remain recognizable. This is a minor but coherent detail contributing to environmental authenticity, thus 1 point.
    Question: Are there at least two acacia trees with flat, rounded canopies visible in the background behind the huts?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}
{
    Q8: 
    Thinking process: The dancer’s position in the foreground, with the village elements in the midground, establishes the spatial hierarchy of the composition. This layout is essential for narrative clarity and visual focus. Altering this relationship would disrupt the viewer’s understanding of the scene. Though not a core identity feature, it is a critical compositional element, hence 2 points.
    Question: Is the dancer positioned in the foreground, clearly separated from the background elements like huts and elephants?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
