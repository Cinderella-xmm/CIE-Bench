**Step 1 – Analyze the editing instructions and determine allowed changes**

Description of reference image:  
The subject is a full-length stone statue of a robed male figure, standing upright on a multi-tiered stone pedestal. The figure has long hair and a beard, wears flowing robes with draped folds, and holds one hand raised in a gesture, possibly blessing or pointing. The statue is made of light-colored stone, showing weathering and texture consistent with outdoor exposure. The base is rectangular, constructed from large blocks of light beige stone, featuring architectural detailing such as cornices, decorative carvings on the front face (including an inscription "1882"), and a small black plaque near the bottom. The pedestal is situated on a paved area surrounded by a low chain barrier supported by stone posts. In the background are green trees, parked cars, a building with a sign reading “Ancienne École,” and a clear blue sky. The lighting suggests late afternoon sun casting shadows to the right.

Thinking process:  
The editing instruction explicitly transforms the statue and its base into a **detailed miniature scene within a glass dome**, reimagining the statue as a **sleek metallic 3D figure**, surrounding it with **diminutive trees with translucent leaves**, adding **engraved mini plaques with historical texts**, and placing the entire setup on a **polished stone stand with vine patterns**. This transformation implies that:

- The **form, material, and appearance** of the statue can be changed (from stone to metallic).
- The **base structure** can be reimagined (now part of a dome scene).
- The **surrounding environment** (trees, ground, vehicles, buildings) is not required to be preserved — they are implied to be replaced or removed.
- The **new elements introduced** (glass dome, translucent trees, engraved plaques, vine-patterned stand) are additions, not constraints on retention.

Thus, the following elements are **allowed to change**:
- The **material and style of the statue** (stone → metallic).
- The **appearance and form of the base** (replaced by a dome scene).
- The **overall scale and context** (real-world monument → miniature diorama).
- The **background environment** (urban setting → enclosed dome scene).
- The **texture and color** of the statue and base (weathered stone → polished metal and engraved details).

Allowed Changes List:  
(Specific element 1 that allows for changes): The statue’s material and surface finish (e.g., from weathered stone to sleek metallic).  
(Specific element 2 that allows for changes): The base’s structural form and surface details (e.g., replaced with a domed enclosure and engraved plaques).  
(Specific element 3 that allows for changes): The surrounding environment (e.g., trees, cars, buildings, pavement).  
(Specific element 4 that allows for changes): The scale and framing (e.g., from life-sized monument to miniature scene).  
(Specific element 5 that allows for changes): The lighting and atmospheric conditions (e.g., natural daylight → controlled indoor illumination).

**Step 2 – Determine the elements that should remain unchanged**

Thinking process:  
Despite the extensive transformation described, we must identify what **must remain unchanged** based on the original image’s visual content and logical coherence.

Core recognition elements:  
- The **identity of the statue as a robed male figure** with a **raised hand** and **bearded face** is critical to recognizing the subject as a religious or historical figure (likely St. Michel, given the name on the base). Even if transformed into a metallic version, this **posture and iconography** must be preserved to maintain identity.
- The **presence of the robe with specific draping folds** is a key identifier — altering its shape entirely would lose the essence of the figure.
- The **pedestal’s position and orientation** relative to the statue (front-facing, elevated) must be retained, even if the base is redesigned, because it defines the relationship between the figure and its foundation.

Functional/logical association elements:  
- The **statue stands atop the pedestal**, which is a functional and spatial relationship. Even in the miniature dome, the figure must remain positioned above the base.
- The **inscription “1882”** on the front of the base is a historical marker; if removed or altered, it loses contextual authenticity. It must be preserved, even if rendered as an engraved mini plaque in the new design.
- The **black plaque** on the base likely contains commemorative text — its presence and placement must be maintained to preserve informational continuity.

Non-modified element deduction:  
- While the **color** of the statue may change (stone → metal), the **shape of the head, facial features (beard, eyes), and hand gesture** must remain intact.
- The **overall silhouette and proportions** of the figure (tall, upright, robed) must be preserved to avoid misidentification.
- The **position of the statue on the pedestal** and the **orientation of the base** (facing forward) must remain consistent.
- Although the **chain barrier** and **pavement** are part of the original scene, they are not mentioned in the instructions and thus are **not required to be retained** — they fall under the allowed changes.

Preservation Targets List:  
(Element 1 that should be maintained): The statue’s posture — standing upright with one hand raised.  
(Element 2 that should be maintained): The presence of a beard and long hair on the figure’s head.  
(Element 3 that should be maintained): The flowing robe with distinct drapery folds.  
(Element 4 that should be maintained): The inscription “1882” on the front face of the base.  
(Element 5 that should be maintained): The black plaque located near the bottom of the base.  
(Element 6 that should be maintained): The figure’s position atop the pedestal, maintaining vertical alignment.

**Step 3 – Generate yes/no questions based on key identifying visual elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The raised hand gesture is a core identification feature of the statue, distinguishing it from other figures. This pose is central to the figure's identity and symbolic meaning (possibly a blessing or proclamation). If the hand is lowered or repositioned, the figure’s identity and intent are lost. Thus, preserving this specific gesture is essential for recognition and consistency.
    Question: Is the statue’s right hand raised in a gesture with fingers extended upward?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The beard and long hair are distinctive facial features that define the figure’s appearance and likely religious or historical identity. Altering or removing them would make the figure unrecognizable as the same entity. These traits are iconic and cannot be changed without losing identity.
    Question: Does the statue have a visible beard and long hair on the head?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The flowing robe with pronounced drapery folds is a defining visual characteristic of the statue’s clothing. Its shape and flow contribute to the figure’s dignity and period-specific style. Changing the fabric’s form or eliminating folds would distort the figure’s appearance and historical context.
    Question: Are there clearly visible folds and drapes in the robe covering the statue’s body?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The year “1882” inscribed on the front of the base is a key historical detail that anchors the monument in time. Its presence and legibility are crucial for maintaining the work’s authenticity and informational value. Removing or altering it would erase a significant part of the monument’s identity.
    Question: Is the year “1882” visibly inscribed on the front face of the pedestal?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The black plaque at the base is a functional element containing likely commemorative text. Its presence indicates a formal dedication or historical note. Even if resized or stylized in the miniature version, its existence must be preserved to retain the monument’s narrative purpose.
    Question: Is there a dark rectangular plaque affixed to the lower front section of the base?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The statue’s vertical positioning atop the pedestal is a structural and compositional necessity. It reflects the monument’s intended display and spatial hierarchy. If the figure is placed sideways or detached from the base, the relationship is broken, undermining the original design logic.
    Question: Is the statue positioned directly on top of the pedestal, aligned vertically?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
