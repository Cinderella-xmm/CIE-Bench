      "thinking_process": "The triangular panel structure is a defining design feature of the Salomon Speedcross series, serving both aesthetic and structural purposes. Its presence and arrangement are critical for identifying the model. If lost or altered in shape, the shoe would no longer be recognizable as a Speedcross. Thus, preserving the **triangular overlay pattern** is essential for core identity.",
      "question": "Is the triangular panel structure across the midfoot preserved in shape and spatial arrangement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The \"SPEEDCROSS\" text with its multicolored stripe is a key branding element located along the lateral side of the shoe. Its position and font style are unique to this model. Even when converted to wood, the **text placement and direction** must remain consistent to ensure model recognition. Losing this would undermine brand identity.",
      "question": "Is the \"SPEEDCROSS\" text positioned along the lateral side of the shoe in the same location and orientation as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The Salomon logo on the heel counter and tongue tab is a primary brand identifier. Its placement is fixed and standardized across models. Altering its position or removing it would make the shoe unidentifiable as a Salomon product. Therefore, the **logo’s location and shape** must be preserved even in sculpted form.",
      "question": "Are the Salomon logos present on both the heel counter and tongue tab in their original positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The lacing system, including the number and alignment of eyelets, defines the shoe’s closure mechanism and contributes to its structural design. Changing the lacing path or eyelet count would distort the functional and visual integrity of the shoe. Thus, the **lacing layout and eyelet positions** must be preserved.",
      "question": "Is the lacing system maintained with the same number and spacing of eyelets as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The outsole features a specific lug pattern and the \"contagrip\" text, which are signature elements of Salomon trail shoes. The **shape and spacing of the lugs**, as well as the **location of the \"contagrip\" label**, are crucial for identifying the shoe’s purpose and brand. Any deviation would misrepresent the product.",
      "question": "Is the outsole lug pattern and the \"contagrip\" text preserved in their original positions and shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The toe cap has a distinct reinforced shape with an embossed \"S\" logo, which is a functional and branding detail. Its form is critical for recognizing the front profile of the shoe. Even in wood, the **shape of the toe cap and the \"S\" logo** must be retained to preserve identity.",
      "question": "Is the reinforced toe cap shape and the embossed \"S\" logo preserved in the same location and form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The \"LT LIGHT WEIGHT MIDSOLE\" label is a technical specification indicator placed near the heel. While smaller, it is a key detail that identifies the shoe’s construction type. Its **position and rectangular shape** must be preserved to maintain informational accuracy.",
      "question": "Is the \"LT LIGHT WEIGHT MIDSOLE\" label present in the same location and shape near the heel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
