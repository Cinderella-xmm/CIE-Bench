Description of reference image: The subject is a young elephant standing near water, shown in profile view facing right. The elephant has a wrinkled gray hide, small ears, and a curved trunk. It appears to be standing on a rock edge with its front leg slightly raised, surrounded by other elephants partially visible in the background. The background contains water with a earthy brown tone.

Thinking process:
Analyzing the editing instructions, we see that the primary focus is changing the background to a matte solid gray, eliminating shadows while retaining a minimalistic design. This implies the elephant and its posture remain the central subject. The instructions do not mention altering the elephantâ€™s appearance, position, or posture, indicating these aspects should stay intact. 

### Allowed Changes List:
1. Change the background from a natural setting to a matte solid gray.
2. Remove all shadows present in the original image.

### Preservation Targets List:
1. The detailed textures of the elephant's wrinkled skin.
2. The elephant's posture, including the raised front leg and curved trunk.
3. The elephant's proportions, including its ears and trunk shape.
4. The elephant's relative position on the rock edge.
5. The overall profile orientation of the elephant.
