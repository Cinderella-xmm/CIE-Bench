      "thinking_process": "The key recognition feature of this portrait is the distinct facial structure of George Washington, particularly the long, straight nose, deep-set eyes, and defined jawline. These features are universally associated with his likeness in historical art. Altering them would render the figure unrecognizable as Washington, even in a stylized version. Therefore, preserving these facial contours is essential for identity retention and qualifies as a core identity element.",
      "question": "Is the subject's face clearly showing the same facial structure as in the original image, including the long nose, high cheekbones, and symmetrical eye placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The white powdered wig with its characteristic curls and volume is an iconic element of Washington’s appearance in official portraits. It serves as a critical identifier distinguishing him from other historical figures. Even in a steampunk reinterpretation, this hairstyle must be preserved in form and placement to maintain recognition. Its absence or radical alteration would compromise the subject’s identity.",
      "question": "Does the subject retain the white powdered wig with voluminous curls framing the sides of the head, matching the original hairstyle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The seated pose is explicitly instructed to be maintained. The position of the hands on the armrests and the upright posture are functional components of the composition. Changing the pose would violate the instruction and disrupt the visual continuity between the original and edited images. Thus, the spatial relationship of the limbs and torso must remain consistent.",
      "question": "Are both hands positioned on the armrests of the chair, with fingers relaxed and palms facing downward, mirroring the original posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The frontal orientation of the head and body is a defining compositional choice in the original portrait. It emphasizes dignity and directness. While the background and costume may change, the subject must still face forward without significant tilt or turn. Deviating from this would alter the intended presence and authority conveyed by the figure.",
      "question": "Is the head and body oriented directly forward, with no lateral tilt or rotation, maintaining the original frontal view?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The proportional balance of the figure—specifically the relative size of the head, torso, and limbs—is crucial for maintaining realism and recognition. Even in a stylized version, extreme distortions (e.g., elongated neck, oversized head) would make the figure unidentifiable. Preserving natural human proportions ensures the subject remains grounded in the original likeness.",
      "question": "Does the figure maintain the same proportionate body structure as in the original, with balanced head-to-body ratio and anatomically accurate limb lengths?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The lighting direction from the upper left creates a specific shadow pattern on the face and clothing, contributing to depth and three-dimensionality. While the lighting tone may shift due to the steampunk theme, the directional source should remain consistent to preserve the original modeling of the face and form. This affects how the subject is perceived in terms of volume and expression.",
      "question": "Is the light source still coming from the upper left, casting shadows on the right side of the face and clothing as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The symmetry of the composition—particularly in the alignment of the shoulders, arms, and facial features—is a hallmark of classical portraiture. Maintaining symmetry supports the dignified tone of the image. While minor artistic liberties may be taken, significant asymmetry would disrupt the intended balance and coherence.",
      "question": "Are the shoulders, arms, and facial features aligned symmetrically, with no noticeable imbalance in positioning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
