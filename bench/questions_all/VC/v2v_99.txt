### Step 1 - Description of Reference Image and Allowed Changes List:

**Description of Reference Image:**  
The subject is a soccer player wearing a red jersey with "RONALOO" and the number "7" printed on the back. He is captured mid-action, kicking a soccer ball towards the goalpost. The player is wearing white shorts with green stripes, red socks, and yellow cleats. The background shows a large stadium filled with spectators, bright stadium lights, and a clear blue sky. The goalkeeper, dressed in green, is positioned near the goal.

**Thinking Process:**  
The editing instructions specify transforming the soccer player into a charming chibi-style 3D figure while keeping the soccer field, stadium, and cheering crowd realistic. This means the player's physical form, proportions, and style can be altered, but the scene's realism must be preserved.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
1. The soccer player's form can be changed to a chibi-style 3D figure.
2. Proportions of the soccer player can be adjusted to fit the chibi style.
3. The player's facial features and details can be simplified for the chibi style.

### Step 2 - Determination of Elements That Should Remain Unchanged:

**Thinking Process:**  
Core recognition elements include the player's jersey text ("RONALOO" and "7"), the action of kicking the ball, and the realistic depiction of the stadium and crowd. Functional/logical elements include the ball's trajectory toward the goal and the goalkeeper's position. Remaining elements like the stadium lights and field markings should also be retained for visual coherence.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
1. The text "RONALOO" and "7" on the jersey.
2. The action of kicking the ball toward the goal.
3. The realistic stadium, crowd, and field.
4. The goalkeeper's position near the goal.
5. The soccer ball's trajectory.
