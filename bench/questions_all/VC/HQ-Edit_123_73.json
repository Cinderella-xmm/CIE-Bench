      "thinking_process": "The **grayish stone texture** is a core identity feature of the pyramid, distinguishing it from other structures. Its weathered surface with darkened areas and erosion lines is essential to recognizing it as an ancient Mesoamerican ruin. If replaced with smooth or metallic textures without trace of original material, the authenticity is lost. This element is crucial for historical and architectural identification, making it a weight-3 element.",
      "question": "Is the original grayish stone texture of the pyramid’s surface retained, including visible weathering and erosion patterns?",

      "thinking_process": "The **rectangular temple platform** at the top is a unique architectural feature of Mayan pyramids like El Castillo. Its flat roof and defined edges are key identifiers. Even if transformed into an eye, the **basic rectangular shape** must remain to preserve the original structure’s identity. Losing this would make the structure unrecognizable as a Mayan pyramid.",
      "question": "Is the top platform of the pyramid preserved as a flat, rectangular structure with defined edges?",

      "thinking_process": "The **central staircase** is a functional and iconic element of the pyramid, running down the front face. Its position and alignment are essential to the pyramid’s symmetry and design. Even if transformed into armored segments, the **path and placement** must follow the original staircase. Altering its position would disrupt the spatial logic of the structure.",
      "question": "Does the central staircase remain aligned along the front face of the pyramid, extending from the top temple to the base?",

      "thinking_process": "The **nine-tiered structure** is a specific architectural detail that defines this type of pyramid. Each tier decreases in size as it ascends, creating a stepped pyramid. Even if morphed into armored segments, the **number and stacking sequence** must be preserved to maintain structural accuracy. Losing this would alter the pyramid’s identity.",
      "question": "Are there exactly nine distinct tiers visible in the pyramid’s structure, decreasing in size from bottom to top?",

      "thinking_process": "The **presence of moss and vegetation** on the edges and steps indicates natural aging and integration with the environment. This detail adds authenticity and visual coherence. While the jungle around it may be transformed, the **vegetation growing directly on the pyramid** should remain as evidence of its ancient state. Removing it would make the structure appear artificially clean or new.",
      "question": "Are patches of moss and small vegetation visible along the edges and steps of the pyramid?",

      "thinking_process": "The **original lighting direction** (sunlight from upper left casting shadows to lower right) creates depth and realism. Preserving this ensures the scene remains visually coherent and grounded in reality, even if fantastical elements are added. Changing light direction without reason would distort spatial perception.",
      "question": "Is the shadow cast by the pyramid positioned to the lower right, consistent with sunlight coming from the upper left?",

      "thinking_process": "The **position of the pyramid within the jungle** is a key environmental context. It must remain centered in a dense forest, with trees surrounding it on all sides. Moving it or isolating it would break the original scene’s logic. This spatial relationship is important for maintaining the sense of discovery and isolation typical of ancient ruins.",
      "question": "Is the pyramid located in the center of a dense tropical jungle, with trees surrounding it on all sides?",

      "thinking_process": "The **moss-covered top platform** is a subtle but significant detail—indicating long-term exposure and natural growth. While the top may become an eye, the **surface should retain traces of moss or organic material**, reflecting the original condition. This supports the narrative of ancientness and integration with nature.",
      "question": "Is the top platform of the pyramid covered with dry soil and patches of moss, indicating natural overgrowth?",

      "thinking_process": "The **white vehicles** in the foreground are minor but real-world elements. While they may be removed or stylized, their presence provides scale and modern contrast. If removed entirely without replacement, it could affect the viewer’s understanding of scale. However, since they are not core to the pyramid’s identity, their retention is secondary.",
      "question": "Are there multiple white vehicles parked on the grassy area near the base of the pyramid?",
