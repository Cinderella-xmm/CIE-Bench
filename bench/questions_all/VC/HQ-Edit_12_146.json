      "thinking_process": "The facial structure, particularly the shape of the eyes, nose, beard, and smile, constitutes the core identity of the individual. Altering these would result in a different person, undermining the continuity of the subject. The wide smile with visible teeth and upward gaze are distinctive expressions that define the emotional tone and identity of the portrait. This is a 3-point element because losing it would make the subject unrecognizable.",
      "question": "Is the facial structure including the eyes, nose, beard, and smile preserved exactly as in the original image?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The henna-like floral patterns on the cheeks are unique decorative elements that contribute to the cultural and aesthetic identity of the subject. They are clearly visible and stylized, serving as a signature feature. Their removal or alteration would diminish the authenticity and recognizability of the character's appearance. As they are not mentioned in the editing instruction, they must be preserved.",
      "question": "Are the blue and green floral henna designs on the cheeks present and unchanged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The gold earrings in both ears are small but significant details that contribute to the overall ornamentation and symmetry of the subject. They are consistent with the cultural theme and serve as anchor points in the composition. Since the instruction does not mention replacing them, their presence must be maintained for visual coherence.",
      "question": "Are the small gold earrings visible in both ears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The peacock feather held in the right hand is a symbolic object and a key visual motif in the image. It connects to the headpiece and reinforces the cultural theme. Even if the hand accessories are reimagined, the feather’s presence should be preserved as a continuity element. Its absence would break the thematic link between the head and hand.",
      "question": "Is the peacock feather held in the right hand present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The hand posture, specifically the way the right hand holds the feather near the chest, is a deliberate pose indicating reverence or pride. Changing this would alter the emotional intent of the image. Since the instruction does not specify changing the pose, it must be preserved for logical consistency.",
      "question": "Is the right hand positioned near the chest, holding the peacock feather?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The gaze direction — upward and to the left — contributes to the subject’s expression of aspiration or contemplation. This directional cue is critical for emotional interpretation. Since no instruction mentions changing the head angle or eye direction, it must be retained.",
      "question": "Is the subject looking upward and toward the left side of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The skin tone and texture provide natural realism and contrast with the vibrant attire. Altering it would affect the biological identity of the subject. Though not explicitly protected, it is not mentioned for change, so it should be preserved as part of the original physical representation.",
      "question": "Is the natural skin tone and texture of the subject preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
