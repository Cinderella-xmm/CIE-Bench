### Description of Reference Image:
The subject is a woman standing beside a large flat-screen TV placed on a wooden table. She has shoulder-length brown hair, is smiling, and wearing a long-sleeved dusty rose-colored top paired with blue jeans. Her right hand rests lightly on the top edge of the TV screen. The background is a plain off-white wall, and the TV is turned off, displaying a black screen. The wooden table is light-colored and simple in design.

### Thinking Process:
The editing instructions specify transforming the woman into five chibi-style Russian nesting dolls while retaining her attire and stance. The scene around her, including the TV and table, should remain consistent. The instructions do not mention altering the background or the TV's position, implying these should stay unchanged. The womanâ€™s core identity elements (clothing color and style, hair color) and the scene's functional/logical associations (position of the TV and table) must be preserved.

### Allowed Changes List:
- The woman's physical form can be changed into chibi-style Russian nesting dolls.
- The size of the woman can vary among the five dolls, from largest to smallest.
- The woman's facial features can be simplified to match the chibi style.

### Thinking Process:
Core recognition elements include the woman's attire (dusty rose top and blue jeans), hair color, and the TV's position on the table. Functional/logical elements include the woman's hand placement on the TV and the table's presence beneath the TV. Remaining elements like the background wall and the TV's black screen should be retained for visual coherence.

### Preservation Targets List:
- The woman's dusty rose top and blue jeans.
- The woman's brown hair.
- The TV's position on the wooden table.
- The woman's hand placement on the TV.
- The plain off-white background wall.

Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

A: Yes
Weight: 2

### Q5:
