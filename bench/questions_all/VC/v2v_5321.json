      "thinking_process": "The black-and-white horizontally striped shirt is the most iconic feature of the mime character, directly tied to his identity. Its presence and pattern are essential for recognition. If the stripes are removed, altered in direction, or replaced with a different pattern, the character would no longer be identifiable as a traditional mime. The even spacing and horizontal orientation are critical visual cues. This element is a core identity feature, making it a 3-point question.",
      "question": "Is the character wearing a long-sleeved shirt with evenly spaced horizontal black and white stripes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The black beret is a defining accessory of the mime, especially in French theatrical tradition. It is placed on the head and has a small pin or button at the front, which adds detail and authenticity. Removing or replacing it would fundamentally alter the character’s appearance. Since the instruction specifically emphasizes retaining the beret, it is a core element. Loss of this item would compromise the character’s identity.",
      "question": "Is there a black beret on the character’s head with a small pin or button at the front edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The European rooftop setting is explicitly required to be preserved. The terracotta roofs, chimneys, and warm-toned buildings are key indicators of the location. The presence of these architectural features establishes the scene’s authenticity. Altering or removing them would violate the instruction and break the contextual link. This is a major scene element, thus weighted at 3 points.",
      "question": "Are there terracotta-colored rooftops and chimneys visible in the background behind the character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The red bow tie is a distinctive accessory that contrasts with the monochrome costume and is a standard part of the mime’s attire. It is located at the neck and is clearly visible. While not as central as the stripes or beret, it contributes significantly to the character’s visual identity. Its absence would make the costume incomplete and less recognizable. This is an important accessory, hence a 2-point question.",
      "question": "Is there a bright red bow tie centered around the character’s neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The white gloves are part of the mime’s performance uniform and are worn on both hands. They are essential for maintaining the illusion of a stylized, expressive figure. Their presence helps define the character’s actions, such as holding the phone. While not as iconic as the stripes or beret, they are a key component of the costume and must be retained for consistency. This is a significant detail, so it receives 2 points.",
      "question": "Are both hands of the character covered in white gloves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "thinking_process": "The black suspenders connect the shirt to the trousers and are a functional part of the outfit. They are visible across the chest and have metal clasps at the waist. Their presence maintains the structural integrity of the costume. While not a primary identifier, they are a necessary detail for accurate representation. Removing them would alter the silhouette and logic of the clothing. This is a secondary but important detail, so it is assigned 1 point.",
      "question": "Are there black suspenders running from the shoulders down to the trousers, with visible clasps at the waist?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The retro-style mobile phone with an antenna is being held to the ear, indicating active use. While the instruction allows for stylistic changes, the object must remain recognizable as a handheld phone. Its position and function are tied to the character’s pose and narrative. Losing this object would remove a key action element. This is a functional detail, so it is worth 2 points.",
      "question": "Is there a black handheld phone with an antenna being held to the character’s right ear?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The distant domed building in the skyline is a landmark feature of the European cityscape. It adds depth and specificity to the setting. While not the main focus, it contributes to the authenticity of the location. Its presence helps anchor the scene geographically. This is a minor but meaningful environmental detail, so it is assigned 1 point.",
      "question": "Is there a domed building visible in the distance behind the character in the skyline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
