      "thinking_process": "The alignment of three chairs directly facing the shelving unit is a core functional and spatial feature. Changing their number or orientation would disrupt the intended use of the space as a reading nook. This arrangement is critical for maintaining the logical layout of the room, even when transformed into a fantasy setting. Therefore, preserving this specific configuration ensures continuity in purpose and visual narrative.",
      "question": "Are there exactly three chairs positioned in a row, facing the bookshelf wall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The two hanging lamps are key lighting fixtures whose positions define the ambient illumination. Their placement above the seating area establishes a focal point for comfort and reading. Even if transformed into fungi, their locations must remain unchanged to preserve the spatial hierarchy and lighting logic. Removing or relocating them would break the scene’s functional integrity.",
      "question": "Are there two hanging pendant lights located above the seating area, one closer to the center and one toward the right edge of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The striped shadow pattern created by sunlight filtering through the ceiling slats is a defining visual motif. It conveys time of day, architectural structure, and natural light behavior. Altering this pattern would remove a crucial environmental cue and destroy the sense of place. While the ceiling itself may become a branch canopy, the shadow direction and spacing must remain consistent.",
      "question": "Does the floor display a pattern of parallel diagonal shadows cast by sunlight entering from the right side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The continuous wall of shelves with uniform cubby compartments is the primary identifier of the space as a library. Even if reshaped into wings, the underlying grid structure must be preserved in terms of density, height, and span. Disrupting this grid would obscure the original function and visual identity of the room.",
      "question": "Is there a full-height wall of wooden shelves running along the left side of the room, divided into multiple evenly spaced rectangular compartments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The horizontal plank flooring with consistent orientation provides a stable ground plane and contributes to the room’s warmth and cohesion. Its directionality affects perspective and movement. While texture may change (e.g., moss), the alignment and continuity of the planks must be maintained to preserve spatial depth and realism.",
      "question": "Is the floor composed of light-colored wooden planks laid horizontally, extending from foreground to background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The presence of decorative objects on the shelves (such as vases, figurines, and boxes) adds visual interest and confirms the shelves’ role as display units. These items are minor but contribute to the authenticity of the scene. Their retention ensures that the transformed shelves still resemble curated storage spaces, even if now magical.",
      "question": "Are there small decorative objects placed within some of the shelf cubbies, including a white vase and a blue box with text?",

      "thinking_process": "The warm golden-brown color scheme is central to the atmosphere of the room. It unifies all materials and enhances the natural aesthetic. While tones may shift slightly in a whimsical version, the dominance of warm earth tones must be preserved to maintain emotional and visual continuity.",
      "question": "Is the dominant color palette throughout the room composed of warm golden-brown hues across walls, ceiling, furniture, and flooring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
