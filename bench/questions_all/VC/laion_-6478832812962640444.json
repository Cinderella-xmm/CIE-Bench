      "thinking_process": "The rounded toe box is a core identity feature of Western cowboy boots, distinguishing them from other boot types such as pointed-toe or square-toe styles. Its shape contributes to the boot’s recognizability and functionality. If transformed into a sharp or angular shape, it would lose its classification as a traditional cowboy boot. Therefore, preserving the rounded toe profile is essential for maintaining the original subject’s identity.",
      "question": "Is the toe box of the boot rounded?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The high shaft with a V-shaped opening at the top is an iconic structural element of cowboy boots, directly contributing to their visual identity. This specific cutout and upward taper are signature features. Even in a sculptural reinterpretation, the basic form of the shaft must retain this V-top configuration to remain identifiable as a cowboy boot. Losing this would fundamentally alter the object’s identity.",
      "question": "Does the boot have a V-shaped opening at the top of the shaft?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The vertical white piping along the outer edge of the shaft is a distinctive detail that enhances the boot’s visual structure and craftsmanship. It marks the seam line and adds contrast. While its material may change, its position and linear continuity must be preserved to maintain consistency with the original design. Removing or relocating it would disrupt the boot’s aesthetic logic and reduce visual fidelity.",
      "question": "Is there a continuous white piping running vertically along the outer side of the shaft from the heel to the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The placement of decorative patterns on the shaft and vamp is a key design feature. These areas are traditionally adorned with embroidery, and even though the instruction calls for geometric metal inlays, the spatial distribution of these embellishments must remain consistent. The upper shaft and vamp must retain decorative coverage in the same zones to preserve the visual rhythm and balance of the original boot. Shifting or omitting these zones would misrepresent the original design.",
      "question": "Are decorative patterns present on both the upper shaft and the vamp area of the boot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The block heel is a defining functional and aesthetic component of cowboy boots. Although the instruction specifies reshaping it into a stepped architectural motif, the heel must still exist as a distinct, elevated rear portion. Its presence is necessary to maintain the boot’s structural integrity and identity. Eliminating or flattening it would transform the object into a different footwear type, undermining the original subject’s essence.",
      "question": "Is there a distinct heel block elevating the rear of the boot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The leather surface texture, particularly the visible grain and slight distressing, contributes to the authentic Western aesthetic. While the material may be changed to metal, the **visual impression of texture**—such as subtle variations in surface depth and shading—should be preserved in the new material to maintain tactile realism. The absence of any surface variation would make the sculpture appear flat and artificial, losing the richness of the original.",
      "question": "Does the surface of the boot exhibit visible texture resembling leather grain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
