      "thinking_process": "The open lid is a core identity feature of a grand piano in performance context, distinguishing it from closed or upright models. Its upward angle reveals the interior and is iconic in concert settings. If lost, the object may be mistaken for a different instrument or non-functional model. Therefore, retaining the open lid is critical for recognition.",
      "question": "Is the lid of the piano open and angled upward, revealing the internal structure?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The four-legged structure with casters is a functional and identifiable trait of grand pianos. It defines the instrument’s stability and mobility. Removing or altering the legs would fundamentally change the piano’s form and make it unrecognizable as a grand piano.",
      "question": "Does the piano have four legs, each ending in a golden caster, supporting the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The three pedals are essential functional components of a grand piano, located in a specific row beneath the keyboard. Their presence and alignment are key identifiers. Omitting them or changing their number would break the instrument’s authenticity.",
      "question": "Are there exactly three pedals positioned in a row beneath the keyboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The keyboard must maintain the standard layout of alternating white and black keys, regardless of material. The sequence and spacing define the piano’s function and identity. Even if made of sugar crystals, the visual pattern must match the original.",
      "question": "Are the keys arranged in the standard piano pattern of alternating white and black keys across the full length of the keyboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The music stand is a fixed accessory attached to the top of the piano body, used to hold sheet music. Its presence is consistent with grand piano design and contributes to the instrument’s completeness. Removing it would suggest a missing component.",
      "question": "Is there a music stand attached to the top front edge of the piano body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The hinge connecting the lid to the piano body is a structural detail that enables the lid to open. Its position is fixed and essential for the lid to function properly. Altering its location or removing it would compromise the mechanical logic of the piano.",
      "question": "Is the lid connected to the piano body via a visible hinge mechanism near the rear edge of the keyboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The overall silhouette and proportions of the piano—its elongated rectangular body, curved sides, and balanced height—are defining characteristics of a grand piano. Distorting these would make it resemble a different instrument or abstract sculpture.",
      "question": "Does the piano maintain the same elongated, curved-body silhouette and proportional dimensions as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
