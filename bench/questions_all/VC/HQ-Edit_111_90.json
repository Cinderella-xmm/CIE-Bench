      "thinking_process": "The emerald-green gemstones are the most distinctive feature of the necklace, serving as both a color anchor and a focal point. Their **oval cut**, **vibrant green hue**, and **central alignment** are critical for identifying the piece. If replaced with another color or cut, the necklace would lose its defining character. This is a core identity element, hence weight 3.",
      "question": "Are the emerald-green gemstones present in the same oval-cut shape and vibrant green color as in the original necklace?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The oxidized silver finish gives the metalwork depth and contrast, distinguishing it from polished silver. Its **darkened tone**, **high relief**, and **textured surface** are essential to the gothic-artistic style. Altering this would make the piece look like modern jewelry rather than the original. This is a key material attribute, thus weight 3.",
      "question": "Is the necklace made of metal with a darkened, oxidized silver finish, showing visible contrast in the engraved details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The intricate scrollwork and symmetrical design are signature elements of the necklace’s craftsmanship. The **repeating swirls**, **circular motifs**, and **balanced layout** define its ornate style. Losing this pattern would make it unrecognizable as the same piece. This is a structural identity marker, so weight 3.",
      "question": "Does the necklace retain the complex symmetrical scrollwork and decorative floral patterns throughout its structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The snake tail’s **lime-green color**, **scaled texture**, and **curved shape** are unique identifiers. Its presence beside the necklace creates a thematic link. Even if repositioned, the **visual properties** must remain unchanged. This is a core element of the composition, hence weight 3.",
      "question": "Is the snake tail still present with its original lime-green color, visible scales, and curved form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The **white gemstones** (diamonds or pearls) surrounding the emeralds are important for balance and contrast. Their **round shape**, **small size**, and **placement in bezels** contribute to the overall design harmony. Removing or changing them would disrupt the visual rhythm. This is a secondary but significant detail, so weight 2.",
      "question": "Are the small white gemstones still present in their original positions around the larger emerald stones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The **curvature and positioning** of the snake tail relative to the necklace create a dynamic visual flow. It wraps around the left side of the neck, forming a C-shape. This spatial relationship is key to the composition’s balance. Even in a diorama, this arc should be preserved. This is a compositional detail, hence weight 2.",
      "question": "Does the snake tail maintain its original curved path wrapping around the left side of the mannequin's neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
