      "thinking_process": "The metallic base with its engraved and perforated patterns is a core structural and decorative feature of the lantern. These patterns are distinctive of Moroccan metalwork and serve as a primary identifier. If lost, the lantern would lose its cultural authenticity and recognizability. This is a 3-point element because it defines the object’s identity.",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the metallic base of the lantern with visible engraved and perforated patterns?",

      "thinking_process": "The stained-glass body with its specific color segmentation (red, green, blue, orange) is a defining aesthetic feature. These colors and their arrangement are integral to the lantern’s visual identity. Altering them would make the object unrecognizable as the original. This is a 3-point element due to its role in identification.",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the stained-glass body of the lantern with clearly visible colored segments in red, green, blue, and orange?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The textured honeycomb-like internal surface of the glass is responsible for the lantern’s warm, diffused glow. This texture is a functional and visual hallmark. Without it, the light behavior changes fundamentally, altering the essence of the lantern. This is a 3-point element because it affects both appearance and function.",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the textured honeycomb-like internal surface of the glass body that produces a warm, diffused glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The domed finial with its tiered shape and hanging loop is a signature architectural detail of traditional Moroccan lanterns. It is a unique identifying feature. Removing or changing it would alter the object’s identity. This is a 3-point element due to its symbolic and structural uniqueness.",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the domed finial with a tiered shape and a small loop at the very top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The internal illumination producing a warm glow is essential to the lantern’s function and visual impact. Even when enclosed in a dome, the light must originate from within the lantern to preserve its purpose. This is a 2-point element because it’s crucial for functionality and atmosphere, though less about identity than structure.",
      "question": "Does the edited image show the lantern emitting a warm, internal glow from within the glass body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The overall silhouette—bulbous glass body atop a flared metal base with a conical cap—is the fundamental shape of the lantern. This form is necessary for recognition. Changing proportions or adding elements that obscure this shape would compromise identity. This is a 2-point element because it supports structural recognition.",
      "question": "Does the edited image preserve the overall silhouette of the lantern as a bulbous glass body on a flared metal base topped with a conical finial?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The presence of geometric Islamic design motifs in the surrounding environment (originally in the wall and table) reflects the cultural context. Although the tiles are converted into streets, the same design language should persist. Retaining this ensures visual coherence and cultural authenticity. This is a 2-point element because it maintains thematic consistency.",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain geometric Islamic design motifs (such as stars, diamonds, or interlocking patterns) in the surrounding environment, even if scaled down or adapted into streets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
