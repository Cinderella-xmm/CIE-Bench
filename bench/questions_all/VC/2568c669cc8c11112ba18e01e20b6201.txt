**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a classical portrait depicting a woman and a young child in an intimate embrace. The woman, seated, has curly dark hair adorned with a red headband and wears a white neoclassical-style dress with a draped red sash across her torso and a greenish-gold fabric draped over her lap. Her expression is serene, and she gazes directly at the viewer. The child, positioned slightly behind and to her right, wraps her arms around the woman’s neck; she has long, wavy dark hair and wears a blue dress with short sleeves. The lighting is soft and directional from the upper left, casting gentle shadows and highlighting the figures’ faces and limbs. The background is a plain, muted brown-gray gradient, devoid of any distinct objects or scenery, emphasizing the emotional intimacy between the two figures. The overall composition conveys warmth, tenderness, and maternal affection through subtle body language and delicate rendering of skin tones and drapery.

**Thinking process:**  
First, analyze the editing instructions word by word to determine what elements are explicitly permitted to change:

- "Design a digital character card styled like an RPG collectible" → This indicates the **overall format and presentation** of the image will be transformed into a collectible card layout. Therefore, the **frame, border, text overlays, stat bars, banners, nameplate**, and **backdrop texture** (parchment) are new additions and **not part of the original visual content**, so they can be changed.
- "Portraying the mother and child as 'The Bonded Souls'" → This is a **narrative rebranding**, not a physical transformation of the subjects themselves. The identities of the figures remain the same — mother and child — but their symbolic role is being altered. However, **their forms, poses, and appearances must remain consistent** unless otherwise stated.
- "Use a painterly, neoclassical art style preserving the gentle embrace and warm color palette" → This specifies that the **artistic style and emotional tone** should be preserved, including:
  - The **gentle embrace** (posture),
  - The **warm color palette** (skin tones, clothing colors: red, white, blue, green),
  - The **painterly quality** (brushwork, light modeling).
  → These are **to be retained**, even if stylized within a new format.
- "Add stat bars: [Empathy +10], [Protection +9], [Grace +8], [Healing +10]" → These are **new graphical elements** not present in the original, so they are **allowed to be added**.
- "Include a ribbon-textured title banner above and a golden nameplate below" → These are **decorative textual elements** to be added, not part of the original image.
- "Frame the card with ornate filigree" → This is a **new frame design**, so allowed to be changed.
- "Use a soft parchment backdrop to evoke timeless affection" → This replaces the original plain background. So the **background texture and color** are **allowed to change**.

Thus, the following are **explicitly allowed to change**:

- Background (replaced with parchment texture)
- Frame/border (added ornate filigree)
- Textual elements (title banner, nameplate, stat bars)
- Overall layout (transformed into an RPG card)

However, the **core visual content** — the **mother and child**, their **poses**, **facial expressions**, **clothing details**, **color scheme**, and **lighting** — must remain **visually consistent** because the instruction says “preserving the gentle embrace and warm color palette.” Also, the **identity of the figures** (woman and child) and their **relationship** (embrace) must be maintained.

**Allowed Changes List:**
- Background texture and color (from plain brown-gray to parchment-like)
- Addition of ornate filigree border
- Addition of ribbon-textured title banner
- Addition of golden nameplate
- Addition of stat bars
- Layout transformation into RPG collectible card format

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
Now, identify what **must be preserved** based on the original image and the constraints of the editing instructions.

**Core recognition elements:**  
This painting is a known work by Jacques-Louis David, titled *"Madame Récamier and Her Daughter"* (or similar), though not universally identified as such, its **distinctive features** include:
- The **woman’s red headband** — a prominent accessory that defines her appearance.
- The **child’s blue dress** — a key identifying feature of the child.
- The **white dress with red sash** worn by the mother — this specific combination of garments is iconic in the composition.
- The **intimate embrace** — the **physical positioning**: child’s arms around the mother’s neck, mother’s arms wrapped around the child’s back — this is central to the emotional narrative.
- The **curly dark hair** of both figures — a defining trait.
- The **direct gaze of the mother** toward the viewer — this is a key compositional choice.
- The **soft chiaroscuro lighting** from the upper left — essential for mood and form.
- The **draped greenish-gold fabric** over the mother’s lap — this adds depth and richness to the scene.

These are **core identity features** because they distinguish this specific painting from others. Changing them would make the image unrecognizable as the original artwork.

**Functional/logical association elements:**  
- The **embrace** is not just aesthetic but functional in conveying emotional bond. If the arms are moved or removed, the meaning is lost. Thus, the **arm positions** must be preserved.
- The **relative positions** of the figures (child behind, mother seated) must remain unchanged to maintain spatial logic.
- The **direction of gaze** (mother looking forward, child looking slightly upward) maintains narrative tension and connection.

**Non-modified element deduction:**  
After excluding the allowed changes (background, frame, text), all remaining **visual details** of the figures must be retained:
- Clothing textures (e.g., folds in the white dress, fringes on the red sash)
- Skin tones and facial features
- Hair texture and volume
- Lighting gradients on skin and fabric
- Color accuracy (especially red, white, blue, gold)

Even minor details like the **fringe pattern on the red sash** or the **texture of the blue dress** contribute to visual authenticity and must be preserved.

**Preservation Targets List:**
- The woman’s red headband
- The child’s blue dress
- The mother’s white dress with red sash
- The greenish-gold draped fabric over the mother’s lap
- The intimate embrace posture (child’s arms around mother’s neck, mother’s arms around child)
- The mother’s direct gaze toward the viewer
- The child’s upward gaze toward the mother
- The curly dark hair of both figures
- The soft lighting from the upper left
- The skin tones and facial features of both figures
- The texture and folds of the clothing
- The red sash’s fringe detail

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

Q1:  
Thinking process: The red headband is a distinctive and iconic feature of the mother's appearance in the original painting. It is a core recognition element that identifies her character and distinguishes her from other figures. Its presence and position on the forehead are crucial for maintaining the visual identity of the subject. Losing it would alter the figure's recognizability, especially in a historical context. Therefore, this is a high-weight element.
Question: Is the red headband visible on the mother’s head, positioned across her forehead?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The child’s blue dress is a key identifier of her character and contrasts with the mother’s white dress. Its color and sleeve length are unique and essential for distinguishing the child from the mother. Changing it would disrupt the visual hierarchy and thematic contrast in the composition. This is a critical element for identity and balance.
Question: Does the child wear a blue dress with short sleeves?
Choices: Yes, No
