### Step 1 - Analyzing Allowed Changes and Determining Reference Image Details

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject consists of a bright lime-green soccer cleat and a matching lime-green tennis ball placed on a neutral gray background. The cleat has a textured surface, a tied shoelace, and visible studs on the sole. The tennis ball exhibits a fuzzy texture and a distinct white seam. Both items share a vibrant lime-green color.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instructions specify transforming the soccer cleat and tennis ball into chibi-style Russian nesting dolls while retaining their vibrant lime-green color and texture. The scene is to be changed to a wooden table with a subtle background. The number of nesting dolls, their arrangement, and the new setting are explicitly defined.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
1. The soccer cleat and tennis ball are transformed into chibi-style Russian nesting dolls.  
2. The scene changes to a wooden table with a subtle background.  
3. The number of nesting dolls is set to five, arranged from largest to smallest.  
4. Aspect ratio is adjusted to 3:2 horizontal.  

### Step 2 - Determining Elements That Should Remain Unchanged

**Thinking process:**  
Core recognition elements include the vibrant lime-green color and texture of the cleat and ball, as these are central to the design of the nesting dolls. Functional/logical associations involve maintaining the visual connection between the original objects and the new form. Remaining elements like the specific texture and color must be retained for visual coherence.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
1. Vibrant lime-green color of the cleat and ball.  
2. Textured surface of the cleat and fuzzy texture of the ball.  
3. White seam on the tennis ball.  
4. General shape cues of the cleat and ball (e.g., roundedness of the ball, elongated form of the cleat).  

### Step 3 - Generating Yes/No Questions

**Q1:**  
Thinking process: The vibrant lime-green color is a core recognition feature. Losing this would make the nesting dolls unidentifiable as inspired by the original objects.  
Question: Does the image retain the vibrant lime-green color for the nesting dolls?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

**Q2:**  
Thinking process: The textured surface of the cleat is a key detail that distinguishes it from other objects. Retaining this texture ensures the nesting doll maintains its identity.  
Question: Do the nesting dolls retain the textured surface resembling the cleat's material?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

**Q3:**  
Thinking process: The fuzzy texture and white seam on the tennis ball are iconic features that must be preserved for recognition.  
Question: Do the nesting dolls incorporate the fuzzy texture and white seam of the tennis ball?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

**Q4:**  
Thinking process: The general shape of the cleat (elongated form) is an important visual cue.  
Question: Do the nesting dolls reflect the elongated shape of the soccer cleat?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

**Q5:**  
Thinking process: The rounded shape of the tennis ball is another critical visual cue.  
Question: Do the nesting dolls incorporate the rounded shape of the tennis ball?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2
