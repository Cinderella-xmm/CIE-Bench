      "thinking_process": "The curled trunk is a core identity feature of this specific elephant sculpture. Its shape and position are distinctive and contribute to the sculpture's serene expression. If lost or straightened, the sculpture would lose its characteristic pose and emotional tone. This is a key identifying feature, making it a 3-point element.",
      "question": "Is the trunk curled upward at the tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The long, curved tusks are essential to the elephant’s identity. Their length and symmetry are visually dominant and help distinguish this sculpture from others. Removing or shortening them would fundamentally alter the subject’s appearance and make it unrecognizable as the original piece.",
      "question": "Are both tusks present and curved outward in a symmetrical fashion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The ornate headdress is a signature feature of the sculpture, indicating cultural significance and artistic intent. It is intricately designed and covers the top of the head. Its absence would remove a major identifying element, especially given its prominence in the original image.",
      "question": "Is the headdress with detailed carvings covering the top of the elephant’s head present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The ankle bands are small but consistent details across all four legs. They are part of the ceremonial design and add authenticity to the sculpture. Their removal would diminish the cultural accuracy and visual completeness of the piece.",
      "question": "Are there decorative bands around each of the elephant’s four ankles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The carved patterns on the body, especially the floral and geometric designs on the side and back, are central to the sculpture’s artistic identity. These patterns are not just decoration—they define the work’s style. Even if golden inlays are added, the underlying carved texture must remain visible and consistent.",
      "question": "Are intricate floral and geometric carvings visible on the side and back of the elephant’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The profile orientation (facing right) is a fixed compositional choice in the original image. Changing the direction would alter the viewer’s perception and break continuity. Since the instruction does not specify rotation, this orientation must be preserved.",
      "question": "Is the elephant facing to the right side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The neck adornment, resembling layered chains or fringes, is a key accessory that adds depth and cultural richness. Its presence distinguishes this sculpture from generic elephant depictions. Even with added gold, the original form must remain.",
      "question": "Is there a decorative necklace or fringe-like adornment around the elephant’s neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "thinking_process": "The feet have distinct, rounded toe pads that are part of the realistic yet stylized rendering. These are minor but contribute to the overall anatomical accuracy and craftsmanship. Their loss would reduce detail fidelity.",
      "question": "Do the feet show individual toe pads with rounded shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
