      "thinking_process": "The seam details are explicitly instructed to be retained as embossed linear patterns. These seams define the structural segmentation of the suitcase, including the contour of the front pocket, the vertical division between panels, and the edge outlines. Their geometric layout is a core visual identifier of the suitcase's design language. If lost, the transformed object would lack the original’s structural character, making it unrecognizable as derived from the original. Hence, the presence and alignment of the seam lines are critical.",
      "question": "Are the original seam lines (including those around the front pocket and vertical panel divisions) preserved as embossed linear patterns on the transformed glass vessel?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The logo is a key brand identifier. Although the instruction says to \"add an elegant logo etched near the top,\" it implies the original logo’s identity and position should be maintained. The original logo is located near the top center of the front panel. Changing its position or omitting it entirely would break brand continuity and visual coherence. Therefore, the logo must appear in approximately the same location, even if transformed.",
      "question": "Is the brand logo positioned near the top center of the front face of the transformed object?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The retractable handle is repurposed as a spray nozzle, but its function and spatial role suggest it must remain at the top center of the object. The original handle is vertically aligned and centrally placed. Removing or relocating it would disrupt the logical transformation from luggage to perfume bottle, where the nozzle must be at the top. Thus, the handle’s position and vertical orientation must be preserved.",
      "question": "Is the metallic spray nozzle located at the top center of the object, aligned vertically with the original handle’s position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The original suitcase has four spinner wheels at the base corners. The instruction states to convert them into decorative caps, implying their number and placement must be preserved for structural balance. Losing one or altering their position would break symmetry and visual consistency with the original object’s footprint. Thus, the count and corner-based positioning are essential.",
      "question": "Are four decorative caps present at the base corners of the transformed object, corresponding to the original wheel positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The front pocket is defined by two parallel zipper tracks and a distinct rectangular outline formed by seams. While the material changes, the instruction to retain seam details implies the pocket’s outline and zipper paths must be preserved in form. The dual-zipper configuration is a unique detail of the original design, contributing to its identity. Omitting or altering it would reduce fidelity.",
      "question": "Are the two zipper tracks of the front pocket preserved as linear features on the transformed object, maintaining their parallel alignment and position within the front panel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The side handle is a functional feature located on the right side of the suitcase. While not explicitly mentioned in the transformation, its presence contributes to the object’s symmetry and usability. Since the wheels are being preserved in position, and the handle is part of the lateral profile, it is reasonable to assume it is either transformed or retained in place. However, the instruction does not mention it, so its retention is not mandatory. But given the emphasis on symmetry and structural balance, its absence would create imbalance. Thus, it is a minor but important detail.",
      "question": "Is a handle present on the right side of the transformed object, corresponding to the original side handle’s position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
