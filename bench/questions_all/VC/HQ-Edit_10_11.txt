**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a large silverback gorilla seated in a contemplative pose on a moss-covered log within a dense, misty tropical rainforest. The gorilla faces slightly toward the viewer’s right, with its left hand resting under its chin in a thoughtful gesture. Its fur is predominantly dark gray with a silvery-white saddle across the back and shoulders, characteristic of a dominant male. The facial features are highly detailed: deep-set greenish eyes, pronounced brow ridges, a broad nose, and a defined jawline. The texture of the fur is thick and layered, with individual strands visible in areas of light exposure. The gorilla's posture is relaxed yet alert, with one leg bent and the other tucked beneath, and its large hands show distinct knuckles and nails.  

The background consists of tall, slender trees draped in moss and vines, with dappled sunlight filtering through the canopy. Lush ferns and broad-leafed plants surround the log, and the forest floor is littered with fallen leaves and damp earth. A prominent tree branch covered in vibrant green moss extends diagonally from the upper left corner into the frame. The overall lighting is soft and diffused, creating an ethereal atmosphere.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction explicitly states:  
- "Transform the gorilla into a wood-carved sculpture" → This indicates a **complete transformation of the subject’s physical form**, from living animal to carved object. Therefore, **the biological form, skin, fur, musculature, and organic textures of the gorilla can be altered or replaced**.  
- "Using varying shades of brown to define body contours" → Color palette of the subject is now restricted to brown tones; original fur colors (gray, silver) may be removed.  
- "Engrave detailed fur textures" → While the *appearance* of fur must be preserved via engraving, it is no longer real fur but a **stylized representation**. Thus, the **texture style** changes, but the **presence and pattern** of fur must still reflect the original.  
- "Smooth out the arms and legs" → Implies that anatomical joints and muscular definition may be simplified or idealized, so **proportions and limb shapes can be modified**.  
- "Simplify the leafy backdrop to an etched wooden surface with a few scattered leaves in darker wood tones" → The **background environment is being replaced entirely**, meaning the **realistic forest scene is not required to remain**. Only the **essence of the forest**—represented through etched patterns and symbolic leaves—is to be preserved.

Thus, the **allowed changes** include:
- Subject form: From live gorilla to wood-carved sculpture
- Subject color: From natural fur tones to various shades of brown
- Subject texture: From realistic fur to engraved lines simulating fur
- Limb proportions: Arms and legs can be smoothed and stylized
- Background: Realistic forest replaced with etched wooden surface
- Lighting and atmosphere: Can shift from natural misty light to flat or directional carving-style illumination

**Allowed Changes List:**  
- The biological appearance of the gorilla (skin, flesh, muscle tone)  
- The original fur color (gray/silver)  
- The exact anatomical details of limbs (joints, knuckles, feet)  
- The realistic texture of fur (individual strands, volume)  
- The full forest environment (trees, moss, foliage, depth)  
- The lighting and atmospheric effects (mist, dappled light)  
- The position and shape of the log (though it may remain as a base)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
Despite the extensive transformation, certain **core recognition elements** must be retained to preserve the identity of the subject and maintain logical coherence:

1. **Core Recognition Elements:**  
   - The **overall silhouette and posture** of the gorilla must remain recognizable — specifically, the **seated pose with left hand under chin**. This is a defining visual cue that establishes the subject’s identity and intent (contemplation). If this pose is lost, the figure may no longer be identifiable as the same subject.  
   - The **distinctive head shape and facial structure** — including the **prominent brow ridge, wide nose, and strong jawline** — are essential for identifying the subject as a gorilla, especially a silverback. These are non-negotiable traits in primate taxonomy and visual recognition.  
   - The **presence of the silver saddle** (a hallmark of adult male gorillas) must be represented in some form — even if rendered in brown tones, its **location and shape** should be preserved to maintain species accuracy.

2. **Functional/Logical Association Elements:**  
   - The **position of the gorilla on a log** must be maintained. Even if the log becomes part of the wooden surface, the **subject must remain seated on a raised horizontal platform**, preserving the spatial logic of the original composition.  
   - The **hand-under-chin gesture** is a key functional element indicating thoughtfulness. It conveys intentionality and character, so its **pose and placement** must be preserved to retain narrative consistency.

3. **Non-Modified Element Deduction:**  
   After excluding allowed changes, the following must remain:
   - The **general body orientation** (facing slightly right)
   - The **relative size and proportion** between head and body
   - The **presence of the right arm resting on the knee**
   - The **shape and direction of the gaze** (forward and slightly downward)
   - The **moss-covered surface** is mentioned in the original, and while it is transformed, the **concept of a natural surface supporting the figure** must remain — thus, the **base material should resemble a natural support**, even if stylized.

Additionally, the **instruction requires retaining the forest essence**, so although the background is simplified, **some representation of foliage** must exist — such as **etched leaf shapes** — to maintain thematic continuity.

---

**Preservation Targets List:**  
- The seated pose with left hand under chin  
- The facial structure: prominent brow ridge, wide nose, strong jawline  
- The presence and location of the silver saddle (even if rendered in brown)  
- The position of the gorilla on a horizontal platform (log/base)  
- The right arm resting on the knee  
- The general body orientation (slightly facing right)  
- The gaze direction (forward and downward)  
- The concept of foliage in the background (via etched leaves)

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The seated pose with the left hand under the chin is the most iconic and distinguishing feature of the subject in the original image. It defines the contemplative mood and serves as a core visual anchor. Losing this gesture would fundamentally alter the subject’s identity and emotional expression, making it unrecognizable as the same figure. Therefore, this is a critical identification element with a weight of 3 points.
    Question: Is the gorilla depicted in a seated pose with its left hand resting under its chin?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The facial structure, particularly the prominent brow ridge, wide nose, and strong jawline, are essential for identifying the subject as a silverback gorilla. These features distinguish it from other primates and are biologically accurate markers. Altering them would result in misidentification. Hence, they are core recognition elements with a weight of 3 points.
    Question: Does the gorilla have a prominent brow ridge, wide nose, and strong jawline consistent with a silverback gorilla?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The silver saddle — the patch of lighter fur across the back and shoulders — is a defining trait of mature male gorillas. Even though the instruction allows changing color to brown, the **shape and location** of this feature must be preserved to maintain species accuracy. Its absence would make the figure appear juvenile or incorrect. Thus, this is a key biological identifier with a weight of 3 points.
    Question: Is there a distinct patch resembling a silver saddle located across the back and shoulders of the gorilla?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The position of the gorilla on a horizontal platform (the log) is crucial for maintaining spatial logic and compositional balance. Even if the log is transformed into a wooden surface, the subject must remain seated on a raised, horizontal base to preserve the original scene's grounding. Removing this would disrupt the environmental relationship and make the figure appear floating. This is an important structural element with a weight of 2 points.
    Question: Is the gorilla positioned on a horizontal surface that resembles a log or platform?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The right arm resting on the knee is a secondary but significant detail that contributes to the overall posture and balance of the figure. It helps define the seated position and adds realism. While less critical than the hand-under-chin gesture, its absence would affect the naturalness of the pose. It is a minor but coherent detail, hence assigned 1 point.
    Question: Is the gorilla’s right arm resting on its right knee?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The direction of the gaze — forward and slightly downward — is a subtle but important cue for conveying contemplation. It aligns with the hand-under-chin pose and contributes to the emotional tone. Changing this would alter the intended mood. Although not a primary identifier, it supports narrative consistency and is therefore a key detail worth 2 points.
    Question: Is the gorilla’s gaze directed forward and slightly downward?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The instruction specifies simplifying the background to an etched wooden surface with scattered leaves. However, the **presence of leaf-like forms** is required to capture the forest essence. These must be present in the background, even if stylized, to fulfill the directive. Their absence would violate the instruction and lose thematic context. Thus, this is a necessary scene element with a weight of 2 points.
    Question: Are there leaf-shaped elements present in the background, even if stylized or etched?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
