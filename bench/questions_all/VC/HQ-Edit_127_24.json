Even if transformed into ice castles, the **number and general layout** of the buildings must be preserved to maintain scene recognition. The **two-building configuration** is a defining structural element. If only one building remains or their positions are swapped, the scene becomes unrecognizable. Thus, this is a high-weight question.",

      "thinking_process": "The **chimneys emitting smoke** are a key narrative and atmospheric detail, suggesting warmth and life within the otherwise cold environment. Smoke is a dynamic visual cue tied to the functional use of the chalets. Even if transformed into icy structures, the **presence of at least one visible smoke plume** from a chimney-like feature should be retained to preserve the original scene’s emotional tone and logic. Its absence would remove a critical signifier of human presence.",

      "thinking_process": "The **glowing windows** are a signature contrast in the image—warm light against cold snow. They define the interior life of the chalets and are essential to the mood. Even if the buildings become ice castles, **illuminated openings** should remain to reflect this core visual theme. The **number and pattern** of lit windows (especially the grid-like arrangement) are distinctive. Losing them would erase the emotional core of the scene.",

Their **conical shape and snow-laden branches** are characteristic of alpine winter forests. Even if transformed into ice sculptures, the **presence of tall, slender evergreens** in the same location must be preserved to maintain spatial coherence.

Its **silhouette and height relative to the chalets** provide scale and grandeur. Even if stylized, the **presence of a prominent, snow-covered mountain peak** in the distance must be retained to preserve the geographical setting.
