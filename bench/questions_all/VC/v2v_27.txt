### Description of Reference Image:
The subject is a cartoon bear sitting on a turquoise chair, wearing a straw hat and a green Hawaiian shirt with orange polka dots. The bear has a relaxed posture, holding a pineapple-shaped drink with a small umbrella. The background features tropical elements like a large orange hibiscus flower and green palm fronds. The overall color palette is warm and vibrant, evoking a tropical vacation vibe.

### Thinking Process:
The instructions specify transforming the bear into a chibi-style character with six distinct poses. While the form and pose of the bear can change, certain elements like the chibi design style, the fun Hawaiian shirt and straw hat, and the tropical background elements must be retained. The sitting posture reminiscent of the original image should also be preserved where applicable.

### Allowed Changes List:
- The bear's form can be transformed into a chibi style.
- The bear's poses can be changed to match the six specified scenarios.
- The background can be simplified to bright tropical tones with decorative elements like hibiscus flowers, palm fronds, or fruity drinks.
- The dimension ratio can be adjusted to 9:16.

### Thinking Process:
Core recognition elements include the bear's species-specific features (like its snout and ears), the iconic Hawaiian shirt and straw hat, and the tropical setting. Functional/logical elements include the bear's interaction with the drink and chair, which should be logically consistent with the new poses. Remaining elements like the bear's relaxed demeanor and the vibrant color palette should be retained for visual coherence.

### Preservation Targets List:
- The bear's species-specific features (snout, ears).
- The Hawaiian shirt and straw hat.
- The tropical background elements (hibiscus flower, palm fronds).
- The bear's interaction with objects (drink, chair).
- The vibrant color palette.
