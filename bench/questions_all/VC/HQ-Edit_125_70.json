      "thinking_process": "The chisel with a long straight steel shaft and wooden handle is a distinctive tool whose shape is critical to identifying the workshop environment. Its elongated metallic blade and cylindrical wooden grip are unique identifiers among the tools. If this specific form is altered or removed, the authenticity of the carpentry setting is compromised. Therefore, its retention is essential for maintaining the core identity of the scene.",
      "question": "Is the chisel with a long straight steel shaft and wooden handle still present in the same shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The gouge with a curved cutting edge and oval wooden handle is another iconic woodworking tool. Its concave blade distinguishes it from other chisels and is a key visual marker of fine carpentry. Removing or altering its shape would misrepresent the craft context. Thus, preserving its form is vital for accurate identification.",
      "question": "Is the gouge with a curved cutting edge and oval wooden handle still present in the same shape and position?",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The hammer's combination of a smooth wooden handle and a black metal head with a clawed end is its defining feature. Even though a logo may be added, the underlying structure—especially the claw and head shape—must remain unchanged to preserve its identity as a claw hammer. Altering this would make it unrecognizable as such.",
      "question": "Does the hammer retain its original shape, including the clawed end and black metal head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The spiral shape of the wood shavings is a direct result of hand-tool use and contributes to the narrative of active craftsmanship. Their curled form is a signature detail of woodturning or carving. Replacing them with flat fragments or altering their shape would remove this key evidence of process, undermining the scene’s authenticity.",
      "question": "Are the wood shavings still in their original spiral curled form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The wooden workbench has a distinct grain pattern and visible wear marks, which establish its age and use. These textures are essential to the rustic aesthetic and must be preserved even if overlaid with text or graphics. Losing these details would make the surface appear artificial or modernized.",
      "question": "Is the natural wood grain and worn texture of the workbench still visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The pegboard’s dark gray color and uniform perforation pattern are foundational to the workshop backdrop. While the instruction allows changing it to grayscale with copper accents, the grid of holes and its layout must remain intact to maintain the functional tool storage system. Disrupting this would break the logical structure of the scene.",
      "question": "Is the perforated pegboard with evenly spaced holes still present in the same layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The diagonal placement of the hammer across the bench creates a strong compositional line and implies recent use. This positioning is crucial for storytelling and visual balance. Moving it to a vertical or horizontal orientation would disrupt the intended narrative flow and visual dynamics.",
      "question": "Is the hammer positioned diagonally across the workbench?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The small wooden box filled with shavings is a secondary but consistent detail that reinforces the idea of ongoing work. Its presence adds depth to the scene and provides contextual continuity. Removing it would reduce environmental richness and coherence.",
      "question": "Is the small wooden box containing wood shavings still present on the right side of the bench?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
