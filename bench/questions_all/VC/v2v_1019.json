      "thinking_process": "The cylindrical shape and reddish-brown color of the hot dogs are core identity features. These characteristics are essential for recognizing the subject as a hot dog. Even in a stylized chibi form, the character’s body must maintain this shape and color to preserve the original subject’s identity. Losing these would make the character unrecognizable as a hot dog, which is central to the concept. Therefore, this element is critical and assigned a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Does the character’s body retain the cylindrical shape and reddish-brown color of the original hot dogs?",

      "thinking_process": "The coleslaw’s texture—specifically the combination of white cabbage, orange carrot, and purple cabbage shreds—is a unique visual identifier. This mix of colors and textures defines the coleslaw and must be preserved in the character’s hair to maintain the connection to the original image. If these elements are omitted or replaced, the character loses its thematic link to coleslaw. This is a key feature but not as fundamental as the hot dog shape, so it is assigned a weight of 2 points.",
      "question": "Does the character’s hair incorporate the shredded texture of white, orange, and purple cabbage from the original coleslaw?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The plate’s decorative border with its specific pattern of teal blue, burnt orange, and dark brown floral and scroll motifs is a distinctive visual element. The instruction requires a \"faux vintage plate design that matches the one in the image,\" meaning this pattern must be preserved in the base. Altering or omitting this pattern would break the visual continuity and fail to meet the instruction’s requirement. This is a core scene element and thus assigned a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the decorative border of the plate, featuring teal blue, burnt orange, and dark brown floral and scroll motifs, present in the base design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The association between the hot dogs and the plate is a functional/logical element. The character must be placed on a base derived from the plate to maintain the scene’s coherence. This ensures the character remains connected to the original context. While the exact positioning may vary, the relationship must be preserved. This is important for scene consistency and is assigned a weight of 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the character positioned on a base that visually derives from the original plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The presence of two hot dogs is implied by the original image and the instruction’s mention of a dual-character structure. Even if stylized, the character must reflect the duality of the original hot dogs. This detail supports the overall composition and maintains fidelity to the source. It is a secondary but meaningful detail, so it is assigned a weight of 1 point.",
      "question": "Does the character represent two hot dogs, either through dual bodies or mirrored features?",
