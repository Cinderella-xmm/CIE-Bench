      "thinking_process": "The dragon engravings are the central artistic and symbolic feature of the teapot. Their presence, detailed scales, coiled posture, and interaction with cloud motifs are critical for identifying the object as derived from the original. If these are absent or replaced with generic patterns, the core identity is lost. Thus, preserving the specific form and relief of the dragons is essential.",
      "question": "Are the embossed dragons with detailed scales, claws, and flowing bodies clearly visible on the body of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The embossed texture of the metal surface is a defining characteristic of the original teapot. It distinguishes it from flat or painted designs and conveys craftsmanship. If the surface becomes smooth or printed, the tactile and visual authenticity is compromised. Since the instruction says \"maintaining the dragon engravings,\" this implies preservation of the raised relief technique.",
      "question": "Is the surface of the object textured with raised relief patterns, particularly around the dragon motifs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The spout is a functional and structural component of the teapot. Its shape, especially the dragon-head-like curve, is distinctive. Even if repurposed for branding, its physical presence and general form must be retained to maintain logical continuity between the original and transformed object. Removing or drastically altering it would break the functional analogy.",
      "question": "Is there a distinct spout extending from the side of the object, shaped like a dragon's head with an open mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The metallic silver appearance with reflective shine is a core visual trait of the original teapot. Changing the color or finish (e.g., to matte black or gold) would alter the perceived luxury and heritage. The instruction mentions \"metallic\" for the new cap, implying the material tone should be consistent. Thus, the silver hue and reflective quality must be preserved.",
      "question": "Does the object retain a silver-colored, highly reflective metallic surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The object’s upright orientation on a flat surface is a stable compositional element in the original image. It ensures visual coherence and grounding. While the background can change, the object’s position relative to the surface must remain consistent to preserve spatial logic. If it floats or tilts unnaturally, the scene becomes inconsistent.",
      "question": "Is the object positioned upright on a flat surface, such as a wooden table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
