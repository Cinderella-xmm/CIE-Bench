Description of reference image: The subject is an elephant carrying two people on its back via a saddle-like seating arrangement. One person is seated directly above the elephant with a blue outfit and a wide-brimmed hat, while the second person sits behind them. The elephant is walking on a dirt path surrounded by lush green vegetation. The path appears natural and uneven, with trees and leaves on either side.

**Thinking process:**

### Allowed Changes List:

1. **Subject Transformation**: The cow in the instructions can be interpreted as the elephant in this image, which will be transformed into an anthropomorphic medieval knight-themed bull.
2. **Clothing and Accessories**: The clothing of the transformed subject will be changed to silver metal armor and a cape.
3. **Facial Expression**: The transformed subject will be given a determined expression.
4. **Background Replacement**: The background will be replaced with a medieval forest path with sunlight filtering through the trees.
5. **Artistic Style**: The entire image will be converted into a realistic oil painting style.

### Preservation Targets List:

#### Core Recognition Elements:

1. **Posture of the Subject**: Despite transforming the elephant into a bull, its rightward walking motion should be maintained.
2. **Saddle and Seating Arrangement**: The way the people are seated, including the style of the seating structure, must be retained for functional consistency as the bull carries the riders.

#### Functional/Logical Association Elements:

3. **Relative Position Between Riders and Subject**: People must still be seated on top of the anthropomorphic bull, maintaining the same relative height and spatial relationship.

#### Remaining Elements Based on Visual Coherence:

4. **Dirt Path Texture**: The ground characteristics should stay consistent with a natural, uneven path.
5. **Surrounding Greenery Composition**: While the background will change, some level of natural foliage framing the path should persist.
