      "thinking_process": "The clear helmet visor revealing the astronaut’s face is a core identification feature. Without it, the subject would lose its human identity and become unrecognizable as a person in a spacesuit. The visibility of facial features like eyes, nose, and hair is essential for maintaining the original subject’s identity. If the visor is obscured or removed, the character becomes anonymous, violating the identity preservation principle. This is a 3-point element because it directly enables recognition of the subject as a specific individual in a space suit.",

      "thinking_process": "The American flag patch is a key symbolic element identifying the astronaut’s nationality and mission context. Its presence and position on the left shoulder are standard in NASA imagery and serve as a strong visual anchor. Changing its location, removing it, or altering its colors would break the connection to real-world space exploration history. It is a 3-point element due to its iconic status and role in establishing the subject’s identity within the context of U.S. space missions.",
      "question": "Is there a red, white, and blue American flag patch located on the left shoulder of the suit?",

      "thinking_process": "The backpack is a functional component of the spacesuit, providing life support. Its presence and attachment to the back are critical for maintaining the logical coherence of the astronaut’s equipment. Removing or altering its shape would make the suit non-functional and disrupt the realism of the scene. While the design can be stylized, its existence and position must be preserved. This is a 2-point element because it supports the functionality and plausibility of the astronaut’s gear.",
      "question": "Is there a large, boxy life-support pack attached to the astronaut’s back?",

      "thinking_process": "The segmented structure of the suit, particularly at the joints (elbows, knees), is essential for indicating mobility and the engineering of a real spacesuit. These details distinguish it from generic clothing or fantasy armor. Altering or smoothing out these segments would make the suit appear unrealistic or misidentified. This is a 2-point element because it maintains the technical authenticity of the suit’s design.",

      "thinking_process": "The boot interacting with the lunar surface and displacing dust is a key detail indicating movement and physical interaction with the environment. This dynamic element grounds the astronaut in the lunar setting and adds realism. Even if the surface is stylized, the boot’s contact with the ground and resulting dust trail must be preserved to maintain environmental logic. This is a 1-point element because it is a minor but coherent detail supporting the scene’s realism.",

Its presence is crucial for situating the astronaut in a recognizable astronomical setting. While its size or brightness may change, its existence as a bright sphere in the sky must be retained. This is a 2-point element because it provides essential environmental context.",

A non-circular or opaque helmet would fail to represent a traditional astronaut helmet. This shape is iconic and necessary for visual recognition. While internal reflections may change, the outer form must remain circular. This is a 2-point element because it defines the helmet’s identity.",
