Description of reference image: The subject is a multi-story brick residential building in a European urban setting, likely Amsterdam, characterized by its red-brown brick facade with horizontal orange-brown stripes. The building features numerous white-framed windows arranged symmetrically across multiple floors, some with arched tops and others rectangular. Several balconies are present, each with ornate black metal railings, and some have potted plants or small garden elements. Green ivy climbs vertically along the central portion of the facade, covering parts of the windows and balconies. The ground floor includes two entrances—one with a red wooden door and another with a dark gray door—both framed by stone arches. A blue compact car and a silver van are parked in front of the building on the street. A red rectangle highlights a section of the facade containing three stacked windows and an adjacent balcony. Trees with green leaves partially frame the top left corner of the image. The sky is clear and light blue, indicating daytime.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions that clearly state what can be changed: "Transform the building's facade into an oversized LEGO structure." This indicates the entire architectural form and material texture of the building can be altered to resemble LEGO bricks. "Use contrasting brick colors, with muted reds and muted blues" — this allows for color modification of the facade, replacing original brick tones with LEGO-like hues. "Replace the climbing plants with green LEGO vines" — confirms that the ivy must be replaced, so it is not a retention target. "Ensure balconies are distinctive, with gray LEGO railings" — implies that while balcony presence is preserved, their material and design are to be modified, hence not fully retained. "Place this LEGO building on a simple platform to highlight its blocky aesthetic" — means the base/platform and overall presentation context may change, so the street-level environment (cars, pavement) may no longer be required. However, since the instruction does not specify changing or removing the **position** or **structure** of key architectural components like window placement, door locations, or the general layout of the building, these underlying spatial relationships must be preserved to maintain structural fidelity.

Allowed Changes List:
- Building facade material and texture (to LEGO blocks)
- Color of bricks (to muted reds and blues)
- Climbing plants (replaced with green LEGO vines)
- Balcony railings (replaced with gray LEGO-style railings)
- Ground level and surrounding environment (replaced with a simple platform)
- Overall scale and aesthetic (transformed into blocky LEGO style)

Step 2- Determine the elements that should remain unchanged  
Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements: The identity of the building as a specific Dutch-style urban residence hinges on its architectural layout—especially the arrangement of windows, doors, and balconies. Even if made of LEGO, the **spatial configuration** of these features must remain consistent to preserve the building’s recognizability. For example, the vertical alignment of windows, the presence of two ground-floor entrances (one red, one dark), and the pattern of balconies at specific floor levels are iconic identifiers of such Amsterdam buildings. These cannot be arbitrarily rearranged without losing identity.

Functional/logical association elements: The **relative positions** of windows, doors, and balconies define the building’s function and logic. If a balcony appears above a non-existent window or a door is moved to a different side, the internal logic of the building’s use breaks down. Therefore, the **layout and alignment** of openings and access points must be preserved.

Non-modified element deduction: After excluding allowed changes (material, color, plant type, railing design), the remaining unmentioned but visually distinct features include:
- The **number and position** of windows per floor
- The **placement of the two ground-floor doors**
- The **presence and location of the red rectangle highlighting a specific section**
- The **overall symmetry and rhythm** of the façade
- The **existence of the ivy-covered vertical strip**, though its material will change, its **location and path** must remain

Preservation Targets List:  
- The number and vertical alignment of windows on each floor  
- The location and shape of the two ground-floor entrances (red door and dark door)  
- The position and orientation of the balconies relative to their respective windows  
- The presence and path of the climbing ivy along the central part of the facade (though material changes)  
- The red rectangular outline marking a specific section of the facade

    Q1:  
    Thinking process: The vertical alignment of windows across the floors is a core architectural feature of this Amsterdam-style building. Its regular spacing and consistent height intervals create a rhythmic pattern essential to identifying the building’s design. Even when transformed into LEGO, the **vertical stacking of windows** must remain in the same relative positions to preserve the building’s identity. This is a key structural identifier, and altering it would make the structure unrecognizable as the original. Hence, it is assigned 3 points.
    Question: Are the windows aligned vertically in the same columns across all floors?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2:  
    Thinking process: The red wooden door on the ground floor is a distinct visual marker, both in color and placement. It is located on the left side of the building and serves as a primary entrance. Its position relative to the other door and windows defines the building’s frontage. Changing its location or omitting it would disrupt the building’s recognizable façade. Thus, its **presence and position** are critical and must be preserved, even if its material becomes LEGO. This makes it a high-weight retention element.
    Question: Is there a red door located on the left side of the ground floor?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3:  
    Thinking process: The dark gray door on the right side of the ground floor complements the red door and completes the dual-entrance design typical of such buildings. Its presence ensures functional symmetry and architectural balance. Removing or relocating it would break the logical structure of the building’s entry system. While the material may change, its **position and existence** must remain intact. This is a key functional and visual element, thus weighted at 3 points.
    Question: Is there a dark-colored door located on the right side of the ground floor?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q4:  
    Thinking process: The climbing ivy grows vertically along the central portion of the building, covering several windows and balconies. Although the instruction allows replacing it with LEGO vines, the **path and coverage area** of the ivy must remain consistent to maintain visual continuity and architectural character. The location of the greenery is a defining aesthetic feature, and its absence or misplacement would alter the building’s appearance significantly. Therefore, its **location and extent** are important retention targets, assigned 2 points.
    Question: Does the climbing plant cover the central vertical strip of the building, spanning from near the ground floor up to the third floor?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5:  
    Thinking process: The red rectangle drawn around a specific section of the building (containing three windows and a balcony) is a deliberate annotation in the original image. It highlights a particular area of interest, possibly for real estate or architectural analysis. Since it is part of the original composition and not mentioned in the editing instructions as removable, it must be preserved in its exact position and shape. Losing it would remove a key contextual clue. This is a minor but significant detail, hence weighted at 2 points.
    Question: Is there a red rectangular outline enclosing a section of the building that includes three stacked windows and a balcony?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q6:  
    Thinking process: The balconies are positioned directly outside certain windows, forming a consistent pattern across the building. Their **relative placement** to the windows they serve is crucial for maintaining architectural logic. Even if the railings become LEGO-style, the balconies must remain attached to the same windows to preserve structural coherence. This spatial relationship is essential for functionality and recognition, making it a 2-point retention element.
    Question: Are the balconies located directly outside specific windows on the second, third, and fourth floors?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
