      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "The mid-air crouched posture with arms extended is the core action identifier of the skater. This pose defines the moment of the trick and is essential for recognizing the athletic movement. If lost, the image no longer represents a skateboarding maneuver, regardless of futuristic styling. It is a functional and visual anchor of the scene, making it a 3-point element.",
      "question": "Is the skater depicted in a mid-air crouched posture with both arms extended outward for balance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The foot placement — one on the board, one slightly lifted — is critical to the realism and mechanics of the skateboarding trick. Even if the board becomes a hoverboard, the foot positioning must remain consistent to preserve the illusion of motion. This is a functional element tied to the action, hence weight 3.",
      "question": "Is the skater’s left foot placed firmly on the skateboard while the right foot is slightly raised off the board?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The skater’s head and gaze direction toward the right side of the image indicate motion trajectory and focus. This aligns with the physics of the jump and maintains narrative consistency. Changing this would disrupt the sense of movement, making it a key directional cue worth 2 points.",
      "question": "Does the skater’s head and eyes look toward the right side of the frame, indicating forward momentum?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The spatial relationship between the skater and the ramp — specifically, the skater being clearly above the ramp surface — is essential for conveying the jump. If the skater appears grounded or below the ramp, the action fails. This is a logical spatial element critical to the scene’s coherence, hence 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the skater positioned above the surface of the ramp, indicating he is airborne?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The presence of the second figure (older man) running across the ramp provides depth, scale, and environmental context. While not central, its absence would remove a key detail from the original scene. Though the instruction doesn’t require retaining it, since it’s not listed for modification, it should be preserved to maintain visual fidelity. This is a secondary but identifiable detail, worth 1 point.",
      "question": "Is there a second person, an older man in a dark jacket, visible in the background running across the ramp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The curved ramp structure forms the bowl-like shape of the skatepark, defining the environment’s geometry. Even if stylized into a cyberpunk cityscape, the basic curved form should be retained to preserve the spatial logic of the jump. This is a key architectural feature of the original scene, worth 2 points.",
      "question": "Is there a curved ramp structure forming a bowl-like shape in the foreground, beneath the skater?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
