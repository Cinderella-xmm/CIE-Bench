      "thinking_process": "The direction and origin of sunlight beams from the upper-left quadrant is a core environmental feature that defines the lighting and mood of the entire scene. It interacts with the mist and highlights specific peaks, creating a sense of time and directionality. Altering this would fundamentally change the visual logic of the image and disconnect the fantasy transformation from the original lighting context. This is a key environmental identifier, making it a 3-point element.",
      "question": "Is the sunlight originating from the upper-left portion of the sky, casting diagonal rays across the mountain range?",

      "thinking_process": "The layered atmospheric haze between mountain ranges is essential for establishing depth and scale. It separates the foreground, midground, and background peaks and contributes to the ethereal quality of the scene. Removing or flattening this layering would collapse the three-dimensional structure of the landscape, undermining the realism necessary for the fantasy transformation to be believable. This is a major compositional element, hence 2 points.",
      "question": "Are there visible layers of mist or haze separating the mountain ranges at different depths?",

      "thinking_process": "The central tallest peak's position and prominence are critical to the composition. It serves as the focal point and anchor for the viewer’s gaze. Even when transformed into a dragon head, its location must remain unchanged to preserve spatial continuity. Moving it would violate the original framing and disorient the viewer. This is a structural core element, so it receives 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the tallest, most prominent peak located near the center of the image, rising above surrounding spires?",

      "thinking_process": "The green vegetation on the foreground shrubs and lower slopes provides ecological grounding and contrast against the rocky terrain. Its presence adds realism and helps distinguish the transformed areas from untouched ones. Removing or changing its color/texture would affect the believability of the scene’s environment. Though not central to identity, it supports visual coherence, thus worth 2 points.",
      "question": "Are there green leafy plants visible in the foreground, especially on the left side of the frame?",

      "thinking_process": "The sky’s color gradient — warm orange and pink near the horizon transitioning into cool blue-gray above — is a defining aesthetic and temporal cue. It signals sunrise or sunset and sets the emotional tone. Any significant alteration to this gradient would change the mood and time of day, breaking the consistency of the original atmosphere. This is a key atmospheric feature, therefore 3 points.",
      "question": "Does the sky display a gradient from warm orange-pink near the horizon to cooler blue-gray at the top?",

      "thinking_process": "The texture and appearance of non-transformed rock faces, particularly on slopes not designated as dragon parts, help maintain material consistency. These areas serve as visual anchors for the real-world geology, providing contrast to the fantastical elements. If these textures were replaced or smoothed, the distinction between natural and magical elements would blur, reducing clarity. This is a detail-level but important coherence element, so 1 point.",
