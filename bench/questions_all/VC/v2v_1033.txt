Description of reference image: The image features two enamel pins placed on a white card with a black border. One pin depicts a stylized bee with yellow and black stripes and translucent wings, while the other pin shows a yellow flower with a green stem and leaf. The text "ETERNITY BLOSSOM" is printed above the pins, separated by a horizontal line. The background is plain white, emphasizing the pins and the text.

Thinking process: The editing instructions specify transforming the pins into 3D collectibles within a romantic display box, altering their form and setting. However, the core identity of the bee and flower, including their distinctive colors and shapes, must be retained. The scene's background and card can be replaced, but the text "ETERNITY BLOSSOM" should remain as it is a key element linking the theme.

Allowed Changes List:
Specific element 1 that allows for changes: The form of the bee and flower pins can be transformed into 3D collectibles.
Specific element 2 that allows for changes: The background and card can be replaced with a romantic display box.
Specific element 3 that allows for changes: The arrangement and proportion of the bee and flower can be adjusted within the new scene.

Thinking process: Core recognition elements include the bee's yellow and black striped pattern and translucent wings, and the flower's yellow petals and green stem. These features are essential for identifying the subjects. Functional/logical association elements include the positioning of the bee and flower side by side, as this conveys harmony and friendship. Remaining elements, such as the specific shape and color of the pins, should be retained for visual coherence.

Preservation Targets List:
(Element 1 that should be maintained: Yellow and black striped pattern of the bee)
(Element 2 that should be maintained: Translucent wings of the bee)
(Element 3 that should be maintained: Yellow petals and green stem of the flower)
(Element 4 that should be maintained: Side-by-side positioning of the bee and flower)
