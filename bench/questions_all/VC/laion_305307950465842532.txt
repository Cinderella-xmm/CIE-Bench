**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject consists of two male individuals standing side by side in front of a wooden plank wall with the repeated text "FGL HOUSE" in white capital letters. The individual on the left wears a wide-brimmed beige cowboy hat, long wavy blonde hair, a white jacket with embroidered flamingo patterns, layered necklaces including a prominent circular pendant, and a floral-patterned shirt underneath. He has a light beard and mustache and is gesturing with his right hand open. The individual on the right has short, neatly styled brown hair, a trimmed beard, and wears a light blue denim-style jacket over a gray crewneck shirt. Both are smiling slightly and facing forward. The background features horizontal wooden planks of varying shades of brown, arranged in a staggered pattern, giving a rustic appearance. A lower-third banner at the bottom reads: "FLORIDA GEORGIA LINE: RISE TO THE TOP" in white capital letters on a dark blue background with a thin gold line beneath.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instructions specify a transformation into a **vintage western-themed collage poster** for an upcoming country concert. Key directives include:
- Replacing clothing patterns with **southwestern fabrics**, such as **denim and woven textile designs**
- Incorporating **rustic elements**: cacti silhouettes and a setting sun
- Modifying the **wooden background** to include these new elements
- Using a **handmade, distressed font** for the band name
- Adding **cowboy boots and hats** as decorative elements
- Ensuring a **cohesive and inviting layout**

From this, we infer:
- **Clothing patterns** can be changed (e.g., replacing current jackets with southwestern textiles)
- **Background elements** (wooden planks) can be altered to include **cacti silhouettes**, **setting sun**, and other thematic overlays
- **Text style** ("FGL HOUSE") and **lower-third title** can be modified to match the vintage western aesthetic
- **Decorative props** like cowboy boots and hats may be added, even if not present originally
- **Overall composition** can shift to a collage style

However, the **identity of the subjects**—the two men themselves—is central to the brand identity of Florida Georgia Line. Therefore, their **faces, facial features, body positions, and relative spatial arrangement** must remain intact unless explicitly stated otherwise. Since the instruction does not mention changing the subjects’ identities or altering their poses beyond styling, these should be preserved.

**Allowed Changes List:**
- Clothing patterns (jackets, shirts)
- Background textures and elements (addition of cacti, sunset, etc.)
- Text typography and placement (FGL HOUSE, lower third)
- Addition of symbolic objects (cowboy boots, hats)
- Overall color palette and visual style (to reflect vintage western theme)
- Layout structure (collage format)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
We now determine which elements must **not** be changed based on the above allowed modifications and core recognition logic:

1. **Core Recognition Elements**:
   - The **faces and facial features** of both individuals are essential for identification. Florida Georgia Line is a duo known by their distinct appearances—especially the long-haired man with the cowboy hat and the clean-cut partner. Altering their faces would make them unrecognizable.
   - Their **relative positioning** (side-by-side, left and right) must remain consistent to preserve the group's iconic image.
   - The **presence of the cowboy hat** on the left individual is a signature element of his public persona; while its design may change, it must remain present.
   - The **beard and hair length** of each person are key identifiers and should not be altered significantly.

2. **Functional/Logical Association Elements**:
   - The **spatial relationship** between the two individuals (standing close, facing forward) is important for maintaining the sense of partnership and unity. Changing their posture or separation could disrupt the intended message of collaboration.
   - The **lower-third text** “FLORIDA GEORGIA LINE: RISE TO THE TOP” identifies the content and purpose of the image. While the font may change, the **textual content itself must remain unchanged** to preserve informational integrity.

3. **Non-modified Element Deduction**:
   - After excluding allowed changes (clothing, background, fonts), the **original facial features**, **hair styles**, **body postures**, and **core accessories** (like the hat and necklaces) remain as non-negotiables.
   - Even though clothing can be replaced, the **fact that they are wearing jackets** and **gesturing outward with palms up** is part of their pose and should be retained in form, even if style changes.

**Preservation Targets List:**
- Facial features of both individuals (eyes, nose, mouth, beard, hairstyle)
- Relative positioning (left/right, side-by-side)
- Presence of the cowboy hat on the left individual
- Gestures (open hands, palms up)
- Lower-third text: "FLORIDA GEORGIA LINE: RISE TO THE TOP"
- The fact that both individuals are standing upright and facing forward

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The presence of the wide-brimmed cowboy hat on the left individual is a defining feature of his public identity within Florida Georgia Line. It is a core visual identifier that distinguishes him from the other member and is integral to their country music branding. Removing or replacing it entirely would alter the core recognition of the subject. Therefore, its presence must be preserved, even if its design is updated to match a vintage western theme.
    Question: Is the wide-brimmed cowboy hat still present on the head of the individual on the left?
    Choices: Yes, No

{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The relative positioning of the two individuals—side-by-side, with the left person slightly forward and gesturing—establishes their dynamic as a duo. This spatial relationship is important for maintaining the group’s visual identity. Changing their positions or orientation would disrupt the cohesive presentation of the band.
    Question: Are the two individuals standing side-by-side, with the left individual slightly forward and both facing the camera?

{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The gesture of both individuals extending their hands outward with palms up is a distinctive pose associated with this image. It conveys openness and engagement, contributing to the overall tone. While the hand position might be slightly adjusted, the core gesture must be preserved to maintain consistency with the original.
    Question: Are both individuals gesturing with their palms open and facing upward?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The lower-third banner containing the text "FLORIDA GEORGIA LINE: RISE TO THE TOP" provides essential context about the content. While the font or style may change per the vintage theme, the exact text must remain to ensure informational accuracy and continuity.

Any deviation, such as turning sideways or bending, would alter the intended visual narrative and reduce recognizability.
    Question: Are both individuals standing upright and facing directly toward the camera?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
