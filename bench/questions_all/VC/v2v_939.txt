### Step 1 - Description of Reference Image:

The subject is a child standing outdoors near a wall and a drainpipe, holding a colorful rainbow umbrella. The child is wearing a green raincoat with a hood, blue jeans, and green rain boots. The drainpipe is releasing water onto the ground, and the child appears to be smiling. The background consists of an orange wall with a brown door, and the ground is paved with cobblestones. The scene suggests a rainy day.

### Thinking Process:

Analyzing the instructions, the child's form will be transformed into a chibi-style 3D character, meaning the child's physical appearance will change significantly. However, the environment and some key elements must remain consistent. The instructions specify keeping the wall, drainpipe, and the overall scene realistic while enhancing the rain and reflections.

### Allowed Changes List:

1. The child's physical form can be changed to a chibi-style 3D character.
2. The size and design of the umbrella can be adjusted to be oversized and vibrant.
3. Raindrops and reflections can be enhanced for a more vivid effect.
4. The child's facial expression and posture can be stylized to fit the chibi aesthetic.

### Step 2 - Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged:

#### Thinking Process:

**Core Recognition Elements:** The drainpipe releasing water, the orange wall, and the brown door are key elements that define the scene. The child's green raincoat and boots are also distinctive features that should be recognizable even in chibi form.

**Functional/Logical Association Elements:** The child must still be positioned in front of the wall and drainpipe, holding the umbrella. The water flow from the drainpipe and the child's interaction with it should remain logically consistent.

**Non-Modified Element Deduction:** The cobblestone ground, the wall's texture, and the door's appearance should be retained for visual coherence.

#### Preservation Targets List:

1. The drainpipe releasing water onto the ground.
2. The orange wall and brown door in the background.
3. The child's green raincoat and boots.
4. The child's position in front of the wall and drainpipe.
5. The cobblestone ground texture.
