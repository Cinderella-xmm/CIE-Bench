      "thinking_process": "The balance beam is the foundational object enabling the gymnast’s performance. Its presence, material (wooden), and worn surface texture are key to identifying the setting as a real gymnastics competition. If removed or replaced with another object (e.g., a pole or platform), the scene loses its core functionality and identity. Therefore, preserving the beam’s physical characteristics is critical for maintaining the scene’s authenticity and purpose.",
      "question": "Is the balance beam made of wood with visible wear and chipped paint?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The handstand pose—specifically the inverted arch with legs raised and crossed—is the defining movement of the gymnast. It communicates both skill and control. Altering this posture fundamentally changes the nature of the action and could misrepresent the sport. While proportions may be elongated, the core shape of the backbend must remain intact to preserve the athletic intent.",
      "question": "Does the gymnast maintain a handstand with her body arched backward and legs lifted vertically above her head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The leotard’s gradient from silver on the torso to blue on the lower body is a distinctive visual signature. While the exact shade may vary, the two-tone structure and glittering pattern along the spine are unique to the original image. Removing or altering this design would obscure the athlete’s appearance and reduce visual coherence.",
      "question": "Is the leotard divided into silver upper body and blue lower body with a gradient transition and sparkles along the spine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The bun hairstyle with a blue hair tie is a specific personal detail that contributes to the gymnast’s identity. In competitive gymnastics, such grooming is standard and visually distinct. Changing the hairstyle or removing the hair tie would alter the character’s appearance significantly, especially in a stylized rendering where such details help anchor realism.",
      "question": "Is the gymnast’s hair styled in a tight bun secured with a blue hair tie?",

      "thinking_process": "The presence of chalk residue on the beam and hands indicates preparation for grip and reflects real-world gymnastics practices. This detail grounds the image in authenticity and connects the performer to the equipment. Removing it would make the scene appear less realistic or staged.",
      "question": "Are there visible chalk marks on the balance beam beneath the gymnast’s hands?",

      "thinking_process": "The small stud earring on the left ear is a subtle but identifiable feature that adds individuality to the character. While minor, such accessories contribute to visual consistency and prevent the figure from appearing generic. In artistic interpretations, retaining such details helps preserve the original subject’s likeness.",

      "thinking_process": "The side profile of the face with a focused gaze downward is crucial for conveying concentration and emotional engagement. This expression aligns with the intensity of competitive gymnastics. Altering the facial direction or expression could misrepresent the athlete’s state during performance.",

      "thinking_process": "The hands gripping the beam are functionally essential—they support the entire body weight in the handstand. Even if enlarged, their placement and contact with the beam must remain consistent to maintain logical action. Moving or repositioning them would break the physics of the pose.",
      "question": "Are the gymnast’s hands placed flat on top of the beam, supporting her body in a handstand?",

      "thinking_process": "The gloves (or grips) on the hands are part of standard gymnastics gear. Their presence reinforces the authenticity of the performance. While the instruction allows enlargement of hands, the grips themselves should remain identifiable as protective equipment.",

      "thinking_process": "The background includes a blurred audience and stadium lighting, establishing the setting as a formal competition. While the instruction allows abstraction, the general structure of tiered seating and bright ceiling lights must remain to preserve the context of a public event. Removing these would isolate the figure and lose environmental meaning.",
