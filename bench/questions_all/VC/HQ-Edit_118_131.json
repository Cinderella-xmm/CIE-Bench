      "thinking_process": "The key identification feature of this teapot is the **elephant’s head**, particularly the **large, flared ears** and **expressive eye**, which distinguish it from other animal-shaped teapots. These are core visual identifiers that define the subject’s identity. If the ears are removed or altered beyond recognition, the teapot would no longer be identifiable as elephant-shaped. Thus, their presence and form are critical.",
      "question": "Is the elephant’s head with large, flared ears and visible eye clearly present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The **trunk serving as the spout** is a defining functional and structural feature. It connects the head to the body and curves upward, forming the outlet. This is not just decorative—it defines the object’s purpose as a teapot. Any transformation must preserve this spatial and functional relationship. Losing the trunk-as-spout would break the identity of the object.",
      "question": "Is the trunk of the elephant clearly formed into the spout of the teapot, extending upward and backward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The **four-legged stance** is essential to the elephant’s anatomical form. Even if stylized, the legs must support the body and maintain the weight-bearing posture of an elephant. Altering or removing them would fundamentally change the creature’s identity and make it unrecognizable as an elephant.",
      "question": "Are four distinct legs supporting the body of the elephant-teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The **domed lid with a pointed finial** is a distinctive architectural feature of the teapot. It sits atop the body and completes the vessel’s form. Its presence is crucial for identifying the object as a teapot, even if the rest is stylized. Removing or altering the lid would disrupt the functional closure of the teapot.",
      "question": "Is there a domed lid with a pointed finial on top of the teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The **floral engraving patterns** (especially lotus and vine motifs) cover the body and are a hallmark of the original design. While the instruction allows steampunk modifications, the **underlying decorative style** must still be recognizable. If the floral patterns are completely erased or obscured, the artistic identity of the piece is lost. Their presence ensures continuity with the original aesthetic.",
      "question": "Are floral patterns, including lotus flowers and vines, visibly engraved on the body of the teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The **silver metallic texture** is fundamental to the material identity of the object. While copper accents may be added, the base material remains silver. The reflective, polished surface is a key visual characteristic. Changing it entirely (e.g., to matte black) would alter the perceived material and diminish authenticity.",
      "question": "Is the teapot primarily rendered in a silver metallic finish with reflective highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The **matching cup and saucer** are part of the original composition and contribute to the tea-serving context. Though they may be resized or repositioned in the diorama, their **presence** is important for maintaining the narrative of a tea set. Their removal would break the thematic coherence.",
      "question": "Is a matching silver cup and saucer present next to the teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
