      "thinking_process": "The bite mark is the most distinctive feature of the pear in the original image, serving as a clear identifier of consumption and imperfection. Its irregular shape, location on the right side, and exposure of white flesh are unique and non-replaceable. The instruction specifies that the bitten section must \"complement the pear's characteristics\" in the new animal design, meaning this feature must be preserved in form and position. Losing it would make the new creature unrecognizable as a pear derivative. Therefore, this is a core identity element with a weight of 3 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The wood grain texture and warm brown color of the original backdrop are explicitly required to be reflected in the minimalist interior of the glass cube. This is not a stylistic choice but a direct preservation mandate. The texture and color define the environmental tone and must be visually consistent with the original. If these are absent or altered significantly, the connection to the original image is broken. This is a key scene element with a weight of 3 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The speckled skin texture of the pear is a defining characteristic of its realism and identity. While not explicitly mentioned, the instruction to model the animal after the pear implies that such textural details must be retained to maintain authenticity. Removing the speckles would make the animal appear artificial or unrelated to the original fruit. This is an important detail that supports visual coherence and recognition, hence a weight of 2 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The stem is a critical anatomical feature of the pear, anchoring its identity as a fruit. The instruction does not mention removing it, and since the animal is modeled after the pear, the stem must logically be preserved as part of the design. Its absence would disrupt the visual continuity and make the creature less recognizable. This is a functional and identity-related element, warranting a weight of 2 points.",

The shape defines the form and distinguishes it from other fruits. Any significant deviation would result in a loss of recognition. This is a core structural element, thus assigned a weight of 3 points.",

While lighting can be adjusted for drama, the instruction mandates that warm hues be preserved. This ensures visual consistency and emotional tone continuity. Although lighting is not a static object, its color temperature is a key atmospheric element that must be retained. This is a secondary but important detail affecting coherence, hence a weight of 1 point.",
