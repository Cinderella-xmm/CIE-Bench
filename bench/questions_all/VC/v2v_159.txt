Description of reference image: The subject consists of a pair of human legs wearing beige pants, white socks, and beige sneakers with white soles and laces. The legs are positioned as if walking, with one foot slightly lifted. The background is a serene sky filled with fluffy white clouds, giving an impression of floating above the clouds.

### Step 1 - Allowed Changes List:

Thinking process: The instructions specify transforming the image into a bobblehead style, increasing the shoe size while preserving their design, making the legs more cartoon-like, and placing them on a cloud-shaped shelf. Therefore, the following changes are allowed:

- Specific element 1 that allows for changes: Increase the size of the shoes while keeping their design intact.
- Specific element 2 that allows for changes: Modify the legs to appear more cartoon-like.
- Specific element 3 that allows for changes: Replace the current cloud background with a cloud-shaped shelf.

### Step 2 - Preservation Targets List:

Thinking process: Core recognition elements include the design and color of the sneakers, as they are central to the subject's identity. Functional/logical elements include the positioning of the feet and legs, as they convey the action of walking. Remaining elements like the pants and socks contribute to visual coherence.

Preservation Targets List:
- Design and color of the sneakers
- Positioning of the feet and legs
- Pants and socks
