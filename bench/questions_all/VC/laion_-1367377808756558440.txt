**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a large naval vessel, specifically a gray warship marked with the hull number "J244" in bold black numerals on its side. The ship features a prominent mast with rigging, a central tower structure, and a dark blue funnel-like feature at the top. It has multiple portholes, gun mounts (including one visible on the bow), and a British flag flying from a secondary mast. A smaller yellow boat labeled "HULL HAMLET TOWN" is docked nearby in the foreground. The scene includes a wooden pier with green lampposts, several pedestrians walking along it, and industrial port cranes in the background under a partly cloudy sky. The Australian flag is visible on a separate pole to the left. The overall composition places the ship as the dominant element, with people and infrastructure providing scale and context.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction explicitly transforms the entire scene into a **steampunk-styled miniature diorama inside a vintage glass lantern**, indicating that the **form, scale, and environment** are to be radically altered. Key transformations include:
- The **ship becomes a mechanical model** with brass finishes and rotating gears → this changes material, texture, and function.
- The **dock figures become metal automatons** wearing Victorian attire → human forms are replaced by robotic analogs.
- The **entire scene is enclosed within a glass lantern** → spatial containment and perspective shift.
- **Floating steam clouds** are added → new atmospheric elements not present originally.
- **Oversized compasses and maritime flags** are incorporated → new symbolic elements.

However, the instruction does **not** specify replacing or removing any core identity features of the original ship or scene. Instead, it reimagines them through a thematic lens while preserving their **identity and role** (e.g., the ship remains a naval vessel, the dock remains a harbor setting). Therefore, although form and materials change, the **core recognition elements** of the ship (hull number, silhouette, key structural components) and the **scene’s functional logic** (ship docked at pier, people walking, cranes in background) must remain identifiable.

---

**Allowed Changes List:**
- The **material and finish** of the ship (e.g., changing from painted steel to brass and copper)
- The **appearance and clothing** of pedestrians (transformed into automatons with Victorian attire)
- The **environmental context** (from open harbor to enclosed glass lantern)
- The **addition of floating steam clouds**
- The **inclusion of oversized compasses and flags** as decorative elements
- The **scale and framing** (miniature diorama within a lantern)
- The **lighting and atmosphere** (to match steampunk aesthetic)
- The **texture and color palette** of all objects (shift toward metallic, aged brass, and sepia tones)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
We now identify what **must not change**, based on exclusion from the allowed changes list and logical necessity for identity retention:

1. **Core Recognition Elements**:  
   - The **hull number "J244"** is a unique identifier of the ship; altering it would misrepresent the vessel's identity. Even if stylized, its presence and position must be preserved.
   - The **overall shape and silhouette** of the ship (especially the superstructure, mast, funnel, and bow gun) define its naval identity. These forms are essential for recognizing the vessel type (likely a minesweeper or patrol vessel).
   - The **British flag** on the secondary mast is a national identifier and historical detail tied to the ship’s origin. Its presence and placement must be retained even if stylized.
   - The **Australian flag** on the left pole is part of the geographical context and should remain visually recognizable.

2. **Functional/Logical Association Elements**:  
   - The **position of the ship relative to the dock** (docked at the pier) maintains spatial logic. If the ship were floating freely or placed incorrectly, the scene loses coherence.
   - The **presence of the pier and lampposts** provides environmental continuity. Their layout supports the narrative of a harbor setting.
   - The **yellow boat labeled "HULL HAMLET TOWN"** serves as a contextual anchor. Its label and color must remain readable to preserve scene specificity.

3. **Non-Modified Element Deduction**:  
   - While the people may become automatons, their **positions and paths along the pier** should reflect the original movement pattern (e.g., three individuals walking together).
   - The **cranes in the background** establish industrial port context. Their **number, shape, and relative positioning** must remain consistent to maintain realism within the transformed scene.
   - The **green lampposts** are distinctive fixtures; their **color and curved design** should persist even if rendered in brass or with mechanical details.

Thus, despite transformation into a steampunk diorama, the **essential visual identifiers**—such as the ship’s number, silhouette, flags, and surrounding landmarks—must remain intact in form and location to ensure fidelity to the original subject.

**Preservation Targets List:**
- The hull number "J244" on the ship’s side
- The silhouette and structural features of the ship (mast, funnel, gun mount, superstructure)
- The British flag on the secondary mast
- The Australian flag on the left pole
- The yellow boat labeled "HULL HAMLET TOWN"
- The green lampposts with curved arms
- The position and orientation of the ship relative to the dock
- The three pedestrians walking along the pier
- The industrial cranes in the background
- The wooden pier surface and railing

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The hull number "J244" is a critical identifier of the specific naval vessel depicted. It is a unique alphanumeric code used for official identification, and its absence or alteration would render the ship unrecognizable as the original subject. This is a core identity feature that must be preserved regardless of stylistic changes like brass plating or gear integration.
