Description of reference image: The subject is a small sparrow perched on a dark brown tree branch, facing slightly to the left. The bird has a rich reddish-brown crown with distinct white and black striped patterns across its head and eye region. Its eyes are bright blue, round, and reflective, with a clear black pupil. The beak is short, pointed, and pale grayish-yellow in color. The chest and belly are soft buff-orange, transitioning into darker brown and black streaked feathers on the wings and back. The tail is long and fan-shaped, composed of layered dark brown feathers with lighter edges. The bird’s legs are thin and pinkish-red, gripping the branch firmly. Surrounding the bird are delicate cherry blossoms in full bloom—light pink petals with visible yellow stamens and subtle red centers. Some buds remain closed, showing deep pink hues. Fresh green leaves sprout from the branches, some still curled. The background features softly blurred cherry blossom trees under a warm golden sunlight, creating a dreamy bokeh effect with scattered light rays and pastel tones. The overall composition emphasizes natural harmony between the bird and the flowering environment.

Thinking process:  
First, analyze the editing instructions word by word:  
- "Transform the sparrow into an ethereal blossom spirit" → indicates complete transformation of the **subject's form**, meaning its original biological structure (e.g., body shape, feather pattern) can be altered.  
- "Featuring petal-like feathers with a soft pink gradient" → modifies **feather texture and color**, so original feather structure and color are no longer required.  
- "Blossom patterns along its wings" → replaces wing details; original wing markings may be changed.  
- "Glowing emerald-green eyes" → changes eye color and glow, so original blue eyes are not required.  
- "Replace the tail with cascading cherry blossoms" → explicitly removes original tail feathers; tail is fully replaced.  
- "Embed delicate vines around its legs" → alters leg appearance; original leg form can change.  
- "Add sparkling dewdrop ornaments to its chest" → adds new elements not present originally; chest area is modified.  

Scene elements:  
- The cherry blossom tree branches and flowers are part of the scene but are **not specified for removal**. However, since the instruction does not say “retain the background” or “keep the blossoms unchanged,” the **blossom branches and their arrangement may be adjusted** as long as they support the new spirit theme.  
- But note: the instruction says “replace the tail with cascading cherry blossoms” — this implies that **cherry blossoms are still central to the design**, so the **presence of cherry blossoms in the scene is likely preserved**, though possibly reimagined.  
- The lighting (golden sunlight, soft glow) is not mentioned, so it could be altered, but the **general springtime floral atmosphere** may be retained due to thematic continuity.

Allowed Changes List:  
- The sparrow’s body form (including head shape, beak, and limbs) can be transformed into a blossom spirit.  
- Feather texture and color (original brown/white/black patterns) can be replaced with petal-like pink gradients.  
- Eye color and luminosity (original blue eyes) can be changed to glowing emerald-green.  
- Tail feathers can be entirely replaced with cascading cherry blossoms.  
- Legs can have vines wrapped around them.  
- Chest can include added dewdrop ornaments.  
- Wing patterns can be replaced with blossom motifs.  
- Background cherry blossoms and branches may be reinterpreted or stylized, but not necessarily removed.  

Step 2 – Determine the elements that should remain unchanged  

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements:  
- The **subject is a sparrow**, but the instruction explicitly transforms it into a "blossom spirit." This means the **biological identity of the sparrow is being abandoned**, so **no core recognition features of the real sparrow need to be preserved**. However, the **original image contains specific visual elements that must be retained if not overridden** — even if the subject is transformed, **the scene context and certain environmental features may still need to be preserved** unless explicitly changed.  
- The **cherry blossom branches and flowers** are not stated to be removed. In fact, they are used as materials in the transformation (e.g., tail replaced with blossoms), suggesting that **the presence of cherry blossoms is essential to the theme**, so their **existence in the scene should be maintained**, though possibly stylized.  
- The **branch structure** on which the bird sits is not mentioned to be changed — it is implied as the perch for the new spirit, so **its position and general form should remain** to maintain spatial logic.  
- The **lighting and atmosphere** (soft golden light, hazy sky) are not specified to change, so while tone might shift, **the ambient lighting direction and warm glow should be preserved** to maintain scene coherence.  

Functional/logical association elements:  
- The **bird is perched on a branch** — this is a functional relationship. Even if transformed, the **perching posture and branch contact point must remain** to preserve logical positioning.  
- The **spatial layout** — bird centered, facing left, surrounded by blossoms — suggests compositional balance. Though style changes, **this framing should be preserved** to avoid disorientation.  

Non-modified element deduction:  
- After excluding allowed changes (body, feathers, eyes, tail, legs, chest), what remains?  
  - The **branch itself** — not mentioned for change, so its **shape, position, and texture** should be retained.  
  - The **cherry blossoms** — not said to be removed; in fact, they are reused in the design, so their **presence, color (pink), and floral structure** must remain.  
  - The **background lighting** — not mentioned to change, so **direction of light (from upper left), warmth, and bokeh effect** should persist.  
  - The **overall setting** — a flowering tree in spring — is implied to continue, so **naturalistic environment elements** like leaf shapes and bloom clusters should stay.  

Preservation Targets List:  
- The dark brown branch the bird is perched on  
- The presence of pink cherry blossoms with visible stamens and petals  
- The position of the bird on the branch (center-left, facing left)  
- The direction of sunlight (upper left, casting warm glow)  
- The green leaves emerging from the branches  
- The general depth and layering of the background (blurred blossoms and branches)  

Q1:  
Thinking process: The dark brown branch serves as the primary structural anchor for the composition. It provides the perch for the bird and defines the spatial relationship between the subject and the environment. If the branch were removed or significantly altered in shape or position, the entire scene would lose coherence and logical grounding. Its presence is essential for maintaining the original visual narrative. The instruction does not mention changing the branch, only transforming the bird and adding new elements, so the branch must remain intact. This is a core functional element supporting both subject placement and scene realism.  
Question: Is the dark brown tree branch on which the bird is perched clearly visible and positioned in the same location as in the original image?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The pink cherry blossoms are central to both the scene and the transformation theme. They are not only background elements but also integrated into the new design (e.g., tail replaced with blossoms). Their presence ensures continuity between the original and edited versions. Removing or altering their color, shape, or number would disrupt the thematic consistency. The original image shows distinct five-petaled flowers with yellow stamens and pink petals — these specific visual traits must be preserved even if stylized. This is a key environmental identifier.  
Question: Are the pink five-petaled cherry blossoms with visible yellow stamens and red centers still present in the scene, particularly near the bird and along the branches?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The bird’s position on the branch — centered, facing slightly left — establishes the composition. Even after transformation, the subject must occupy the same spatial location to maintain visual alignment with the original. Changing its position would misalign the viewer’s focus and break the intended framing. This is a critical compositional element.  
Question: Is the bird (or its transformed spirit form) positioned on the same branch, in the same central-left location, facing toward the left side of the frame?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The green leaves emerging from the branches are minor but important detail elements that reinforce the springtime setting. While not central to the transformation, their presence contributes to the naturalism of the scene. The original image shows young, curled green leaves with visible veins. Their retention ensures visual fidelity to the season and environment. Although not core, they are distinctive enough to affect coherence if removed.  
Question: Are there fresh green leaves with curled tips and visible veins growing from the branches, particularly near the bird and in the foreground?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The warm golden sunlight coming from the upper left creates a soft glow and highlights the bird and blossoms. This lighting direction is crucial for mood and depth. The instruction does not specify changing the lighting, so the original illumination must be preserved to maintain atmospheric consistency. Altering the light source would change the time of day and emotional tone. This is a key environmental feature.  
Question: Is the sunlight originating from the upper left, casting a warm golden glow across the scene and creating soft highlights on the bird and blossoms?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The background features blurred cherry blossoms and branches, creating a bokeh effect that enhances depth. This layering is essential for spatial perception. While the background may be softened further, the **presence of out-of-focus pink blooms and dark branches** must remain to preserve the sense of a dense flowering tree. Removing this would flatten the image and disconnect it from the original setting.  
Question: Does the background contain softly blurred pink cherry blossoms and dark tree branches, forming a layered depth effect behind the main subject?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2
