Description of reference image: The subject is a sandwich placed on a white square plate, with a visible cross-section revealing layers of ingredients including a slice of cheese, pieces of meat (possibly steak or roast beef), lettuce, and tomato. The bread appears freshly baked with a golden-brown crust. There are some additional greens scattered on the plate beside the sandwich. The background is a wooden table surface.

Thinking process:
The instructions specify repainting the image in a thick-painted cartoon style, simplifying certain elements like lettuce, and adding sauce decorations. The sandwich's core structure and composition remain central, while the specific details of ingredients like the texture of the bread and the precise layering must be preserved in a simplified form. The scene retains the white plate and wooden background, as there are no explicit instructions for changing this environment.

Allowed Changes List:
1. Repainting the image in thick-painted cartoon style.
2. Simplifying the lettuce into smeared green shapes.
3. Adding sauce decorations around the plate.
4. Adjusting the overall color scheme and light/shadow effects to match a cartoon style.

Thinking process:
Core recognition elements include the sandwich's distinct cross-section showing layered ingredients and the bread's golden-brown crust. The functional/logical association involves the sandwich's structural integrity—ingredients need to be visible as layers within the bread. Visual coherence requires retaining the white plate and wooden background.

Preservation Targets List:
1. Sandwich cross-section with layered ingredients.
2. Golden-brown crust of the bread.
3. White plate and its rectangular shape.
4. Wooden texture of the table.
