      "thinking_process": "The rust-orange color of the jacket is a key visual identifier in the original image. It distinguishes the character from the surrounding white snow and dark trees, making it a core recognition feature. In the edited version, even if stylized, this color must be preserved to maintain character consistency. If replaced with another hue, the character would no longer be visually identifiable as the same individual. This is a high-weight element because it is a primary distinguishing trait.",

      "thinking_process": "The presence of the snowboard under the character’s feet is essential to the action and identity. Without it, the character cannot be recognized as a snowboarder. The snowboard’s position and function are central to the scene’s logic. Even in Chibi form, the board must be visible and correctly placed beneath the feet to preserve the action’s integrity.",

      "thinking_process": "The black helmet with red-tinted goggles is a distinctive accessory that contributes to the character’s identity. The red tint reflects the snowy environment and is a unique visual cue. Changing the color or removing the goggles would alter the character’s appearance significantly. This combination is a key identifier and must be preserved in the stylized version.",
      "question": "Does the character wear a black helmet with red-tinted goggles?",

      "thinking_process": "The long brown hair flowing behind the character indicates motion and adds to the dynamic feel of the scene. It is a defining physical trait that helps identify the character. In the Chibi version, while the style may be simplified, the hair must remain long and brown to maintain visual continuity.",
      "question": "Does the character have long brown hair?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The character is wearing black snow pants, which are part of the standard snowboarding attire and help distinguish her from the background. While the style may be simplified, the color and type of pants must remain consistent to preserve the character’s outfit identity. Changing the color or replacing them with different pants would disrupt the visual coherence.",
      "question": "Are the character’s pants black?",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The character is fully visible in the original image, with no parts cropped out. The instruction requires that each sticker shows the character “complete,” meaning no limbs or body parts should be missing. This ensures consistency across the sticker set and maintains the character’s full form.",

      "thinking_process": "The gloves are part of the character’s winter gear and contribute to the overall outfit. They are small but important details that help complete the snowboarding look. Removing or changing their color would affect the authenticity of the character’s appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q8",
      "thinking_process": "The background is a snowy forest with evergreen trees, which sets the winter scene. While the instruction allows for stylization, the theme of a snowy landscape must be preserved. The presence of snow-covered trees in the background is essential to evoke the winter setting required by the instruction.",
