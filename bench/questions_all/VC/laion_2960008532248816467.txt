Description of reference image: The subject consists of two Pablo cheese tarts placed on a dark wooden surface. The tart in the foreground is whole, while the one behind it is partially sliced, revealing its creamy white interior and golden-brown crust. Both tarts feature a glossy, caramelized yellow top layer with a distinct logo burned into the surface: a stylized "P" resembling a cart or carriage with a circular wheel and a small heart-shaped detail above it, followed by the word "PABLO" in uppercase letters beneath it. The crust has a flaky, slightly uneven texture with golden-brown edges, and the filling shows a smooth transition from the bright yellow top to the soft white base. The background is composed of vertical wood grain patterns in rich brown tones, providing a warm contrast to the vibrant yellow of the tarts.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions that explicitly allow transformation of the subject into a whimsical illustration for a children’s storybook. This includes anthropomorphizing the front tart with eyes and a smile, adding animated forest creatures on the crust rim, and overlaying a dreamy forest scene with a swirling path and pastel flowers. These changes imply that the form, expression, and surrounding environment of the tarts are permitted to be altered. However, the instruction does not mention changing the core identity markers such as the logo, brand name, or structural composition of the tarts themselves—only how they are visually interpreted within a new narrative context. Therefore, elements like the logo design, text, and physical structure of the tarts (e.g., shape, layered fillings) are not explicitly allowed to be changed unless redefined by the artistic interpretation.

Allowed Changes List:
- The facial features (eyes, smile) added to the front tart
- Animated forest creatures on the crust rim
- Swirling path leading into a forest setting
- Green foliage and pastel flowers surrounding the tarts
- Overall style transformation into a whimsical, illustrative format

Step 2– Determine the elements that should remain unchanged  
Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements: The Pablo brand logo and the word "PABLO" are critical identifiers for the product. They are uniquely designed and serve as trademarked visual signatures. Changing their form, position, or legibility would undermine brand recognition. Even in a whimsical adaptation, these elements must retain their original design characteristics to maintain authenticity and traceability to the original product. The iconic yellow top layer and white filling also represent the distinctive appearance of the Pablo cheese tart; altering their color or structure would change the fundamental identity of the dessert.

Functional/logical association elements: The relationship between the two tarts—one whole, one sliced—is important for demonstrating the internal texture and structure of the product. This layout supports the viewer's understanding of the tart’s composition and quality. If this spatial arrangement were disrupted, it could mislead about the product’s nature. Additionally, the presence of the logo on both tarts ensures consistent branding across both views, which is essential for commercial identification.

Non modified element deduction: After excluding the allowed changes (facial expressions, animals, forest scenery), all other unmentioned aspects of the tarts—such as the exact shape of the crust, the gradient from yellow to white, the texture of the filling, and the placement of the logo—are not specified for modification and thus must be preserved based on visual coherence and fidelity to the original. These details contribute to the realistic representation of the product before stylization.

Preservation Targets List:  
- The stylized "P" logo with cart-like shape and circular wheel  
- The word "PABLO" printed below the logo  
- The bright yellow top layer of the tart  
- The white creamy filling beneath the yellow layer  
- The golden-brown, flaky crust with irregular edges  
- The partial slice revealing the internal cross-section of the tart  
- The relative positioning of the two tarts (one whole, one sliced)

    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The stylized "P" logo with a cart-like shape and circular wheel is the primary brand identifier of Pablo Cheese Tart. Its unique design, including the curved handle and wheel, is central to public recognition of the product. If this logo is altered or replaced, the tart would no longer be identifiable as a Pablo product, making it a core identity element. Therefore, it must be retained in its original form.
    Question: Is the stylized "P" logo with a cart-like shape and circular wheel present on the surface of both tarts?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The word "PABLO" directly beneath the logo is a textual component of the brand identity. It reinforces the brand name and is inseparable from the logo in terms of recognition. Removing or distorting this text would compromise brand clarity. Since the instruction does not specify changing the text, it must be preserved as a key identifier.
    Question: Is the word "PABLO" written in uppercase letters beneath the logo on both tarts?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The bright yellow top layer is a defining visual trait of the Pablo cheese tart, distinguishing it from other cheesecakes. This color is a result of the caramelization process and is crucial to the product's visual appeal. Any significant deviation in hue or coverage would alter the product’s identity.
    Question: Does the top surface of each tart display a bright yellow layer covering most of the surface?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The white creamy filling beneath the yellow layer is a structural and textural hallmark of the tart. It represents the soft, custard-like interior that contrasts with the crisp crust. Preserving this layer ensures the accurate depiction of the product’s internal composition, which is essential for consumer recognition.
    Question: Is there a visible white creamy filling beneath the yellow top layer in both tarts, especially in the sliced portion?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The golden-brown, flaky crust with irregular edges is a key physical attribute that defines the tart’s baked appearance. It contributes to the perception of freshness and artisanal quality. While minor artistic exaggeration may be allowed, the basic texture and color of the crust must remain intact to preserve the product’s realism.
    Question: Does the crust of both tarts exhibit a golden-brown color with a flaky, uneven edge?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2

{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The partial slice of the rear tart reveals the internal cross-section, showing the layered structure of crust, filling, and top layer. This detail is functionally important as it demonstrates the product’s texture and depth. Altering or removing this section would misrepresent the tart’s true form.
    Question: Is the rear tart partially sliced to reveal the internal cross-section of the filling and crust?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The relative positioning of the two tarts—one whole in front, one sliced behind—creates a compositional balance that highlights both the exterior and interior of the product. This layout is a deliberate presentation choice and helps convey the full character of the tart. Disrupting this arrangement would affect the informative value of the image.
    Question: Is the whole tart positioned in front of the partially sliced tart, with the latter slightly elevated and angled toward the back?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
