      "thinking_process": "The **presence and position of the red insignia on the left lapel** is a unique identifying marker. It is not mentioned in the editing instructions and serves as a key symbol of identity or affiliation. If removed or relocated, the image loses contextual authenticity and could misrepresent the subject’s status. Its retention ensures fidelity to the original subject’s identity and official representation. This is a core symbolic element, thus weighted 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the red circular insignia still present on the left lapel of the suit jacket?",

      "thinking_process": "The **shape and position of the ear** are critical anatomical features for facial recognition. Changing its form or location would distort the face beyond recognition. Since the instruction does not mention modifying the ear, it must remain unchanged. This is a core identity element; loss would compromise identification. Weighted 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the ear clearly visible on the left side of the head in its original anatomical position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The **facial expression**, particularly the **smile with visible upper teeth**, is a defining emotional cue and recognizable trait. Altering this would change the subject's demeanor and affect recognition. The instruction does not mention modifying facial expression, so it must be preserved. This is a key identity feature, hence 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the mouth open in a natural smile showing the upper row of teeth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The **nose shape**, including its bridge and tip, is a primary facial landmark. Any significant alteration would make the face unrecognizable. As no instruction refers to modifying the nose, it must remain intact. This is a core structural feature essential for identity, so weighted 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the nose retaining its original shape with a distinct bridge and rounded tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The **head orientation** (three-quarter profile, facing right) establishes spatial context and posture. Changing this would alter the composition and perception of the subject. Since no instruction mentions repositioning the head, the orientation must be preserved. This is an important scene-related element affecting overall consistency, thus 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the head turned to the right in a three-quarter profile view?",

      "thinking_process": "The **background** is plain and off-white, serving as a neutral backdrop that emphasizes the subject. The instruction does not mention changing the background, so it must remain unchanged to preserve visual focus and context. While not a core identity element, it is crucial for scene coherence and aesthetic balance. Weighted 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the background uniformly off-white with no additional textures or objects?",

      "thinking_process": "The **lighting direction and softness**, evident from the gentle shadows under the chin and along the jawline, contribute to depth and realism. Although not explicitly mentioned, altering lighting would affect facial structure perception. Since no instruction specifies lighting change, it should remain consistent. This is a secondary but important detail for visual coherence, thus 1 point.",
      "question": "Are the shadows under the chin and along the jawline soft and consistent with even frontal lighting?",

      "thinking_process": "The **neck-to-collar junction** is a functional connection point between the shirt and suit. Even if the clothing is transformed, this anatomical connection must remain logical. The instruction modifies clothing style but not body structure, so this interface must persist. This is a minor but necessary detail for realism. Weighted 1 point.",
      "question": "Is the shirt collar properly aligned and connected to the neck beneath the suit jacket?",
