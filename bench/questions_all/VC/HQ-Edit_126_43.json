      "thinking_process": "The dual clock faces with Roman numerals are the most iconic identification features of the mantel clock. Their presence on two adjacent sides is a defining characteristic of this specific type of antique timepiece. Even if one face is replaced with a monocled eye, the existence and placement of at least one clock face with Roman numerals must be preserved to retain the original object’s identity. Losing both would make it impossible to recognize the source subject, thus violating the core identity requirement. Therefore, this element is critical and assigned 3 points.",
      "question": "Is there at least one clock face with Roman numerals visible on the front or side of the structure?",

      "thinking_process": "The glass panels below the clock faces that expose the pendulums and weights are essential functional and aesthetic elements. They distinguish this clock from others by showcasing its internal mechanics. Even if the pendulum becomes a tail, the **presence of transparent panels** showing internal moving parts must be maintained to preserve the logical structure of the original design. Removing or obscuring them would disrupt the connection between the old and new forms, making the transformation inconsistent. This is a key structural detail, hence 2 points.",
      "question": "Are there transparent glass panels on the lower section of the clock showing internal mechanical components such as pendulums and weights?",

      "thinking_process": "The ornate base with relief carvings—including circular medallions and floral patterns—is a unique decorative feature that contributes to the clock’s antique character. While the instruction allows for engraving new patterns, it does not specify removal of existing ones. Therefore, the **original carving style and layout** must be preserved to maintain authenticity and continuity. Altering or erasing these details without substitution would break visual coherence. This is a secondary but important identity marker, worth 2 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The pencil placed vertically to the right of the clock serves as a scale reference and compositional anchor. Since the instruction does not mention modifying or removing it, its presence must be preserved. Its inclusion maintains the artistic context of the drawing, suggesting a sketch or design process. Removing it would alter the scene’s narrative and reduce visual consistency. This is a minor but necessary environmental detail, hence 1 point.",
      "question": "Is there a sharpened wooden pencil standing vertically to the right of the clock, with its graphite tip pointing upward?",

      "thinking_process": "The background consists of a light-toned surface with faint grid lines resembling graph paper. This provides a consistent framework for the illustration and enhances the technical drawing aesthetic. Since no instruction specifies changing the background, it must remain unchanged. Its preservation ensures the scene remains coherent and stylistically unified. This is a subtle but important contextual element, worth 1 point.",

      "thinking_process": "The overall vertical, rectangular structure of the clock—with its tiered sections, columns, and symmetrical form—is fundamental to its identity as a mantel clock. Even if transformed into a creature, the **basic silhouette and proportional relationships** must be preserved to maintain recognition. A completely abstract or asymmetrical redesign would lose the essence of the original object. This structural integrity is crucial and assigned 3 points.",
