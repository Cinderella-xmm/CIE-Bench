      "thinking_process": "The weathered wooden wall with peeling red paint is the dominant background element and a key visual identifier of the scene’s age and character. Its texture—characterized by vertical planks, patches of exposed wood, and remnants of red paint—is essential for establishing the rustic, nostalgic mood. Removing or altering this would fundamentally change the environment and disconnect the transformed bicycle from its original context. This is a core environmental feature that grounds the image, making it a high-weight retention target.",

      "thinking_process": "The rough wooden floorboards provide a consistent surface that complements the wall and supports the bicycle’s placement. Their presence maintains spatial coherence and reinforces the setting as a barn or shed. Changing the floor would disrupt the environmental logic and make the scene feel disjointed. While not as visually dominant as the wall, it is a critical structural component of the scene.",
      "question": "Are the floorboards made of rough, aged wood with visible grain and gaps between planks?",

      "thinking_process": "The red reflector on the rear fender is a small but distinct detail that adds authenticity to the vintage bicycle. It is a real-world safety feature and contributes to the originality of the object. Although the instruction allows transformation of the bicycle, this accessory is not mentioned for removal, so it should remain as a subtle identifying mark. Its absence would reduce visual fidelity.",

      "thinking_process": "The wire mesh basket on the front handlebars is a defining functional feature of the bicycle, associated with utility and classic design. While the instruction allows integration of clock faces at the handlebars, it does not specify removing the basket. Therefore, the basket must be retained, possibly integrated into the steampunk design (e.g., with brass trim), but not omitted. Its presence ensures continuity with the original object.",

      "thinking_process": "The luggage rack above the rear wheel is another functional accessory unique to this bicycle model. It is a key structural detail that distinguishes it from other bikes. Since the instruction does not mention replacing or removing it, it must be preserved—even if modified—to maintain the original object’s identity. Its removal would weaken the connection to the source image.",

      "thinking_process": "The overall lighting, including soft shadows cast by the bicycle onto the wall and floor, establishes depth and mood. The warm tone and directional light suggest a single source, likely from the left side. Altering this would change the perception of time, space, and realism. Since no instruction mentions adjusting lighting, it must be preserved to maintain visual consistency.",
