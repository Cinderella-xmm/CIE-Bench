Description of reference image: 
The image shows two women standing outdoors facing a shop window, observing the displayed goods. They are positioned in a way that their backs are visible to the camera. The woman on the left has long dark hair, wearing a navy jacket with a beige shoulder bag, and black pants. The woman on the right has medium-length blonde hair, dressed in a beige sweater with a brown shoulder bag, and light blue jeans. Inside the shop window, there are mannequins dressed in coordinated outfits showcasing handbags. The shop window lighting is warm, creating soft highlights that illuminate the products and the mannequins. The background outside the store consists of a cobblestone street.

### Step 1 - Allowed Changes List:
Thinking process: 
The editing instruction clearly states transforming the image style into a high-end commercial illustration like Vogue magazine covers. This implies we can change the real textures to soft gradients and emphasize clear lines and contours. However, this doesn't specify altering the core subjects or their positions relative to the shop window. 

Allowed Changes List:  
1. Real textures of the bags, clothing, and skin can be replaced with soft gradient blocks.  
2. Lighting effects can be adjusted to align with the high-end commercial style.  
3. The detailed depiction of the clothing can be simplified to clean lines and contours.  

### Step 2 - Preservation Targets List:
Thinking process: 
Core recognition elements include the two women’s postures (standing and observing the shop window), their distinct hairstyles, and the general composition of the scene (two individuals facing the shop window). Functional/logical elements include the interaction of the women with the shop window and the placement of the mannequins and bags inside the window. Remaining visual coherence involves maintaining the overall layout and the general appearance of the objects.

Preservation Targets List:  
1. The presence of two women observing the shop window.  
2. The postures and stances of the women.  
3. The shop window displaying mannequins and bags.  
4. The general position and orientation of objects in the scene.
