      "thinking_process": "The faceted star-shaped pattern is the defining decorative feature of the bottle, responsible for its unique visual identity. Its presence and geometric repetition are key to recognizing the bottle’s design. If lost in the Lego version, the bottle would appear generic and fail to match the original. This is a core identity element, hence weight 3.",
      "question": "Is the faceted star-shaped pattern covering the body of the perfume bottle preserved in the Lego version?",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The cylindrical shape with tapered sides and flat base defines the bottle’s silhouette. Altering this would change the fundamental form and make it unrecognizable as the same object. This is a core structural element, essential for identification.",
      "question": "Does the perfume bottle maintain its cylindrical shape with tapered sides and flat base in the Lego construction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The gold faceted spherical cap is a distinct component that contributes to the bottle’s elegance and design symmetry. Its shape and position are iconic. Losing it would alter the bottle’s appearance significantly.",
      "question": "Is the gold faceted spherical cap positioned at the top of the bottle preserved in the Lego version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The side-mounted spray nozzle and the visible mist plume are functional indicators of the bottle’s use. Their presence and orientation are crucial for maintaining the narrative of spraying. Removing or misplacing them breaks the logical consistency.",
      "question": "Is the spray nozzle located on the side of the bottle’s neck, with a visible mist plume extending diagonally outward, preserved in the Lego version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The undulating folds of the fabric background provide context and grounding for the bottle. Their shape and placement are essential for maintaining the scene’s composition. Changing them would disrupt the spatial relationship.",
      "question": "Are the undulating folds of the fabric background beneath the bottle preserved in form and position in the Lego version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The spatial relationship between the bottle and the fabric—specifically, the bottle resting on the fabric—is a logical anchor. If the bottle floats or is placed elsewhere, the scene loses coherence. This is an important scene element.",
      "question": "Is the perfume bottle positioned directly on top of the fabric background, maintaining contact and alignment with the folds, in the Lego version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The relative size and proportion of the cap to the bottle body are part of the design balance. If the cap is disproportionately large or small, the bottle’s aesthetic is compromised. This is a detail-level but important proportional element.",
      "question": "Is the size of the gold cap proportionally consistent with the body of the bottle in the Lego version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
