      "thinking_process": "The A-frame roof is the defining architectural feature of the cabin, distinguishing it from other house types. Its triangular shape and snow coverage are essential for recognizing the structure as a traditional alpine cabin. If this shape is altered or lost in the Impressionist rendering, the subject becomes unidentifiable. Therefore, the presence and form of the A-frame roof must be preserved.",
      "question": "Is the cabin’s roof clearly shaped as an A-frame with snow covering its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The chimney is a functional and iconic element—its location at the peak of the roof and its emission of smoke are central to the scene’s narrative of warmth and habitation. Even if rendered as a blur, the chimney must remain present and connected to the roof. Removing or relocating it would break the logical and visual integrity of the scene.",
      "question": "Is there a chimney located at the peak of the roof, from which smoke is rising?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The glowing windows are the primary source of warmth and life in the image. Their specific number (three upper, three lower) and positions are key to identifying the cabin’s layout. Losing any window or changing its placement would distort the cabin’s identity and emotional impact.",
      "question": "Are there exactly three illuminated windows on the upper level and three on the lower level, including one central window on the ground floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The log construction is a core visual identifier of the cabin type. The horizontal logs with visible gaps (chinking) define the material and style. In an Impressionist rendering, while texture may soften, the underlying structure must remain recognizable as logs. Altering this would make the cabin appear like a different building material.",
      "question": "Are the walls of the cabin constructed from visible horizontal logs with chinking between them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The surrounding fir trees create the forested context and frame the cabin. Their presence, height, and snow-covered appearance are essential for establishing the winter wilderness setting. Even if rendered with loose strokes, their form and position relative to the cabin must be preserved to maintain environmental coherence.",
      "question": "Are there tall, snow-covered evergreen fir trees surrounding the cabin on all sides?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The smoke rising from the chimney is a dynamic element indicating warmth and occupancy. While the instruction allows it to be a \"gentle blur,\" it must still originate from the chimney and rise upward. Any deviation—such as missing smoke or incorrect direction—would undermine the scene’s logic.",
      "question": "Is there smoke visibly rising vertically from the chimney into the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The glowing string lights along the eaves are a decorative detail that enhances the cozy atmosphere. Their presence adds warmth and festivity, contributing to the cabin’s charm. While their brightness or rendering may vary, their location along the roofline must be preserved to maintain visual consistency.",
      "question": "Are there glowing string lights running along the edge of the roofline beneath the eaves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "thinking_process": "The small coniferous shrubs near the porch are part of the immediate landscaping and help ground the cabin in its environment. While minor, their presence contributes to realism and depth. Removing them would simplify the scene unnecessarily.",
      "question": "Are there small snow-covered shrubs positioned on either side of the front porch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q9",
      "thinking_process": "The split-rail fence in the foreground provides spatial depth and rustic charm. It anchors the viewer’s perspective and frames the approach to the cabin. Though stylistically softened, its presence must be retained to preserve compositional balance.",
      "question": "Is there a split-rail fence partially buried in snow in the foreground, extending to the left and right of the cabin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q10",
      "thinking_process": "Falling snowflakes contribute to the wintry atmosphere and suggest ongoing weather conditions. Their presence is essential for maintaining the scene’s seasonal identity. Even in an Impressionist style, they should remain visible as scattered white specks in the air.",
      "question": "Are there visible snowflakes falling throughout the scene, particularly in the sky and around the cabin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
