      "thinking_process": "The tree’s silhouette—its wide canopy and central trunk with branching limbs—is the core identifier of the subject. Changing this would make the image unrecognizable as the same scene. Even in a diorama, the tree must retain its iconic shape to maintain visual continuity. This is a 3-point element because it defines the subject’s identity.",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the tree's central position with a wide, spreading canopy and visible branching structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The color gradient in the leaves—from green to orange and red—is a unique visual hallmark of the original image. It represents a fusion of seasons and is essential for identifying the scene. Losing this gradient would fundamentally alter the image’s character. Thus, it is a 3-point core feature.",
      "question": "Are the leaves of the tree still displaying a visible gradient from green to orange and red?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The meadow is split into two distinct zones—one pink/red with dense flowers, the other green with white daisies. This spatial division is a key compositional element. Even if flower types are adjusted, the separation must remain to preserve the original contrast. This is a 2-point element because it defines the scene’s layout.",
      "question": "Is the meadow clearly divided into a pink/red floral area on the left and a green daisy-filled area on the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The presence of white daisies on the right side of the meadow is a specific detail that anchors the scene. These flowers are identifiable and contribute to the meadow’s realism. Their removal or replacement would affect visual consistency. This is a 2-point element due to its importance in scene recognition.",
      "question": "Are white daisies still present in the green section of the meadow on the right side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The backlighting glow through the tree’s canopy creates a radiant effect, emphasizing the tree’s form and adding emotional depth. This lighting direction and effect are integral to the original mood. Even in a diorama, the glow must remain to preserve the scene’s atmosphere. This is a 2-point element because it affects the overall aesthetic.",
      "question": "Is there a visible glow or backlight effect shining through the tree’s leaves from behind?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The tree must remain grounded in the meadow, with its base embedded in soil or grass. If the tree appears floating or detached, the logical relationship between subject and environment is broken. This grounding is essential for realism and coherence. This is a 1-point element because it supports spatial logic but is less visually dominant.",
      "question": "Is the tree's base visibly rooted in the ground of the meadow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
