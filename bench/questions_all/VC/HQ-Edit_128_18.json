      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "The brown polygonal spot pattern on the giraffe's cream-colored body is the primary visual identifier distinguishing it as a giraffe. This pattern is biologically accurate and visually iconic; changing its shape, color, or distribution would make the animal unrecognizable. Since the instruction specifies using the plush giraffe as the centerpiece, this pattern must remain intact to preserve its identity. Losing this feature would render the object ambiguous or misidentified.",
      "question": "Does the giraffe retain its characteristic brown polygonal spots on a cream-colored base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The ossicones (horn-like structures) on the giraffe’s head are a defining anatomical feature that differentiates it from other animals. Their presence and shape are crucial for species identification. Altering or removing them would compromise the authenticity of the giraffe representation. As the giraffe is the centerpiece, its correct morphology must be preserved.",
      "question": "Are the two small, rounded ossicones present on top of the giraffe’s head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The giraffe’s facial expression, particularly the dark eyes and upturned mouth, contributes to its friendly and approachable appearance. This expression is part of the plush toy’s character design and helps establish emotional engagement. Changing this would alter the toy’s personality and visual identity, which is critical given its role as the centerpiece.",
      "question": "Does the giraffe have dark eyes and a slightly upturned mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The upright posture of the giraffe, standing tall and centered in the room, establishes it as the focal point of the scene. This positioning is essential for fulfilling the instruction to use it as the centerpiece. Any significant shift in orientation or stance would disrupt the intended visual hierarchy and narrative focus.",
      "question": "Is the giraffe standing upright in the center of the room?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The texture of the giraffe’s plush material—soft, fuzzy, and consistent with typical stuffed animals—is a key detail that defines its tactile quality and realism. While lighting and color might shift slightly due to editing, the underlying texture should remain identifiable. This detail supports the perception of it being a real plush toy rather than a cartoon or digital rendering.",
      "question": "Is the giraffe covered in a soft, fuzzy plush texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The rounded ears of the giraffe are a structural feature that contributes to its overall animal likeness. Their symmetrical placement and shape help distinguish it from other animals. Removing or reshaping them would distort the animal’s appearance and reduce recognizability.",
      "question": "Do the giraffe’s ears have a rounded shape and are they positioned symmetrically on either side of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The dark hooves at the ends of the giraffe’s legs are a minor but important detail that completes its realistic animal form. While less prominent than the spots or face, their presence grounds the figure in biological accuracy. Losing them could make the legs appear incomplete or unnatural.",
      "question": "Do the giraffe’s legs end in dark-colored hooves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
