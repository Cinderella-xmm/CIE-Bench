### Step 1 - Description of Reference Image and Allowed Changes List:

**Description of Reference Image:**  
The subject is a cat with a sleek and polished appearance, characterized by its upright ears, large expressive eyes, and a slightly tilted upward gaze. The cat has a smooth coat with subtle gradations in tone, and its whiskers are prominently visible. The background consists of horizontal blinds, providing a neutral backdrop that emphasizes the cat's features. The overall tone of the image is sepia, giving it a warm and sophisticated feel.

**Thinking Process:**  
The editing instructions focus on transforming the cat into a mascot for an oatmeal blend while retaining its core identity. The instructions allow for significant changes in the cat's form (e.g., converting it into a 3D chibi character) and the scene (e.g., placing it in a modern kitchen setup). However, the cat's core identity, including its sleek and polished essence, must be preserved.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
- The cat can be transformed into a 3D chibi character.
- The scene can be changed to a modern kitchen setup.
- The cat's size, proportion, and angle can be adjusted.
- The background can be replaced with a new setting.

### Step 2 - Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged:

**Thinking Process:**  
Core recognition elements include the cat's upright ears, large expressive eyes, and sleek fur texture. These features are essential for maintaining the cat's identity as the mascot. Functional/logical association elements include the cat's posture and gaze direction, which convey its inquisitive personality. Remaining elements, such as the sepia tone and the cat's whiskers, contribute to the overall visual coherence.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
- Upright ears  
- Large expressive eyes  
- Sleek fur texture  
- Posture and gaze direction  
- Whiskers
