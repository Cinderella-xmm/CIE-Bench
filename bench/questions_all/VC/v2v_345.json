      "thinking_process": "The USB-C port and speaker grilles are key functional identifiers of the smartphone model. Their presence and precise layout are critical for recognizing the device type. Since the instruction does not mention modifying the phone, these elements must remain unchanged. Losing them would alter the phone’s identity and disrupt the scene’s realism and logic. This is a core functional feature, hence weight 3.",
      "question": "Is the USB-C port located centrally on the bottom edge of the smartphone, flanked by two sets of three circular speaker holes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The smartphone’s position on the wooden surface defines the scene’s composition. Moving it would disrupt the spatial relationship with the mouse, which is central to the image’s narrative. The phone’s angle and placement are visually distinct and must be preserved for consistency. This is an important scene element, hence weight 2.",
      "question": "Is the smartphone placed diagonally on the wooden surface, with its bottom edge closer to the viewer than the top edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The wooden surface provides the primary environmental context. Its grain pattern and warm tone are distinctive and contribute to the overall realism. Altering the wood texture would change the setting’s authenticity. While not the most critical, it is a key environmental detail that supports visual coherence. Hence, weight 2.",
      "question": "Does the wooden surface display a consistent horizontal grain pattern with warm brown tones and visible wood fibers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The background is a neutral beige wall, softly blurred. It serves as a non-distracting backdrop that keeps focus on the subjects. Any change in color or clarity would shift the mood or depth perception. Though minor, it contributes to the scene’s balance and must be preserved. Weight 1.",
      "question": "Is the background a uniform beige color with a soft blur effect, providing a shallow depth of field?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The relative position of the mouse and phone is essential for maintaining the scene’s logic. The mouse is on the left, the phone on the right, both at the same level. This spatial relationship is implied by the instruction to “convert the mouse...” while keeping the phone as-is. Disrupting this would make the edit inconsistent. This is a key compositional element, hence weight 2.",
      "question": "Is the mouse positioned to the left of the smartphone, with both objects resting on the same wooden surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The mouse’s orientation — facing the phone — suggests intent or interaction. Even though its form changes, its directionality must be preserved to maintain narrative continuity. This is a secondary but meaningful detail affecting scene logic. Weight 1.",
      "question": "Is the mouse oriented such that its head is turned toward the smartphone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
