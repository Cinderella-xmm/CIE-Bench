Description of reference image: The subject is a modern bathroom setup, featuring a minimalist design. Central to the composition is a wall-mounted mirror with illuminated edges, positioned above a sleek floating vanity. The vanity has a white base with natural wood-toned countertop. On the countertop, there is a white bowl-style vessel sink fitted with a matte black faucet, accompanied by a small decorative vase with branches, a small bottle, and some folded papers. To the left, a matte black towel rack holds a gray towel. The scene is set against a clean white wall with large glass windows on the right, letting in natural light.

Thinking process:  
To determine the core recognition elements, we focus on the bathroom's minimalistic design and functional attributes, such as the mirror's shape and illumination, the sink's design, and the overall layout. Functional/logical associations include the mirror’s positioning over the sink and the consistent light source. Remaining elements like the towel rack and décor items contribute to the scene's cohesiveness and should also be retained.

Preservation Targets List:  
(Mirror's shape and illumination)  
(Vanity's design and placement)  
(Towel rack and its position relative to the wall)  
(Decorative items and their arrangement on the countertop)
