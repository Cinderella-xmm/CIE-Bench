      "thinking_process": "The subject’s facial structure—specifically the shape of the eyes, nose, and lips—is the primary identifier of her identity. Altering these would make the edited image unrecognizable as the same person. This is a core identity feature, hence weighted at 3 points.",
      "question": "Does the subject retain the original facial structure, including the shape of the eyes, nose, and lips?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The earrings are positioned on the earlobes and are integral to the subject’s appearance. Even if their design changes, their placement must remain consistent to maintain anatomical accuracy and visual coherence. This is a key accessory element, thus weighted at 2 points.",
      "question": "Are the earrings still present and attached to the earlobes on both sides of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The two braided pigtails are a defining hairstyle detail that contributes to the subject’s distinct look. Removing or altering their presence would significantly affect visual consistency. This is a secondary but identifiable feature, so it receives 2 points.",
      "question": "Are there two braids extending from the sides of the head, hanging over the shoulders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The necklace is located around the neck and features a central pendant. Its position is fixed by anatomy and must remain unchanged even if its material and design evolve. This is a key accessory placement, crucial for continuity, hence 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the necklace positioned around the neck, with a central pendant resting on the chest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The sleeveless garment with shoulder straps defines the upper body silhouette. While texture may change, the structural outline must remain to preserve the original form. This is a key garment feature, important for visual coherence, thus weighted at 2 points.",
      "question": "Does the garment remain sleeveless with wide shoulder straps extending from the shoulders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The frontal pose and direct gaze are central to the composition. Changing the angle or expression would disrupt the intended visual narrative. This is a core compositional element, vital for identity and context, so it is assigned 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the subject facing directly forward with a neutral expression, maintaining eye contact with the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The background is neutral and blurred, serving to isolate the subject. It is not specified for change, so it should remain unaltered to preserve scene consistency. This is a minor environmental detail, but its absence could affect depth perception, hence 1 point.",
      "question": "Is the background a neutral, softly blurred tone without any distinct objects or patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
