Description of reference image: The subject is a bright yellow bird perched on a small branch, facing slightly towards the right of the frame. The bird has a vivid yellow plumage covering most of its body, with subtle hints of orange on its wings and tail. Its beak is open, showing a small patch of pink inside, and its claws grip the branch firmly. The background consists of a warm, blurred forest with sunlight filtering through, creating a soft bokeh effect.

Thinking process: Analyzing the instructions, we understand that changes can be made to the background, replacing it with a city balcony railing and a city skyline. There are no alterations specified for the bird itself, implying that the bird’s appearance and posture should remain consistent. We'll derive an Allowed Changes List and Preservation Targets List accordingly.

Allowed Changes List:
- Background scene (forest replaced with a city balcony and skyline).
- Lighting (adapted to match new background setting).

Step 2 - Determine the elements that should remain unchanged:

Thinking process:
Core recognition elements: The bird's bright yellow color, open beak, orange accents on its wings and tail, and its overall posture are distinctive and must stay intact. Without them, the bird's identity would be lost.
Functional/logical association elements: The bird's position on the branch needs to be logically adapted to the new balcony setting. The branch itself may also change slightly in form or location to fit the balcony scenario, but the bird's perching action should remain unchanged.
Remaining elements: Fine details like feather texture, eye color, and the shape of the bird’s feet should also be preserved for visual coherence.

Preservation Targets List:
- Bright yellow plumage with orange accents
- Open beak and visible pink interior
- Perched posture on a support (now likely a railing)
- Feather texture and eye detail

    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The bird's bright yellow plumage with orange accents is its core identity feature. Changing this would remove its distinct appearance, making it unrecognizable.
    Question: Does the bird retain its bright yellow plumage with orange accents on its wings and tail?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The bird's posture of perching is central to the composition. While the surface it stands on may change, the action itself must remain the same to preserve the integrity of the scene.
    Question: Is the bird depicted as perched, even if on a different surface like a balcony railing?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The open beak with a visible pink interior gives the bird a specific expression that contributes significantly to its identity. Keeping this detail ensures the bird's personality remains intact.
    Question: Does the bird still have an open beak showing a pink interior?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The fine details of the bird’s feathers and eyes are secondary elements that add realism and depth to the image. They should be retained to maintain the quality and cohesiveness of the image.
    Question: Are the texture of the bird’s feathers and the details of its eye preserved?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1

{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The bird’s claw placement is essential for retaining the functional aspect of perching. It ensures the bird remains logically interacting with the new environment.
    Question: Are the bird's claws shown gripping a surface in a manner consistent with perching?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
