**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is the White Tower, a historic stone fortress located within the Tower of London complex. It is constructed from light-colored Caen limestone with alternating bands of darker stone, forming a distinct horizontal pattern. The structure features two prominent corner towers with conical roofs topped by small domes and weather vanes; one vane is clearly visible as a cross-shaped directional ornament. The building has a crenellated parapet along the top edge, characteristic of medieval military architecture. Multiple arched windows are evenly distributed across the façade—some rectangular with pointed arches, others rounded—each framed in white stone. A large arched entrance at ground level is partially obscured by a wooden drawbridge mechanism with crisscross bracing, suggesting historical defensive function. The foreground includes a grassy slope leading up to the base of the tower. To the right, a red-brick secondary building with white-framed windows and dormer-style roofing is visible. A mature tree with dense green foliage occupies the far-right edge of the frame. The sky is overcast, casting diffused lighting across the scene.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction explicitly transforms the entire composition into a **stylized 3D chateau miniaturized inside a terrarium dome**, replacing the natural landscape with moss, model knights, faux stone pathways, and a glass star atop the fortress. This indicates that:
- The **form and scale** of the fortress can be altered (e.g., reduced to miniature).
- The **materiality** of the environment (grass → moss) and **accessories** (drawbridge → model knights) are to be replaced.
- The **setting** (open sky, surrounding buildings, trees) is not required to be preserved—it will be enclosed in a terrarium.
- The **overall structure** of the fortress may be stylized or simplified, but its **iconic architectural features** must remain identifiable to maintain recognition.
- The **glass star** is an added symbolic element, not present in the original, so it's allowed to be introduced.

Thus, elements **allowed to change** include:
- Scale (miniaturization)
- Surrounding terrain (grass → moss)
- Background structures (red-brick building, tree)
- Drawbridge (replaced by model knights or other diorama elements)
- Sky (overcast → possibly clear or artificial lighting within dome)
- Presence of people or figures (if any were visible)
- Material texture of ground and walls (stone → faux stone, moss)
- Addition of new objects: glass star, terrarium dome, wooden stand

**Allowed Changes List:**
- Scale of the fortress (can be downsized)
- Terrain and ground cover (grass → moss)
- Background elements (tree, brick building, sky)
- Drawbridge structure (can be replaced or modified)
- Lighting conditions
- Addition of model knights
- Addition of faux stone pathways
- Addition of glass star on top
- Enclosure within a transparent dome
- Placement on an ornate wooden stand
- Color tone and atmosphere (to match fantastical style)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
We now identify what **must be preserved** despite transformation, based on:

1. **Core Recognition Elements**:  
   The White Tower is globally recognized by its **distinctive architectural form**: two corner towers with domed roofs, crenellated battlements, symmetrical arched windows, and the central arched entrance. These define its identity. Even if scaled down or stylized, these features must remain recognizable. For example:
   - The **two towers** with their **domed tops and weather vanes** are iconic.
   - The **arched window patterns** (especially the grouped triplets above the main level) are unique to this structure.
   - The **central arched doorway** with the wooden drawbridge is a functional and visual signature.

2. **Functional/Logical Association Elements**:  
   The **drawbridge** is not just decorative—it historically served a defensive purpose. Its presence implies access control. In the diorama, even if replaced, its **functional role** should be implied through similar placement or design logic. However, since the instruction allows replacement with "tiny model knights," we cannot assume the drawbridge itself must be retained *structurally*, but its **position and function** should be respected.

3. **Non-Modified Element Deduction**:  
   Any feature **not mentioned for modification** in the instructions must be considered part of the core identity unless it’s clearly contextual (like background). Thus:
   - The **arrangement of windows** (especially the vertical alignment and grouping) must be preserved.
   - The **corners of the towers** and their **height relative to the main body** must remain consistent.
   - The **materials' color palette** (light beige stone with white trim) should be maintained unless explicitly changed (but no such instruction exists).

However, note: the instruction says “convert... into a stylized 3D chateau,” which suggests **artistic interpretation** is permitted. But **identity retention** is still critical. Therefore, **key structural forms** must survive.

**Preservation Targets List:**
- The **two corner towers** with **domed roofs and weather vanes**
- The **crenellated parapet** along the top edge
- The **symmetrical arrangement of arched windows** (especially the triplet groupings)
- The **central arched entrance** with its **wooden drawbridge mechanism**
- The **horizontal banding pattern** of light and dark stone
- The **overall rectangular shape and massing** of the tower

These are the **minimum required** to ensure the edited image remains recognizable as the White Tower.

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The two corner towers with domed roofs and weather vanes are the most distinctive architectural features of the White Tower. Their presence and position define the structure’s identity. If either tower is removed or significantly altered in shape, the building would no longer be recognizable as the White Tower. The cross-shaped weather vane on the right tower is also a key detail, serving as a unique identifier. Therefore, preserving both towers and their crowns is essential for identity retention, making this a 3-point question.
    Question: Are both corner towers with domed roofs and weather vanes present and positioned at the upper corners of the structure?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The crenellated parapet is a defining feature of medieval fortifications and a hallmark of the White Tower. It runs continuously along the top edge and contributes to the building’s silhouette. Removing or smoothing it would fundamentally alter the structure’s appearance and historical character. Since it is not mentioned for removal in the instructions, it must be preserved. This is a core architectural element critical for recognition, hence weighted at 3 points.
    Question: Is the crenellated parapet running along the top edge of the tower intact and continuous?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The symmetrical arrangement of arched windows—particularly the triplet groups on the upper level and the single arched windows below—is a unique feature of the White Tower’s façade. These windows follow a precise pattern that distinguishes it from other towers. Altering their number, shape, or spacing would compromise the building’s identity. While the instruction allows stylization, the fundamental layout must remain. This is a key visual identifier, thus worth 3 points.
    Question: Are the arched windows arranged symmetrically across the façade, including the triplet groupings above the main level?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The central arched entrance with its wooden drawbridge is a functional and visual focal point. Even though the instruction allows replacement with model knights, the **location and form** of the entrance must remain to preserve logical continuity. The drawbridge’s crisscross bracing and position directly below the central arch are distinctive details. Changing its location or removing it entirely would disrupt the structure’s recognizability. This is a major structural feature, so it warrants 2 points.
    Question: Is there a central arched entrance at ground level, directly beneath the central section of the façade, with a wooden drawbridge structure extending forward?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The horizontal banding of light and dark stone creates a rhythmic visual pattern unique to the White Tower’s construction. This masonry technique is historically accurate and visually distinctive. While the instruction allows material changes (e.g., faux stone), the **alternating pattern** should be preserved to retain authenticity and visual coherence. Losing this pattern would make the tower appear generic. It is a significant architectural detail, so assigned 2 points.
    Question: Are there horizontal bands of alternating light and dark stone visible across the exterior walls?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The overall rectangular massing of the tower, with its tall, block-like form and two projecting towers, defines its silhouette. Any drastic alteration in proportions (e.g., squaring off corners or changing height ratio) would misrepresent the structure. While stylization is allowed, the basic shape must remain. This is a foundational geometric feature, important for recognition, hence 2 points.
    Question: Does the tower maintain a tall, rectangular mass with two prominent corner towers projecting outward?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The wooden drawbridge’s crisscross lattice pattern is a specific detail that adds realism and historical accuracy. Although the instruction allows replacement with model knights, the **structure’s form and placement** should be preserved to maintain functional logic. The diagonal bracing is a minor but identifiable feature. Its loss would reduce visual fidelity, though not identity. Thus, it is a detail-level element, worth 1 point.
    Question: Is the wooden drawbridge constructed with a crisscross lattice pattern of beams?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
