Description of reference image: The subject is a knight in full plate armor, standing in profile facing right within an arched stone gateway. The knight wears a helmet with a prominent feathered plume extending upward and backward from the top, and the armor features detailed embossing and layered construction, including articulated pauldrons, gauntlets, and greaves. A large round shield is held in the left hand, displaying a raised emblem of a rampant lion in gold and dark metal tones, set against a circular border with inscriptions or decorative patterns. The knight holds a long spear or lance in the right hand, resting diagonally on the ground. The figure stands on a cobblestone path leading through the archway into a sunlit courtyard.

The background includes a medieval castle with a tall cylindrical tower featuring crenellations, narrow slit windows, and a conical roof with a small flagpole at the peak. Additional turrets and battlements are visible in the distance under a golden-hued sky during sunrise or sunset. Ivy drapes down from the archway’s upper edge, adding greenery to the stonework. To the right of the frame, two sheep graze near a rocky outcrop. The lighting casts long shadows, emphasizing depth and texture across the scene.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions that clearly state what can be changed:  
- "Transform the armored knight and castle into a miniaturized diorama within a glass dome" → indicates the entire scene's scale, framing, and containment are altered; thus, the physical environment (archway, outdoor space) may be removed or recontextualized.  
- "Convert the knight into a detailed 3D chibi figure" → explicitly changes the form, proportion, and style of the knight, allowing for stylization (e.g., exaggerated head-to-body ratio, simplified limbs).  
- "Utilize earthy and muted tones for a medieval atmosphere" → permits color palette adjustment, but does not mandate removal of specific hues if they align with this tone.  
- "Surround the knight with tiny flocks of sheep grazing, and a sleeping dragon curled around a turret" → introduces new elements (dragon, additional sheep), implying existing animals may be retained or replaced.  

Allowed Changes List:  
- The knight’s form (transformed into chibi-style 3D figure)  
- The overall scene context (replaced by enclosed glass dome diorama)  
- Scale and perspective (miniaturized setting)  
- Addition of new elements: sleeping dragon, extra sheep flock  
- Color scheme (adjusted to earthy/muted tones)  
- Background architecture (may be reshaped as part of diorama)  

Step 2– Determine the elements that should remain unchanged  
Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements:  
- The knight's armor design, particularly the **helmet with feathered plume**, is a distinctive visual marker. Even in chibi form, the presence of this plume is essential for identifying the character as derived from the original.  
- The **rampant lion emblem on the shield** is a symbolic and iconic feature—its shape and placement must be preserved to maintain narrative identity.  
- The **spear/lance held in the right hand** serves both functional and compositional roles; its presence ensures continuity in action posture.  
- The **overall silhouette and stance** of the knight (standing upright, shield on left, weapon on right) supports logical consistency in pose.  

Functional/logical association elements:  
- The **knight’s gear configuration** (shield in left hand, spear in right) reflects combat readiness and must remain consistent unless redefined by instruction. Instruction does not override this logic, so it must be preserved.  
- The **relationship between the knight and the castle** (knight guarding or entering) implies spatial positioning—though now inside a diorama, the directional orientation (facing toward castle) should logically persist.  

Non-modified element deduction:  
After excluding allowed changes (style, scale, container, added creatures), the following visual details must be retained based on coherence and identity preservation:  
- The **feathered plume on the helmet** — unique identifier  
- The **lion emblem on the shield** — central heraldic symbol  
- The **spear held diagonally** — key accessory and pose indicator  
- The **armor’s general structure** (pauldrons, greaves, chest plate) — defines knightly identity  
- The **original position of the knight relative to the archway** — though context changes, the figure’s location within the diorama should reflect original spatial hierarchy  

Preservation Targets List:  
- The feathered plume on the knight’s helmet  
- The rampant lion emblem on the shield  
- The spear held in the knight’s right hand  
- The knight’s armor structure (including pauldrons and greaves)  
- The knight’s stance (facing right, shield on left side)  
- The castle’s turret with conical roof and flagpole  
- The ivy hanging from the archway

    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The feathered plume atop the knight’s helmet is a highly distinctive and non-replaceable visual trait. Its curved, upward-sweeping shape and contrast with the metallic helmet make it a core identification feature. In any transformation, even into chibi form, retaining this plume ensures the knight remains recognizable as the original character. Loss of this feature would result in misidentification.
    Question: Is the feathered plume still present on top of the knight's helmet?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The rampant lion emblem on the shield is a central heraldic symbol and one of the most identifiable features of the original image. It is intricately designed with specific posture (upright, front paws raised) and metallic finish. This detail is crucial for maintaining the knight’s identity and narrative significance. Removing or altering it would undermine the thematic consistency.
    Question: Is the rampant lion emblem clearly visible on the shield?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The spear held in the knight’s right hand is a functional object tied directly to the knight’s pose and role. Its diagonal placement across the body contributes to the composition and balance. While the chibi version may simplify it, the presence and orientation of the spear must be preserved to retain the original action and intent.
    Question: Is the knight holding a long spear or lance in their right hand?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The knight’s armor includes distinct components such as articulated pauldrons and greaves, which define the character’s appearance. These structural elements distinguish the knight from generic fantasy figures. Even in stylized form, these parts must be recognizable to preserve authenticity.
    Question: Are the knight's pauldrons and greaves visibly present in the armor?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2

{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The castle’s turret with its conical roof and flagpole is a defining architectural feature of the background. It provides contextual depth and historical authenticity. Though scaled down in the diorama, its shape and placement must remain intact to maintain scene recognition.
    Question: Is the castle's main turret with a conical roof and flagpole still visible?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The ivy hanging from the archway adds organic texture and environmental detail to the scene. It enhances realism and ties the natural world to the stone structure. While not central to the knight’s identity, its presence contributes to visual coherence and should be preserved in the diorama setting.
    Question: Are strands of ivy hanging down from the top of the archway?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}
{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The knight’s stance—facing right with shield on the left and spear on the right—is critical for maintaining the original composition and narrative direction. This posture establishes spatial logic and focus. Any deviation would disrupt the intended visual flow.
    Question: Is the knight positioned facing toward the right side of the image, with the shield on the left arm?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
