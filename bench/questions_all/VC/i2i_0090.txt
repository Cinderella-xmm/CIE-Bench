Description of reference image: The subject is a blue stapler placed on a green circular pedestal against a uniform green background. The stapler has a metallic hinge mechanism, a visible stapling slot, and a small silver screw. It features a sleek, modern design with a matte finish, complemented by a light blue strip on the top surface for added visual appeal.

Thinking process:  
Analyzing the instructions, we will create a side-by-side comparison of the stapler's front and rear views. This implies that the following aspects can be altered:
- The angle of the stapler (to show the rear view).
- The positioning on the pedestal (to accommodate two staplers side by side).

Allowed Changes List:
- The angle of the stapler to display its rear side.
- The arrangement of the stapler on the pedestal to present both views.

Step 2 - Determine the elements that should remain unchanged:

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements include the unique blue color, the metallic hinge, and the overall shape of the stapler. These features are crucial for recognizing it even when viewed from different angles. Functional/logical elements like the stapling mechanismâ€™s functionality and position relative to the body must also stay intact. Additional visual coherence details, like the green background and pedestal, should remain consistent.

Preservation Targets List: 
- Blue color and overall shape of the stapler.
- Metallic hinge and stapling slot placement.
- Light blue strip on the top.
- Green background and pedestal.
