      "thinking_process": "The central waterfall is the dominant vertical feature and core identity of the scene. Its position, height, and downward flow define the composition. Even if transformed into a holographic projection, its spatial placement and direction must remain unchanged to preserve scene recognition. This is a key structural and visual anchor, so loss would make the scene unrecognizable.",
      "question": "Is the central waterfall positioned vertically in the middle of the image, descending from the upper cliff to the river below?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The twisted tree on the left is a distinctive morphological feature—its diagonal sweep, gnarled trunk, and flower clusters create a unique silhouette. This tree serves as a visual landmark and must retain its shape and position to maintain consistency with the original. Changing its form would disrupt the scene’s balance and identity.",
      "question": "Is there a large, curved tree on the left side of the image with a diagonal branch extending upward and bearing clusters of small purple flowers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The river flows from the bottom of the image toward the base of the waterfall, forming a continuous path. This directional flow is essential for spatial logic and narrative continuity. Even if rendered digitally, the river must follow the same course to maintain environmental coherence.",
      "question": "Does the river originate in the foreground and curve toward the base of the central waterfall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The rocky riverbed with visible stones contributes to the naturalistic detail of the scene. While materials may change, the presence and arrangement of rocks along the riverbank help ground the composition. Their absence would remove a key textural element tied to the original.",
      "question": "Are there visible rocks scattered along the riverbed in the foreground and midground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The two secondary waterfalls on the right cliff are part of the background depth structure. They provide scale and reinforce the sense of a vast landscape. Their presence and relative position to the main waterfall are important for spatial context and must be retained.",
      "question": "Are there two smaller waterfalls visible on the right-hand cliff face, behind the main waterfall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The canopy overhead with light filtering through creates a dappled lighting effect and frames the scene. This top-down light structure is a key atmospheric feature. Even in a holographic version, the light entry points and canopy shape must align with the original to preserve the mood and perspective.",
      "question": "Is there a dense canopy at the top of the image with sunlight streaming through gaps, creating bright patches on the foliage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The purple flowers on the left tree are a specific, localized detail that adds color contrast and botanical accuracy. Their retention ensures fidelity to the original flora and prevents oversimplification of the ecosystem depicted.",
      "question": "Are there small purple flowers growing on the left side of the twisted tree, near the base of its branches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "thinking_process": "The layered mountain range in the background establishes depth and scale. While stylized, the silhouette and gradient fade into the distance must remain to preserve the landscape’s grandeur and spatial logic.",
      "question": "Are there multiple mountain ridges receding into the background, fading into a hazy blue sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
