### Step 1 - Analyzing Allowed Changes and Determining Reference Image Details

**Description of reference image:** The image showcases St. Basil's Cathedral in Moscow, characterized by its distinctive onion-shaped domes in vibrant colors like blue, green, red, and gold. The cathedral has a complex structure with multiple towers and spires, each adorned with intricate patterns and crosses. In the background, there is a clear blue sky with scattered clouds, and a colorful hot air balloon floats nearby. The scene is bright and sunny, emphasizing the vivid colors of both the cathedral and the balloon.

**Thinking process:** The editing instructions specify transforming the architecture into an anime-style badge while retaining certain elements. The badge should mirror the vibrant domes and intricate patterns of the cathedral. The scene and background are not explicitly required to be retained, allowing for significant changes in those areas. However, the badge must reflect the core architectural features of the cathedral.

**Allowed Changes List:**
- The scene and background can be altered significantly.
- The form of the architecture can be transformed into a circular badge.
- The material can be changed to tassel.
- The presentation can include a hand holding the badge.

### Step 2 - Determining Elements That Should Remain Unchanged

**Thinking process:** Core recognition elements include the vibrant colors and intricate patterns of the domes, as these are iconic features of St. Basil's Cathedral. Functional/logical association elements involve the badge reflecting these features accurately. Remaining elements, such as the overall shape and arrangement of the domes, should also be retained for visual coherence.

**Preservation Targets List:**
- Vibrant colors of the domes (blue, green, red, gold).
- Intricate patterns on the domes.
- Overall shape and arrangement of the domes.
- Crosses atop the spires.
