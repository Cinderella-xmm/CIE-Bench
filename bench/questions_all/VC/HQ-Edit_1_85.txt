Description of reference image: The subject is a young girl with long, straight dark brown hair and bangs, positioned in profile facing left. She is holding a violin under her chin with her left hand on the neck and right hand poised to draw the bow (though the bow is not visible). Her attire consists of a white blouse with lace detailing at the cuffs and collar, paired with a black pleated skirt. The blouse has puffed sleeves and delicate embroidery along the edges. The violin is a classic wooden instrument with a rich brown finish, visible f-holes, and a scroll at the end. The background features soft, diffused light coming through an arched window framed by cream-colored curtains. To the right, a small wooden table holds a golden candlestick with a bundle of reeds or quills inserted into it, suggesting a classical or scholarly setting. The overall lighting is warm and ethereal, emphasizing the girl’s serene expression and the elegant composition.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions word by word. The instruction states: “Transform the girl into a series of art postcards, using a paper-cut style with intricate lace detailing on her blouse.” This indicates that the **artistic medium** and **style** are being changed—specifically, the rendering technique becomes paper-cut, but the **subject identity** remains the same (the girl). It also says: “Enlarge the violin and refine her elegant pose to emphasize musical expression,” meaning the **size and posture** can be altered. Then: “Print on textured cream stock, with postcard backs featuring blank music sheet motifs for notes,” which describes the **final product format**, not the visual content itself. Therefore, changes allowed include:
- Artistic style (paper-cut)
- Size of violin
- Pose refinement
- Medium/format (postcard printing)

However, the instruction does **not** say to change the **identity** of the girl, the **core clothing elements**, the **presence of the violin**, or the **scene logic** (e.g., the girl playing the violin). Thus, any element not explicitly mentioned as modifiable must be retained if it contributes to core recognition or functional coherence.

Allowed Changes List:
- Artistic style (transformed into paper-cut aesthetic)
- Violin size (enlarged)
- Girl’s pose (refined for musical expression)
- Final output format (postcard print on cream stock with music sheet back)
- Visual texture and rendering (from realistic to stylized)

Step 2 - Determine the elements that should remain unchanged

Thinking process:
Core recognition elements: The girl's identity is defined by her **distinctive hairstyle** (long straight dark hair with bangs), **facial features** (small nose, large eyes, gentle expression), and **clothing silhouette** (white blouse with lace, black pleated skirt). These are essential to maintaining the subject’s recognizability. Even though the style changes to paper-cut, the **basic form** of these features must remain to preserve identity.

Functional/logical association elements: The girl is interacting with the violin—this action defines the scene. Although the violin may be enlarged, its **presence** and **function** (held under chin, fingers on neck) must be preserved. The **pose** may be refined, but the **action of playing** must remain logically consistent. Also, the **relationship between the girl and the violin** (instrument held correctly) must not break functionality.

Non-modified element deduction: After excluding allowed changes (style, size, pose refinement), remaining elements include:
- The **texture and pattern of the lace** on the blouse (though style may change, the presence of lace detail must persist)
- The **color scheme** of white blouse and black skirt (unless specified otherwise)
- The **overall composition** of the girl in front of the arched window
- The **golden candlestick** and **reeds/quills** on the table (as part of the scene context)
- The **arched window shape** and **light source direction**

These are not mentioned as changeable, so they must be retained for visual consistency and narrative coherence.

Preservation Targets List:
- The girl’s long dark hair with bangs
- The white blouse with lace detailing at the cuffs and collar
- The black pleated skirt
- The violin held under the chin with left hand on neck
- The arched window with soft backlighting
- The golden candlestick with reeds/quills on the table
- The position and orientation of the girl relative to the window and table

Q1:  
Thinking process: The girl’s long dark hair with bangs is a key facial and stylistic identifier. It distinguishes her from other characters and contributes significantly to her recognizable appearance. Even in a paper-cut style, the **shape and length** of the hair must remain intact to preserve identity. If the hair were shortened or styled differently, the character would no longer be identifiable as the original subject. This is a core recognition feature, thus weighted at 3 points.  
Question: Is the girl’s long dark hair with bangs present and extending past her shoulders?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The white blouse with lace detailing at the cuffs and collar is a distinctive garment feature. The lace is specifically mentioned in the instruction as a detail to be enhanced, implying it must exist. Its presence is critical for maintaining the character’s visual identity and elegance. Changing or removing the lace would contradict both the original image and the editing intent. This is a core design element, hence 3 points.  
Question: Does the blouse have visible lace trim along the cuffs and collar?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The black pleated skirt is a defining part of the outfit and contrasts sharply with the white blouse. It anchors the figure visually and contributes to the formal, classical aesthetic. Altering the color or removing the pleats would disrupt the balance and identity of the attire. While the style may shift to paper-cut, the **form and color** of the skirt must remain. This is a core component of the outfit, so it carries 3 points.  
Question: Is the girl wearing a black pleated skirt that extends below the waistline?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The violin is central to the scene’s theme—musical expression. Although the instruction allows enlargement, the **presence** and **correct positioning** (under chin, held by left hand) are essential for logical coherence. Removing or misplacing the violin would break the narrative function of the image. Even in a stylized version, the instrument must retain its basic shape and placement. This is a functional and iconic element, therefore 3 points.  
Question: Is the violin positioned under the girl’s chin with her left hand on the neck?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The arched window with soft backlighting creates the primary lighting and atmosphere. It defines the spatial context and mood of the scene. The instruction does not mention changing the background or lighting structure, so this architectural feature must remain. Its shape and light direction contribute to the composition’s harmony. This is a key environmental element, thus 2 points.  
Question: Is there an arched window behind the girl emitting soft, diffused light?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The golden candlestick with reeds or quills on the table adds cultural and thematic depth—suggesting study, artistry, or tradition. Though not the focal point, it is a specific object in the original scene. Since the instruction does not mention removing it, and it supports the setting’s authenticity, it must be preserved. Its absence would reduce contextual richness. This is an important secondary detail, so 2 points.  
Question: Is there a golden candlestick with a bundle of reeds or quills on a wooden table to the right of the girl?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The girl’s facial expression—calm, focused, slightly downward gaze—is crucial for conveying emotional tone. It reflects concentration and serenity during music-making. Even in a stylized paper-cut version, the **direction of gaze** and **expression** must remain consistent to preserve the mood. This is a subtle but significant detail affecting the narrative, thus 1 point.  
Question: Is the girl looking slightly downward with a calm and focused expression?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q8:  
Thinking process: The lace detailing on the blouse is emphasized in the instruction (“intricate lace detailing”), meaning it must be present and prominent. While the style may become paper-cut, the **texture and pattern** of the lace must still be discernible. Losing this detail would contradict the instruction and reduce authenticity. This is a minor but intentional detail, hence 1 point.  
Question: Are there visible lace patterns on the sleeve cuffs and collar of the blouse?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1
