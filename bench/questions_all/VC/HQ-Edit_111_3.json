      "thinking_process": "The iridescent electric blue color of the butterfly’s wings is the most iconic and biologically defining feature of the Morpho species. It is responsible for the butterfly’s recognition in both nature and art. If this color is altered (e.g., desaturated, shifted to purple or green), the butterfly loses its identity. The instruction emphasizes preserving the \"striking color as a focal point,\" so this feature must remain unmodified. This is a core identity element, hence weighted at 3 points.",
      "question": "Does the butterfly retain its original iridescent electric blue wing color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The black border around the wings is a consistent morphological trait of the Morpho butterfly and contributes significantly to its visual distinction from other species. Removing or lightening this border would make the butterfly appear unnatural or misidentified. Since no instruction allows altering wing outlines, this feature must be preserved. It is a core structural identifier, thus weighted at 3 points.",
      "question": "Are the dark black edges along the outer margins of the butterfly’s wings preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The butterfly is shown with wings fully spread and symmetrically aligned, which is crucial for displaying its full coloration and anatomical structure. Any folding, tilting, or asymmetry would misrepresent its natural resting state and hinder accurate biological representation. The instruction requires the butterfly as the central focus, implying its full display. This posture is essential for identification and educational clarity, so it must remain unchanged. Weighted at 3 points as a core identity feature.",
      "question": "Is the butterfly depicted with both wings fully extended and symmetrically open?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The pink cosmos flower serves as both a visual anchor and ecological context. Its presence under the butterfly illustrates feeding behavior and pollination dynamics. The instruction specifically mentions including \"pink petals\" to show feeding preference, meaning the flower must remain visually present. Altering its color, removing it, or replacing it with another plant would break the intended ecological narrative. This is a key scene element, so it must be retained. Weighted at 2 points as an important contextual element.",
      "question": "Is the bright pink cosmos flower directly beneath the butterfly still present and clearly visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The yellow central disc of the flower, composed of stamens, is a critical botanical detail indicating the reproductive structure of the cosmos. It provides evidence of the flower’s role in pollination. The instruction references the butterfly’s ecological role, making this feature relevant. Removing or altering it would mislead viewers about the flower’s biology. While not the most prominent feature, it is a key detail for scientific accuracy. Weighted at 2 points as an important functional detail.",
      "question": "Are the yellow stamens forming the central disc of the pink flower visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The physical contact between the butterfly and the flower is essential for illustrating the pollination interaction. The butterfly’s legs or body touching the flower surface reinforces the ecological relationship described in the instruction. If this contact is removed or obscured, the logical connection between the butterfly and the flower is broken. Though not a core identity feature, it is a functional and compositional necessity. Weighted at 2 points for maintaining scene logic.",
      "question": "Is the butterfly physically touching the surface of the pink flower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The unopened pink buds surrounding the main flower provide environmental context and reinforce the idea of a thriving ecosystem. They contribute to the botanical richness of the scene and support the theme of floral diversity. Although not the primary focus, their presence adds depth and realism. The instruction mentions \"botanical details,\" which includes such elements. Removing them would reduce visual coherence and ecological authenticity. This is a minor but supportive detail, so it is weighted at 1 point.",
      "question": "Are multiple unopened pink flower buds visible around the main flower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "thinking_process": "The soft-focus green foliage in the background establishes the natural habitat and enhances depth perception. While the instruction does not require strict preservation of the background, it does emphasize keeping the visual theme \"delicate\" and focused on the butterfly. Disrupting the background with sharp lines or artificial textures could distract from the subject. Therefore, the general green tone and blurred leaf shapes should remain consistent. This is a secondary environmental detail, so it is weighted at 1 point.",
      "question": "Is the background composed of softly blurred green leaves, maintaining a natural garden ambiance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
