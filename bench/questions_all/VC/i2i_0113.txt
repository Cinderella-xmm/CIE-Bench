Description of reference image: The subject is a character wearing a detailed tactical suit, predominantly black with red straps across the shoulders and arms. The suit has intricate textures and multiple pockets with belts, emphasizing its functional design. The character's chest armor appears reinforced, and the outfit suggests readiness for combat. The character has red hair styled in loose waves, and the background is intentionally blurred to keep focus on the character.

### Step 1 - Analyze Editing Instructions and Allowed Changes

**Thinking process:** The instructions mention designing a soft vinyl figure, which implies transforming the 3D-rendered character into a toy-like figure. The instructions also specify that the figure should stand on a black base with interchangeable accessories. This means:

- **Subject transformation:** The character’s current human form will be adapted into a vinyl figure form.
- **Background alteration:** The current background will be replaced with a new setting involving a black base.
- **Accessories addition:** Additional elements like weapons and hand gestures will be introduced and must be interchangeable.

**Allowed Changes List:**
- Overall form and size of the character to fit the vinyl figure format.
- Background environment to a simple base setup suitable for a vinyl figure display.
- Addition of accessories like weapons and interchangeable hand gestures.

### Step 2 - Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged

**Thinking process:** The core recognition elements for the character include distinctive attributes like the tactical suit design, the red hair texture, and the character’s pose. Functional elements like the suit's structure and pockets should stay intact for the character’s identity and logical association. 

**Preservation Targets List:**
- Tactical suit design and textures (core recognition).
- Red hair style and color (iconic visual symbol).
- Functional design elements like pockets and belts (logical association with the character's role).
- Character’s general pose (maintaining the original impression).
