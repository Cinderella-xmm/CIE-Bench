      "thinking_process": "The girl’s long dark hair with bangs is a key facial and stylistic identifier. It distinguishes her from other characters and contributes significantly to her recognizable appearance. Even in a paper-cut style, the **shape and length** of the hair must remain intact to preserve identity. If the hair were shortened or styled differently, the character would no longer be identifiable as the original subject. This is a core recognition feature, thus weighted at 3 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The white blouse with lace detailing at the cuffs and collar is a distinctive garment feature. The lace is specifically mentioned in the instruction as a detail to be enhanced, implying it must exist. Its presence is critical for maintaining the character’s visual identity and elegance. Changing or removing the lace would contradict both the original image and the editing intent. This is a core design element, hence 3 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The black pleated skirt is a defining part of the outfit and contrasts sharply with the white blouse. It anchors the figure visually and contributes to the formal, classical aesthetic. Altering the color or removing the pleats would disrupt the balance and identity of the attire. While the style may shift to paper-cut, the **form and color** of the skirt must remain. This is a core component of the outfit, so it carries 3 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The violin is central to the scene’s theme—musical expression. Although the instruction allows enlargement, the **presence** and **correct positioning** (under chin, held by left hand) are essential for logical coherence. Removing or misplacing the violin would break the narrative function of the image. Even in a stylized version, the instrument must retain its basic shape and placement. This is a functional and iconic element, therefore 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the violin positioned under the girl’s chin with her left hand on the neck?",

      "thinking_process": "The arched window with soft backlighting creates the primary lighting and atmosphere. It defines the spatial context and mood of the scene. The instruction does not mention changing the background or lighting structure, so this architectural feature must remain. Its shape and light direction contribute to the composition’s harmony. This is a key environmental element, thus 2 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The golden candlestick with reeds or quills on the table adds cultural and thematic depth—suggesting study, artistry, or tradition. Though not the focal point, it is a specific object in the original scene. Since the instruction does not mention removing it, and it supports the setting’s authenticity, it must be preserved. Its absence would reduce contextual richness. This is an important secondary detail, so 2 points.",
      "question": "Is there a golden candlestick with a bundle of reeds or quills on a wooden table to the right of the girl?",

Even in a stylized paper-cut version, the **direction of gaze** and **expression** must remain consistent to preserve the mood.

While the style may become paper-cut, the **texture and pattern** of the lace must still be discernible. Losing this detail would contradict the instruction and reduce authenticity. This is a minor but intentional detail, hence 1 point.",
