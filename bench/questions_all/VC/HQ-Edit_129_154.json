Their **presence, symmetry, and detailed design** are essential to maintaining visual coherence. If these patterns are absent or altered beyond recognition, the transformation loses its grounding in the original object. Therefore, this is a core identity feature.",
      "question": "Are the floral and foliate engraved patterns visible on the body of the transformed owl, arranged symmetrically between vertical ribs?",

      "thinking_process": "The reflective metallic surface defines the teapot’s materiality and is crucial to its aesthetic. The instruction describes a \"mechanical owl,\" which implies a similar metallic texture. Losing this reflective quality would fundamentally alter the material identity of the subject, making it inconsistent with the original. Thus, the **shiny, polished silver tone** must be preserved.",
      "question": "Does the transformed owl retain a shiny, polished metallic surface consistent with the original teapot’s finish?",

      "thinking_process": "The spout’s curved shape is specified to become the beak. Its **direction, curvature, and length** are key to the transformation’s logic. If the beak is straight or blunt, it breaks the morphological link. Therefore, the **original spout’s silhouette** must be preserved.",
      "question": "Is the beak of the mechanical owl shaped like the original teapot’s curved spout, extending forward and slightly upward?",

      "thinking_process": "The handle’s C-shaped curve is described as becoming the tail. This **flowing, ornamental arc** is distinctive and must be preserved to ensure continuity. A rigid or straight tail would break the transformation logic.",
      "question": "Does the tail of the mechanical owl follow the same graceful C-shaped curve as the original teapot’s handle?",

      "thinking_process": "The lid’s finial is a distinctive architectural feature, and the instruction refers to it as forming a \"crown-like head.\" Its **pointed, tiered shape** is essential to the crown motif. If lost, the head loses its regal character and connection to the original.",
      "question": "Does the crown-like head of the mechanical owl include a pointed, tiered finial matching the original teapot’s lid top?",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The vertical ribbing divides the body into panels, each containing a motif. This **segmented structure** is a key design feature. The instruction implies these segments become feather sections, so their **arrangement and number** must be preserved.",
      "question": "Are the body segments of the mechanical owl divided into vertical ribs, each housing a decorative motif, mirroring the original teapot’s structure?",

Since the handle becomes the tail, this detail may appear at the tail’s tip. Its **presence and style** help maintain visual fidelity.",

      "thinking_process": "The dark brown color of the handle suggests either aged wood or dark metal. In the transformation, if the tail is made from the same material, its **color tone** should match to preserve material consistency. While not strictly required, it supports visual coherence.",
      "question": "Is the tail of the mechanical owl rendered in a dark brown tone consistent with the original handle’s color?",
