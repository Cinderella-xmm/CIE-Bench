      "thinking_process": "The dark gray to black fur coloration is a core identification feature of the gorilla. This coloration distinguishes it from other primates and is essential for recognizing the animal as a gorilla. In the edited image, even if stylized, the fur must retain this dark tone to maintain species identity. Losing this would make the figure unrecognizable as a gorilla, hence it is a critical element with a weight of 3 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The dark facial skin, especially around the eyes, nose, and mouth, is a distinctive trait of gorillas. It contrasts sharply with the fur and helps define the facial structure. This feature is crucial for accurate species recognition. If absent or altered significantly, the figure might resemble another primate. Thus, it is a key identifying element with a weight of 3 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The broad, muscular chest and defined pectoral muscles are hallmark features of a silverback gorilla, indicating dominance and strength. These anatomical details are essential for conveying the correct species and gender. Even in a stylized form, the general mass and shape of the chest must be preserved to maintain realism and identity. This is a significant structural feature, warranting a weight of 2 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The presence of a lighter-colored patch on the back and shoulders (the silver saddle) is a defining trait of adult male gorillas. Although partially obscured in some views, its existence is implied by the subject’s status as a silverback. This feature is critical for identifying the individual as a dominant male. Its absence would misrepresent the subject, making it a high-priority retention element with a weight of 3 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The facial structure, including the broad nose and pronounced brow ridges, contributes to the gorilla’s unique appearance. These features are not just aesthetic but functional in species identification. Altering them could lead to confusion with other apes. While stylization may simplify them, their essence must remain. This is a key facial identifier, thus assigned a weight of 2 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The posture of the gorilla—standing upright with hands on chest and mouth open—is a signature dominance display. While the instruction allows for transformation, the intent behind the pose (strength, power) should be preserved in the stylized version. The hand placement on the chest is a specific detail that conveys this behavior. Retaining this gesture ensures continuity in the character’s expression, making it a meaningful detail with a weight of 2 points.",
