### Step 1 - Description of Reference Image and Allowed Changes List:

**Description of Reference Image:**  
The image depicts a green clock tower with a hexagonal structure, featuring a large clock face with Roman numerals. The tower has two flags with green and yellow stripes on either side. The background consists of a bright blue sky with scattered white clouds. The architectural details include a balcony with balusters below the clock face and a pointed roof above.

**Thinking Process:**  
The editing instructions specify transforming the scene into a winter setting by adding snow and replacing the flags with icy patterns. This means the texture and appearance of the tower and its surroundings can be altered to reflect a snowy environment. However, the fundamental structure and design of the clock tower must remain intact.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
1. Add snow on the clock tower and surrounding area.
2. Replace the flags with icy patterns.
3. Adjust the background to match a winter setting.

### Step 2 - Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged:

**Thinking Process:**  
Core recognition elements include the clock tower's hexagonal shape, the clock face with Roman numerals, and the overall architectural design. Functional/logical elements involve the positioning of the clock face and the structural integrity of the tower. Remaining elements like the balcony and roof design should also be retained for visual coherence.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
1. Hexagonal shape of the clock tower.
2. Clock face with Roman numerals.
3. Architectural details like the balcony and roof.
4. Structural integrity and positioning of the clock face.
5. Green and yellow color scheme of the tower (excluding the flags).
