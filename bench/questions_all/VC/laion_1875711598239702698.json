      "thinking_process": "The upward-curved trunk is a core identification feature of the elephants in the original image. It defines the posture and directionality of the figure and is central to the stylized representation. Even when transformed into a fragrance bottle, the trunk’s curve must be preserved to maintain the visual link to the original subject. Losing this shape would make the transformation unrecognizable as an elephant-derived design.",
      "question": "Is the trunk of each elephant still curved upward in the same manner as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The large, flared ears are iconic to the elephant’s profile and are specifically referenced in the editing instruction as being repurposed into \"gold-trimmed caps.\" This indicates the ear shape must be preserved in form, even if functionally reimagined. The outline and position of the ears are critical to maintaining the elephant identity.",
      "question": "Are the ears of both elephants still present in their original flared shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The mosaic-like pattern on the back is a distinctive decorative feature that differentiates these elephants from others. Its oval shape, central placement, and golden border are key design elements. The instruction mentions converting this into a glass mosaic, which implies the **shape and location** must be retained, even if texture changes. Removing or relocating it would break the visual continuity.",
      "question": "Is the oval-shaped mosaic pattern located on the back of each elephant, centered and bordered by gold trim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The golden tusks are small but significant details that reinforce the elephant’s identity. Their presence, color, and placement near the mouth are consistent across both figures. While the instruction allows material changes, the **presence and position** of the tusks must be preserved to maintain fidelity to the original design.",
      "question": "Do both elephants retain golden-colored tusks positioned near the mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The decorative band with scrollwork at the base is a consistent stylistic element across both figures. It contributes to the ornamental quality and helps define the lower edge of the body. Although the instruction allows material transformation, the **band’s presence and pattern** must remain to preserve the design language.",
      "question": "Is there a decorative band with scrollwork pattern around the lower body of each elephant?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The eye placement and dark coloring are essential for facial recognition and expression. The eyes are clearly defined and positioned on the sides of the head, contributing to the overall character of the figurines. Changing their position or removing them would alter the identity of the subject.",
      "question": "Are the eyes of both elephants positioned on the sides of the head and colored dark?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The relative size difference between the two elephants (larger and smaller) suggests a parent-offspring relationship or a pair. This proportional relationship is visually important for composition and narrative. The instruction does not mention resizing, so the **size ratio** should be preserved to maintain balance and context.",
      "question": "Is the larger elephant positioned to the left and the smaller one to the right, maintaining their original relative size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
