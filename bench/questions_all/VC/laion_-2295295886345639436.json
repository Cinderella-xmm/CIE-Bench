      "thinking_process": "The open mouth with visible teeth and tongue is a core facial feature that defines the character's aggressive expression. It is a key identifier of the original image's emotional tone and character identity. Since the instruction mandates the head remain consistent, this specific detail must be preserved. Loss of this feature would fundamentally alter the character’s expression and make it unrecognizable from the original.",
      "question": "Is the mouth wide open in a roaring expression with visible teeth and tongue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The narrowed, intense eyes are essential to the character's fierce demeanor. They are part of the facial expression that must remain unchanged according to the instruction. Altering their shape or openness would break the consistency of the head, affecting the character's identity across transformations.",
      "question": "Are the eyes narrowed and focused, indicating anger or exertion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The balding top of the head with side hair is a distinctive feature of the character's appearance. This hair pattern contributes to the unique silhouette of the head and is part of the head's identity. Since the head must remain consistent, this specific hair distribution must be retained.",
      "question": "Does the head have a balding crown with hair along the sides and back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The jawline and chin structure define the character’s facial shape and contribute to the aggressive, masculine appearance. This anatomical feature is part of the head and must remain consistent per the instruction. Changing it would result in a different facial identity.",
      "question": "Is the jawline strong and angular, with a defined chin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The head is positioned directly above the torso, centered and upright, which maintains the anatomical relationship and visual balance. This spatial relationship is critical for preserving the character’s identity across transformations. Even if the body changes, the head must remain in this relative position.",
      "question": "Is the head located at the top center of the figure, aligned with the spine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The facial hair (if present) or lack thereof is a minor but identifiable detail. In this case, there appears to be no beard, only a clean-shaven face with defined cheekbones. Retaining this absence of facial hair ensures consistency in the head’s appearance. While not as critical as the mouth or eyes, it contributes to the overall facial identity.",
      "question": "Is the face clean-shaven, without a beard or mustache?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
