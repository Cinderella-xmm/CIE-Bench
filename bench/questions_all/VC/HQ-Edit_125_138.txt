**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a Balinese dancer in a dynamic, mid-performance pose, positioned centrally in the foreground. She wears an elaborate golden headdress with upward-curving elements resembling flames or stylized feathers, adorned with red accents and small decorative beads. Her face is painted white with darkened eyes and red lips, characteristic of traditional Balinese dance makeup. She wears a long, flowing orange-red dress with gold embroidery and a prominent gold sash across her torso, featuring intricate patterns and a dangling tassel-like ornament at the back. Her arms are gracefully extended in a classical dance gesture, with one hand raised near her head and the other outstretched forward. The background features a multi-tiered Balinese temple (pura) with dark gray stone tiers and ornate carvings, rising vertically toward the sky. On either side of the dancer stand large, symmetrical mythical creatures (barong-like figures), carved from wood or stone, with fierce facial expressions, wide-open mouths, sharp teeth, and detailed horned heads. These creatures are mounted on pedestals, each flanked by smaller seated statues. The environment is lush with tropical trees and flowering branches bearing pink blossoms, set under a warm golden sunset sky with soft light illuminating the scene.

Thinking process:  
The editing instructions specify several transformations:
- **Stylize the dress** with intricate golden batik patterns and vibrant reds → implies changes to texture and color of the dress.
- **Simplify the temple structure into detailed line-drawn illustrations in sepia tones** → indicates that the temple’s form must be preserved but its rendering style changed.
- **Compose the scene with the temple in the center as the focus**, while balancing the mythical creatures symmetrically → confirms the spatial layout must remain intact.
- **Integrate informative text about Balinese dance and architecture** → introduces new content not present originally.
- **Ensure cultural authenticity and clarity** → suggests preservation of culturally significant visual cues.

From this, we can deduce:
- The **dress design** may be altered in pattern and color (but not removed).
- The **temple's architectural form** must remain recognizable, though rendered in line art.
- The **mythical creatures' positions and symmetry** must be preserved.
- The **overall composition** (central temple, flanking creatures, dancer in front) must stay.
- The **dancer’s posture and identity** must remain intact, including key costume elements like the headdress and makeup.
- **Text addition** is allowed and does not affect core visual elements.

Allowed Changes List:
- Dress pattern and color (specifically batik motifs and red/gold palette)
- Rendering style of the temple (from realistic 3D to line-drawing in sepia)
- Addition of educational text
- Background lighting tone (as long as it supports the mood)
- Texture of clothing (e.g., fabric sheen replaced with flat batik style)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements must be retained because they define the subject’s identity and cultural context:
- The **dancer’s headdress** is iconic—its flame-like shape and placement are central to Balinese ceremonial dance; changing it would alter the cultural identity.
- The **face paint** (white base, dark eyes, red lips) is a hallmark of traditional Balinese performance; altering it would misrepresent the culture.
- The **posture** of the dancer (arms extended, one leg bent, body angled) is a signature movement in Balinese dance; losing this undermines authenticity.
- The **temple’s tiered structure** (multi-level, stepped roof with upturned eaves) is architecturally unique to Balinese Hindu temples; its silhouette must be preserved even if stylized.
- The **symmetrical placement of the barong-like creatures** is essential for compositional balance and cultural symbolism; their position and orientation must remain unchanged.
- The **presence of smaller seated statues** beneath the creatures contributes to the ritualistic setting and should not be removed.

Functional/logical association elements:
- The **spatial relationship** between the dancer and the temple (dancer in front, temple behind) establishes narrative logic—she performs before the sacred site. This cannot change without disrupting meaning.
- The **mythical creatures flank the path**, serving as guardians; removing or repositioning them breaks the symbolic entranceway.

Non-modified element deduction:
After excluding allowed changes (dress pattern, temple rendering), remaining details such as:
- The **headdress’s crown-like top**
- The **dancer’s jewelry** (necklace, bracelets)
- The **texture of the temple’s stonework**
- The **expression and open mouth of the creatures**
must be retained for visual coherence and cultural accuracy.

Preservation Targets List:
- The dancer’s headdress with flame-shaped upper elements
- The dancer’s face paint (white skin, dark eyes, red lips)
- The dancer’s dance posture (arm extension, body angle)
- The temple’s multi-tiered pagoda structure
- The symmetrical positioning of the two large mythical creatures
- The presence of smaller seated statues beneath the creatures
- The dancer’s jewelry (necklace and bracelets)
- The temple’s central position in the composition

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The flame-shaped headdress is a core identifier of Balinese ceremonial dancers. Its upward-sweeping form and golden color distinguish it from other headwear. If lost or simplified beyond recognition, the figure would no longer be identifiable as a traditional Balinese dancer. Thus, preserving its shape and position is critical for cultural and visual identification.
    Question: Is the dancer wearing a tall, flame-shaped golden headdress with upward-curving elements?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The face paint—white complexion with darkened eyes and bright red lips—is a defining feature of Balinese dance performers. It is not merely cosmetic but symbolic. Altering or removing it would result in a loss of cultural authenticity and misrepresentation of the subject’s role. This is a core identity element.
    Question: Does the dancer have white-painted skin, darkened eyes, and red lips?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The dancer’s pose—arms extended in a graceful arc, one hand near the head, the other forward—is a classic Balinese dance gesture. This posture is essential to convey the narrative and emotion of the performance. Changing it would distort the intended expression and break the cultural context.
    Question: Is the dancer in a dynamic pose with one arm raised near the head and the other extended forward?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The temple’s multi-tiered pagoda structure with stepped roofs and upturned eaves is an iconic architectural feature of Balinese Hindu temples. Even if rendered in line art, its silhouette must remain intact to preserve cultural and geographical identity. Removing or simplifying its form would make it unrecognizable.
    Question: Is the temple composed of multiple stacked tiers with curved, upward-pointing roofs?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The two large mythical creatures are positioned symmetrically on either side of the path, facing inward. Their placement creates a balanced, ritualistic entrance. Moving or asymmetrizing them would disrupt the composition and symbolic framing of the scene. Their presence is essential for maintaining the sacred space motif.
    Question: Are there two large, identical-looking mythical creatures standing symmetrically on either side of the dancer?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The smaller seated statues beneath each creature are part of the temple’s guardian ensemble. They contribute to the layered spiritual hierarchy and are common in Balinese temple architecture. Removing them would simplify the scene excessively and reduce cultural depth.
    Question: Are there smaller seated statues located on the pedestals beneath each of the large mythical creatures?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The dancer’s jewelry—particularly the necklace and bracelets—is consistent with traditional Balinese attire. While minor compared to larger elements, it contributes to authenticity. Omitting it could lead to a perception of incomplete or inaccurate representation.
    Question: Does the dancer wear a visible gold necklace and bracelets?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
