      "thinking_process": "The circular front plate of the steam locomotive with visible rivets is a defining mechanical feature that identifies it as a classic steam engine. Its presence and structural detail are crucial for distinguishing it from other types of trains. If this element is lost or altered, the train would no longer be recognizable as a traditional steam locomotive, undermining the core identity of the scene. This is a key visual identifier, hence assigned 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the circular front plate with rivets on the steam locomotive present and accurately rendered?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The brick station building with its gabled roof and arched windows is a core environmental element that defines the setting. The specific architectural style and materials (red brick, wooden shingles) are essential for establishing the historical context. Altering these would change the scene’s authenticity and period feel. This is a major scene-defining feature, thus weighted at 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the station building made of red brick with a gabled roof and two arched windows visible and unaltered?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The position of the individuals on the platform relative to the train and station is critical for maintaining narrative logic. The instruction requires preserving their original positions, so any shift in location would violate the editing constraints. This spatial relationship supports the scene’s realism and must be preserved. This is an important functional element, hence 2 points.",
      "question": "Are all individuals standing in their original positions on the platform, facing the train or grouped as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The clothing of the individuals — particularly the long dresses, suits, and wide-brimmed hats — is a key indicator of the historical period and social context. The instruction mandates retaining their original outfits, so changing fabric patterns, colors, or styles would breach the requirement. These garments are essential for identifying the time and cultural setting, making them important retention targets. Weighted at 2 points.",
      "question": "Do all individuals wear the same clothing items as in the original image, including long dresses, suits, and hats?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The woman near the platform edge holding a rectangular leather suitcase is a distinct figure whose accessory contributes to the narrative of travel. The presence and position of the suitcase are specific visual details that must be preserved to maintain consistency. While not a core identity element, it is a notable secondary detail that affects scene coherence. Assigned 1 point.",
      "question": "Is the woman near the edge of the platform holding a rectangular leather suitcase in her right hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The railway tracks with wooden sleepers and metal rails are foundational infrastructure elements that define the setting. Their layout and material composition are essential for grounding the scene in reality. Any alteration would disrupt the physical logic of the environment. This is a key structural detail, thus weighted at 2 points.",
      "question": "Are the railway tracks composed of wooden sleepers and metal rails, extending diagonally from the foreground toward the train?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The smoke plume rising from the train’s chimney is a dynamic visual element that indicates the train is active and adds atmosphere. Its density and direction are tied to the locomotive’s operation and must be preserved to maintain realism. This is a significant environmental detail that enhances the scene’s authenticity. Weighted at 2 points.",
      "question": "Is a thick, dark smoke plume rising vertically from the train’s chimney into the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The warm golden lighting and hazy sky contribute to the mood and time of day, creating a cohesive visual tone. While not a structural element, the lighting condition is part of the original scene’s atmosphere and must be preserved to maintain visual consistency. This is a minor but noticeable detail affecting overall coherence. Weighted at 1 point.",
      "question": "Is the scene illuminated by warm golden light with a hazy sky, suggesting late afternoon?",
