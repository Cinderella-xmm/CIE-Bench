### Step 1: Description of Reference Image and Allowed Changes List

**Description of Reference Image:**  
The subject is a human hand with an open palm facing upwards. On the center of the palm rests a small, stark black silhouette of a bird, resembling a swallow, with its wings spread. The bird is depicted in a simple, flat design with minimal detailing. The hand has natural skin tones and visible creases, with fingers slightly spread apart. The background is plain and neutral, ensuring focus remains on the hand and the bird silhouette.

**Thinking Process:**  
The editing instructions specify transforming the bird silhouette into an Art Nouveau embellishment with gold linework and peacock feather iridescence. This indicates changes to the bird's appearance, including its color, texture, and design style. However, the instructions do not mention altering the hand or the background, implying these should remain consistent.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
1. The bird's color can change from black to include gold and iridescent hues.
2. The bird's design can evolve into an Art Nouveau style with swirling linework and detailed patterns.
3. The bird's texture can shift from a flat silhouette to a more intricate and luxurious appearance.

### Step 2: Determination of Elements That Should Remain Unchanged

**Thinking Process:**  
Core recognition elements include the human hand and its natural characteristics, as these establish the context for the bird design. Functional/logical association elements involve the bird's placement on the palm, maintaining the visual relationship between the hand and the bird. Remaining elements, such as the hand's skin tone and creases, contribute to visual coherence.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
1. The human hand with its natural skin tones and creases.
2. The positioning of the bird on the palm.
3. The neutral background.

### Step 3: Generation of Yes/No Questions

**Q1:**

**Q3:**  
Thinking process: The neutral background is important for keeping the focus on the hand and bird. Altering it could distract from the main subjects.
Question: Is the background still plain and neutral?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2

**Q4:**  
Thinking process: The bird's overall shape is a secondary detail that helps maintain visual consistency. While the design can change, the general outline should remain recognizable.
