      "thinking_process": "The Fender logo is a core brand identifier and appears on the headstock of the original guitar. The editing instruction mentions adding an emblem on the headstock but does not specify replacing the existing logo. Therefore, the presence of the Fender logo must be preserved, even if partially overlaid by the new emblem. Its absence would result in loss of brand identity and misrepresentation of the original subject.",
      "question": "Is the Fender logo visible on the headstock?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The six-string configuration is a defining functional feature of the guitar. The instruction states that the strings become \"muscle strands,\" but does not reduce their number. Each string must originate at the bridge and terminate at a tuning peg. Preserving the count ensures logical consistency and maintains the guitar’s identity as a six-string instrument.",
      "question": "Are there exactly six strings running from the bridge to the tuning pegs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The cutaway on the upper right side of the body is a distinctive design feature of this guitar model. It allows easier access to higher frets and is visually identifiable. The instruction does not mention altering this shape, so it must remain intact, even if stylized as part of the armor.",
      "question": "Is there a cutaway on the upper right side of the guitar body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The soundhole is centrally located on the body and is essential for the acoustic function of the guitar. Even when transformed into a superhero torso, the soundhole must remain in the same relative position to preserve the guitar’s anatomical logic. Its removal or relocation would disrupt the visual and functional integrity of the transformation.",
      "question": "Is the soundhole located in the center of the guitar body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The neck connects the body to the headstock and serves as the conduit for the strings. The instruction specifies that a cape flows from the neck, indicating its continued existence as a structural element. Altering its length or position would break the spatial logic of the character design.",
      "question": "Does the neck extend directly from the body to the headstock without significant deviation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The tuning pegs are critical for tuning the guitar. There are six total—three on each side of the headstock. The instruction does not specify changing their number or arrangement, so they must remain present and symmetrically placed. Their absence would make the guitar unrecognizable as a standard model.",
      "question": "Are there three tuning pegs on each side of the headstock?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The overall silhouette of the dreadnought cutaway body is a key visual identifier. While the texture may be changed to metallic, the outline must remain consistent to ensure the character is clearly derived from the original guitar. Any drastic reshaping would lose the reference to the original instrument.",
      "question": "Does the guitar body retain the classic dreadnought shape with a rounded lower bout and a cutaway on the upper right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
