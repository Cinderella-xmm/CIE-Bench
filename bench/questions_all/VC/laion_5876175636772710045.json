      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "The man’s arm wrapped around the woman’s back is a core structural element of the dance hold. This specific positioning defines the connection between partners in ballroom dance and is essential to maintaining the integrity of the performance. Altering it would change the nature of the dance and disrupt the visual logic of the pose. It is a functional element directly tied to the action being performed, making it a high-weight retention target.",
      "question": "Is the man's left arm still wrapped around the woman's back, supporting her in a ballroom dance hold?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The woman’s hand on the man’s shoulder is a key component of the dance frame, establishing physical contact and balance. This gesture is standard in formal ballroom dances and helps define the lead-follow dynamic. Removing or relocating it would distort the choreography and undermine the authenticity of the dance moment. As a functional and iconic detail of partner dancing, it must be preserved.",
      "question": "Does the woman's right hand remain on the man's left shoulder?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The woman’s arched back and lifted leg are central to the dramatic expression of the dance. This pose is visually distinctive and conveys motion and elegance. Changing the angle or eliminating the lift would lose the emotional and kinetic essence of the moment. It is a defining feature of the dancer’s posture and thus a core identity element in the scene.",
      "question": "Is the woman's back arched backward with her right leg lifted off the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The relative orientation of the dancers — man facing away, woman facing slightly toward the camera — establishes the spatial relationship critical to the composition. This perspective allows viewers to see both the leader’s control and the follower’s response. Reversing or rotating their positions would alter the narrative and visual focus of the image, affecting its coherence. This is a logical and compositional anchor.",
      "question": "Is the man positioned with his back to the viewer while the woman faces slightly toward the camera?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The direction of the woman’s hair flow — extending to the right — indicates the momentum of the spin or turn. This dynamic detail enhances the sense of movement and is consistent with the dance action. Preserving it ensures continuity of motion even after stylistic transformation. While not as structurally vital as the limbs, it contributes significantly to the realism of the pose.",
      "question": "Does the woman's long blonde hair flow outward to the right side of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The foot positioning — man’s left foot forward, woman’s right heel raised — reflects the precise timing and step of the dance. This detail supports the belief that the couple is mid-step, not static. Altering it could imply a different dance or freeze-frame, disrupting the intended motion. Though subtle, it is a crucial indicator of dance mechanics.",
      "question": "Is the man's left foot forward and the woman's right heel raised off the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The woman’s head tilt upward and gaze directed toward the upper left corner of the frame contribute to the emotional expression of the dance. This facial orientation adds drama and engagement. While less critical than body mechanics, it is a distinct detail that supports the overall mood and should be retained for consistency.",
      "question": "Is the woman's head tilted upward with her eyes looking toward the upper left of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
