      "thinking_process": "The open umbrella’s circular canopy with visible radial ribs and central hub is the defining structural feature of the object. Changing this would transform it into something other than an umbrella. The ribs are clearly visible in the original, forming a symmetrical pattern from the center outward. This is a core identity element — without it, the object cannot be recognized as an umbrella. Thus, it must be preserved, and its absence would render the edited image inconsistent with the original object type.",
      "question": "Does the open umbrella retain its circular canopy shape with visible radial ribs converging at a central hub?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The closed umbrella with its black casing, wrist strap, and metallic tip is a functional and structural component of the product. Its presence confirms the umbrella’s portability and usability. Removing or altering this would break the logical consistency of the product presentation. The wrist strap is a key accessory for handling, and the metallic tip is a standard feature of telescopic umbrellas. These are non-negotiable functional elements.",
      "question": "Is the closed umbrella present with a black casing, wrist strap, and metallic tip?",

      "thinking_process": "The starlit sky with visible stars and nebulae is explicitly instructed to be maintained. This is not just a background but a core atmospheric element. The texture of the sky — dark blue-black with scattered white and blue stars, and diffuse nebulae — is iconic in the original. Losing this would violate the instruction and destroy the celestial contrast intended in the surreal scene. The vastness and depth of the sky are essential to the surreal effect, so its visual characteristics must be preserved.",
      "question": "Is the starlit sky with visible stars and nebulae still present as the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The general spatial composition — foreground flowers, midground hill and tree, background sky — provides the foundational layout of the scene. Even if the tree becomes geometric or the field floats, the hierarchical layering must remain to preserve visual coherence. The hill slopes upward from bottom to top, with flowers in front, the tree in the middle distance, and the sky above. This structure supports the illusion of depth and perspective, which is critical for interpreting the scene correctly.",
      "question": "Is the scene composed with flowers in the foreground, a hill in the midground, and the sky in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The support ribs of the umbrella are structural lines that define the canopy’s geometry. They are visible as black lines radiating from the center. While the print may cover them, their physical presence is part of the umbrella’s design. Altering their number, spacing, or direction would distort the umbrella’s form. Their continuity across the canopy ensures the integrity of the object’s shape.",
      "question": "Are the black support ribs visible and extending from the central hub to the edge of the canopy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The presence of the yellow coneflowers and red poppies is essential to the floral composition, even if their colors are intensified. Their distinct shapes — daisy-like petals with central cones for yellow flowers, cup-shaped blooms for red poppies — are recognizable features. Although the instruction allows color enhancement, it does not permit removal. Thus, their **presence and basic morphology** must be retained to maintain the original scene’s botanical identity.",
      "question": "Are yellow coneflowers and red poppies present in the foreground of the scene?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
