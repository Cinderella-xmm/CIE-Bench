      "thinking_process": "The plaid pattern on the left tie is a key identifier because it is explicitly referenced in the instruction as the tie that \"checks a secret watch communicator.\" Its red, blue, and black interwoven design is unique and distinguishable from other patterns. If this pattern is lost or replaced, the tie cannot be correctly associated with the intended gadget function, undermining the narrative logic. It is a core functional and visual element, hence weighted at 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the plaid pattern (with red, blue, and black intersecting lines) on the left tie preserved?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The emblem on the right tie is a small, distinct badge-like feature, colored green and yellow, resembling a bear. It is directly referenced in the instruction as the site of a \"hidden camera\" embedded in the pattern. This makes it a core functional element — the presence and shape of the emblem are necessary for the gadget to be symbolically integrated. Losing it would break the narrative link between the tie and the spy device. Thus, it is a high-weight identification element.",
      "question": "Is the green and yellow bear-shaped emblem on the right tie preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The ties must remain identifiable as neckties worn around the collars, as they are the focus of the anthropomorphism. Their shape — narrow, tapered, and positioned diagonally across the chest — is essential for the comic's logic. Altering their shape into something unrecognizable (e.g., a rectangle or abstract form) would destroy the connection to real-world attire and the spy gadget concept. This is a functional requirement, making it a key preservation target.",
      "question": "Are both ties preserved in their original necktie shape (narrow, tapered, diagonal across the chest)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The relative positioning of the two figures (left and right) is critical for the comic panels to align with the description: Panel 1 features the plaid tie, Panel 2 the emblemed tie. Swapping their positions would misalign the narrative sequence. Although the figures may be anthropomorphized, their spatial arrangement must remain consistent with the original image to preserve logical continuity.",
      "question": "Is the figure with the plaid tie on the left side of the image, and the figure with the emblem on the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The background is described as a \"lush field,\" which is required to be preserved as the meeting backdrop. While artistic interpretation is allowed, the presence of green grass and open sky must remain to maintain the setting. Removing or replacing it with an urban or indoor environment would violate the instruction’s environmental requirement. However, specific details like distant trees or the canopy are not required, so only the general green field texture needs retention.",
      "question": "Is the background a grassy field with visible green vegetation extending into the distance?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
