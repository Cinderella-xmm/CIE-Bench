**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a square-shaped cake with a distinctive grid-like surface composed of uniformly arranged, rounded yellow meringue or sponge balls. Each ball has a small red dot (likely strawberry jam or gel) on top. The cake features a visible cross-section where one corner has been cut away, revealing multiple layers: a golden sponge base, a white cream layer, and a deep red filling (likely strawberry or raspberry jam). The cake is garnished with two whole strawberries placed at the top center, complete with green leaves. It rests on a silver-toned decorative plate with an embossed floral pattern, surrounded by scattered chopped nuts (possibly almonds) along its base. The background is a dark textured surface, possibly fabric or slate, providing contrast to highlight the cake’s vibrant colors. A logo in the bottom right corner reads “Cooking Saby” with a stylized chef hat and tiered cake icon.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instructions describe transforming the cake into a **lively cake creature** with **expressive eyes atop its strawberry hat**, implying a cartoonish anthropomorphism. This transformation involves:

- Changing the **form of the cake** from static food to a **character**.
- Adding **eyes** and **facial expressions** to the cake.
- Transforming the **strawberries** into a **"hat"** with expressive use.
- Introducing **new narrative panels** (comic strip format), including:
  - Panel 1: Cake creature surprised, shouting about missing corner.
  - Panel 2: Cake creature determined, with "bodyguards" (strawberries), shield (garnishes).
- Background changes to include **party atmosphere**, **silhouettes of utensils**, and **heroic pose**.

From this, we can extract the **allowed changes**:

- **Subject form**: Can be transformed into a character (anthropomorphic).
- **Facial features**: Eyes, expression — added or modified.
- **Strawberry placement/role**: Can be reimagined as a hat.
- **Background**: Entirely changeable to suit comic panels.
- **Perspective and composition**: Must shift to comic strip layout with two panels.
- **Narrative elements**: New dialogue, poses, and symbolic accessories (e.g., shield made of garnishes).

Thus, **any element not explicitly preserved in function or identity** may be altered.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
(Specific element 1 that allows for changes): The overall shape and structure of the cake (can become a character with limbs or facial features)  
(Specific element 2 that allows for changes): The position and function of the strawberries (can be reinterpreted as a hat)  
(Specific element 3 that allows for changes): The background environment (to be replaced with party silhouettes and comic-style panels)  
(Specific element 4 that allows for changes): The presence and arrangement of the cut corner (may be used narratively but can be repositioned or exaggerated)  
(Specific element 5 that allows for changes): The addition of expressive eyes and mouth on the cake surface  
(Specific element 6 that allows for changes): The role of garnishes (nuts, cream) — can be repurposed as shields or armor  
(Specific element 7 that allows for changes): The color tone and lighting — adjusted for comic style

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
We now determine what **must remain unchanged**, based on exclusion from the allowed changes list and core identification logic.

**Core recognition elements:**  
Even though the cake becomes a character, the **original visual identity** must be preserved enough to recognize it as *this specific cake*. Key features include:
- The **distinctive grid of yellow rounded domes** — this is the defining texture and pattern of the cake.
- The **red dots** atop each dome — these are consistent markers across the surface.
- The **cut corner** exposing layered interior — this structural detail is critical to identifying the cake’s internal composition.
- The **golden sponge base**, **white cream layer**, and **deep red jam layer** — these are signature components of the cake’s cross-section.
- The **two strawberries with green leaves** — they are central decorative elements and serve as key identifiers.

These cannot be removed or fundamentally altered because:
- Without the **grid of domes**, the cake loses its unique identity.
- Without the **layered interior**, the cake's structural integrity and design are lost.
- Without the **strawberries**, the cake lacks its signature topping.

**Functional/logical association elements:**  
- The **relationship between the cut corner and the internal layers** must be preserved — if the layers are changed or omitted, the cake’s structure is misrepresented.
- The **position of the strawberries relative to the top center** should remain recognizable, even if reinterpreted as a hat.

**Non-modified element deduction:**  
After removing allowed changes (e.g., adding eyes, changing background), the following must remain:
- The **yellow color of the domes**
- The **red dot on each dome**
- The **cross-sectional layers** (sponge, cream, jam)
- The **presence of the strawberries with green leaves**
- The **nut garnish around the base**
- The **overall square shape** of the cake (even if stylized)

Even though the cake is anthropomorphized, **its original physical traits must be visually traceable** in the final comic version.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
(Element 1 that should be maintained): The grid of yellow rounded domes covering the cake’s surface  
(Element 2 that should be maintained): The red dot on top of each dome  
(Element 3 that should be maintained): The cut corner revealing the layered interior (sponge, cream, jam)  
(Element 4 that should be maintained): The two strawberries with green leaves positioned at the top center  
(Element 5 that should be maintained): The golden sponge base layer visible in the cross-section  
(Element 6 that should be maintained): The deep red jam layer inside the cake  
(Element 7 that should be maintained): The white cream layer between the sponge and jam  
(Element 8 that should be maintained): The scattered chopped nuts around the base of the cake  
(Element 9 that should be maintained): The square shape of the cake  
(Element 10 that should be maintained): The silver-toned plate with embossed pattern beneath the cake  

(Note: While the plate may be obscured in a comic panel, its presence should still be implied or visible.)

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The grid of yellow rounded domes is the most iconic feature of the cake, distinguishing it from other desserts. Its uniformity, spacing, and yellow color are essential to recognition. If this pattern is lost or replaced, the cake would no longer be identifiable as the original. Therefore, this is a core identity element with high weight.
    Question: Is the grid of yellow rounded domes covering the surface of the cake present?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The red dots atop each dome are a consistent and repeated detail that adds visual rhythm and flavor indication. Their presence confirms the cake’s original decoration scheme. Removing them would alter the cake’s appearance significantly, even if the domes remain.
    Question: Are there small red dots on top of each yellow dome?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The cut corner revealing the internal layers is crucial to understanding the cake’s structure. The sequence of sponge, cream, and jam layers is a key identifier. If these layers are omitted or rearranged, the cake’s internal design is misrepresented.
    Question: Is the cross-section showing a golden sponge base, white cream layer, and deep red jam layer visible?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The two strawberries with green leaves are prominent toppings and serve as a signature decoration. Their placement at the top center is a fixed visual anchor. Even if reimagined as a hat, their presence and form must be retained.
    Question: Are two strawberries with green leaves positioned at the top center of the cake?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The scattered chopped nuts around the base are a secondary but distinctive garnish. They contribute to the cake’s presentation and help ground it visually. While less critical than the main layers, their absence would affect visual coherence.
    Question: Are chopped nuts visible around the base of the cake?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The square shape of the cake is fundamental to its geometry and distinguishes it from round or irregular cakes. Even in a cartoon version, the basic outline should reflect the original form.
    Question: Does the cake maintain a square shape?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The silver-toned plate with embossed pattern provides context and elevates the presentation. While the background may change, the plate remains a key environmental element tied to the original setting.
    Question: Is the cake placed on a silver-toned plate with an embossed floral pattern?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q8: 
    Thinking process: The deep red jam layer is a key flavor indicator and visual component. Its color and position between the cream and sponge are essential. Altering its hue or removing it would misrepresent the cake.
    Question: Is the deep red jam layer clearly visible between the white cream and golden sponge?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q9: 
    Thinking process: The white cream layer is a major structural and aesthetic component. Its thickness and position are consistent with the original design. Its removal would disrupt the cake’s internal balance.
    Question: Is the white cream layer visible between the sponge and jam layers?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q10: 
    Thinking process: The golden sponge base is the foundation of the cake. Its texture and color define the bottom layer. Losing this would make the cake unrecognizable as a sponge-based dessert.
    Question: Is the golden sponge base layer visible in the cross-section?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
