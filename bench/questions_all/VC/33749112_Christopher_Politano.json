      "thinking_process": "The three distinct mountain peaks—two broad and one sharp—are iconic features of the original landscape. Their relative positions and shapes define the skyline and are essential for identifying the location. If these peaks are completely reshaped or removed, the scene loses its geographic identity. Thus, preserving their presence and arrangement is critical for recognition. This is a core identity feature, so the weight is 3 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The central lake has a unique irregular shape with a curved western edge and a shallow extension toward the foreground. This shape is a defining feature of the basin. Even if transformed into a chest, the underlying geometry must remain consistent to preserve the original topography. Losing this shape would make the scene unrecognizable. This is a core identity feature, so the weight is 3 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The network of trails forms a logical path system across the slopes, connecting the lower areas to the lake and higher elevations. These trails provide spatial coherence and indicate human access. Although they may be transformed into luminescent veins, their routing and convergence points must remain consistent to maintain environmental logic. This is an important scene element affecting overall consistency, so the weight is 2 points.",

Their exact number and position are not critical, but their existence and general location (near the shoreline) are necessary to maintain realism and narrative continuity. Removing them would alter the scene’s interpretive value. This is a minor but meaningful detail, so the weight is 1 point.",

While the instruction allows replacing it with scales, the original green tone and coverage pattern must be preserved in form, even if stylized. This ensures the scene remains grounded in its original environment. This is a key visual characteristic, so the weight is 2 points.",
