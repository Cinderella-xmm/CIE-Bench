      "thinking_process": "The presence of a horn on the forehead is the defining feature of a unicorn. Even though the instruction changes the horn to a metallic spiral, the **presence of a horn** is non-negotiable for identity. If the horn is missing, the subject is no longer a unicorn. The original image shows two horns, but the instruction allows reduction to one. Therefore, the **existence of at least one horn on the forehead** is a core identity feature. Loss of this would make the subject unrecognizable as a unicorn. Hence, it is a 3-point question.",
      "question": "Is there at least one horn present on the forehead of the unicorn?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The equine body structure—specifically the four-legged horse-like form—is essential to the subject’s identity. Changing this would transform it into a different creature. The original image clearly shows a horse-shaped body with four legs, a neck, and a head. Even as a sculpture, the basic anatomy must be preserved to maintain recognition. Altering limb count or body shape would break identity. Thus, this is a core structural element and weighs 3 points.",
      "question": "Does the subject have four legs arranged in a horse-like stance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The three-quarter profile facing right is a key compositional element in the original image. It defines the spatial relationship between the viewer and the subject. Although the setting changes, the **orientation** of the figure is crucial for visual continuity. If the sculpture faces another direction, the composition is fundamentally altered. This is not a core identity feature, but an important scene-related element affecting overall consistency. Therefore, it is weighted at 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the unicorn positioned in a three-quarter view facing toward the right side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The eye is a critical facial feature for expression and species identification. In the original image, the eye is large, dark, and oval-shaped, located on the side of the head. Even as a sculpture, the eye’s **presence and position** must be preserved to maintain the equine likeness. Removing or relocating it would distort the face. While the material may change, the **visual location and shape** of the eye are key to recognition. This is an important detail affecting realism and coherence, hence 2 points.",
      "question": "Is there a visible dark, oval-shaped eye on the side of the unicorn's head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The head is slightly turned toward the viewer, giving a sense of engagement. This posture is distinct in the original image and contributes to the emotional tone. Even as a sculpture, preserving this **head turn** maintains the original dynamic. It is not a core identity feature, but a secondary detail that affects visual narrative and coherence. If lost, the sculpture appears less lifelike or engaged. Thus, it is a minor but meaningful detail, worth 1 point.",
      "question": "Is the unicorn's head slightly turned toward the viewer, showing part of the left side of the face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The overall body silhouette—particularly the broad shoulders, arched neck, and muscular build—is characteristic of the unicorn in the original image. This shape distinguishes it from other equines and contributes to its mythical grandeur. Even as a ceramic sculpture, the **general outline and mass distribution** must remain similar to preserve identity. A radically different shape would make it unrecognizable. This is a core structural element, thus 3 points.",
      "question": "Does the unicorn have a broad, muscular body with a high-set head and arched neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The position of the legs—specifically, the front legs slightly forward and the back legs supporting the weight—defines the stance. This is a functional anatomical detail that ensures the figure appears balanced and natural. Even as a sculpture, this **weight distribution** must be preserved to avoid appearing unstable or unnatural. It is a key detail for realism and coherence, so it receives 2 points.",
      "question": "Are the front legs positioned slightly forward, with the back legs supporting the body's weight?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
