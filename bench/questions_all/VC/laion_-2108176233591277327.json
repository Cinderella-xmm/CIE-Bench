      "thinking_process": "The red floral elements are a core identification feature of the original design, distinguishing it from other ceramic styles. Their presence is essential to maintain the visual identity of the piece. In the transformed image, even if they evolve into feather-like forms, the **red color** and **flower-like structure** must remain recognizable. Losing them would erase a key component of the original aesthetic, making the transformation unrecognizable as derived from the source. Therefore, this is a high-weight element.",

      "thinking_process": "The blue geometric border at the top of the cup and around the saucer is a signature element of Iznik pottery. It provides structural framing and visual rhythm. Even if transformed into a feathered or ornamental edge, the **blue color** and **repeating geometric pattern** must persist to retain stylistic continuity. Its absence would break the visual link to the original.",

      "thinking_process": "Green foliage is a defining secondary element in the floral design, providing contrast and organic flow. It appears consistently throughout the original, interwoven with red flowers and blue stems. In the edited version, it may become part of feather or wing structures, but the **green color** and **leaf-like shape** must remain identifiable. Removing it would disrupt the balance of the original palette and design logic.",

      "thinking_process": "Black outlining is critical to the clarity and definition of each motif in the original design. It separates colors and enhances detail, a hallmark of hand-painted Iznik ceramics. Even in a mystical transformation, the **black lines** must remain to preserve the sharpness and precision of the original style. Without them, the design would lose its distinctiveness.",

      "thinking_process": "The radial symmetry of the design—where patterns repeat in concentric circles around the center—is a key compositional feature. It reflects the craftsmanship and aesthetic of the original. In the phoenix egg transformation, the **symmetrical layout** must be maintained to preserve the sense of order and balance. Asymmetry would make the piece visually inconsistent with the source.",

      "thinking_process": "The color palette—blue, red, green, and black—is not just decorative but culturally significant. It defines the Iznik style. Any transformation must retain these **exact hues** to ensure authenticity. Changing them to gold, purple, or other tones would shift the cultural reference entirely.",

Even when transformed, the **phoenix egg** must sit within or upon the **nest-like saucer**, preserving the containment logic. This maintains narrative and visual coherence between the original and edited versions.",
