      "thinking_process": "The curved neck of the swan is a defining feature of its identity and posture. Even if transformed into a glass stopper, the **shape and curvature** must remain consistent to preserve recognition. The original swan has a long, elegant S-curve from head to body. This is a core identity element—without it, the object would not resemble a swan, undermining the thematic link. Therefore, the **curve of the neck** is a key visual anchor and must be preserved in form, even if material changes. This element is crucial for identification and carries a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the neck of the swan-shaped object still curved in an elegant S-shape, extending upward and backward from the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The **pink berry-like accents** on the pine sprigs are distinctive decorative elements in the original image. They are not standard greenery but have a specific **color and form** that contribute to the festive aesthetic. Since they are not mentioned for replacement in the instructions, their **presence and color** must be preserved. Changing them would disrupt the visual harmony and reduce fidelity to the original scene. These are important scene elements that help identify the winter holiday theme and thus carry a weight of 2 points.",
      "question": "Are the pink berry-like accents visible on the evergreen sprigs surrounding the base of the swan?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The **white snowflake ornament** is a unique, clearly defined object placed near the base of the swan. It is not just part of the snow but a separate decorative item. Its presence adds symbolic value and visual contrast. Since it is not referenced in the editing instruction, it must be retained. Removing it would diminish the festive detail and break consistency. It is a minor but identifiable detail, so it receives a weight of 1 point.",
      "question": "Is there a white snowflake-shaped ornament located near the base of the swan?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The **snow-covered ground** is a foundational element of the scene. It provides context and supports the swan sculpture. The texture and depth of the snow are visually significant. Since the instruction does not suggest removing or replacing it, and the swan is meant to rest on it, this surface must remain. Altering it would affect the realism and environmental logic. This is a key environmental element, hence a weight of 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the swan/bottle resting on a textured, snow-covered surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The **background crowd and colored bokeh lights** establish the festive, public winter setting. Their presence creates depth and atmosphere. The instruction does not specify changing the background, so it must be preserved. Removing or altering the lights would destroy the mood and context. This is a critical scene element for maintaining narrative coherence and emotional tone, thus receiving a weight of 2 points.",
      "question": "Are there blurred figures of people walking in the background under strings of colorful, glowing lights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The **orientation of the swan’s head** (facing left) is a fixed pose in the original image. Even if transformed into a bottle, the **directionality** of the head should remain consistent to preserve visual continuity. A reversal or rotation would misalign with the original composition. This is a minor but directional detail that affects symmetry and framing, so it receives a weight of 1 point.",
      "question": "Is the head of the swan-shaped object oriented toward the left side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
