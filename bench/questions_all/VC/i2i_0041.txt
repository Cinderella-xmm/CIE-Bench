Description of reference image: The image shows three sheep near a green metal gate in a snowy outdoor setting. One adult sheep appears to be feeding two younger ones. The background consists of snow-covered ground, bare trees, and wooden fences. The sheep are positioned close together, interacting with each other near the fence.

### Step 1 - Allowed Changes List:
- The sheep can be converted into chibi characters, altering their physical appearance including proportions and style.
- Winter accessories such as scarves, earmuffs, and gloves can be added to the sheep.
- The style of the image can be changed to flat, cartoonish with thick outlines.
- The background can be made transparent for sticker use.

### Step 2 - Preservation Targets List:

#### Thinking Process:
**Core Recognition Elements:** Despite the transformation into chibi characters, the essential identities of the sheep must remain identifiable. The interaction posture and the setting by the railing need to be maintained as specified in the instructions.

**Functional/Logical Association Elements:** The interaction between the sheep (like feeding behavior) and their proximity near the gate should be kept intact because this defines the context of the scene.

**Remaining Elements Based on Visual Coherence:** The cold winter environment aspects like the snow and the gate's general position must be kept to maintain the continuity of the scene.

**Preservation Targets List:**
- Interaction posture of the sheep by the railing.
- Position of the railing and gate in relation to the sheep.
- General snowy environment and the placement of the background fences.
