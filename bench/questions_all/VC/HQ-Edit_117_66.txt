Description of reference image: The subject is a square, ornate leather-bound book placed centrally on a wooden surface. The cover features an intricate embossed design with four dragons positioned in each quadrant, forming a symmetrical arrangement around a central circular compass-like structure. The dragons are rendered in high relief with detailed scales, claws, and flowing manes, carved in reddish-brown tones against a dark background. The central compass is divided into concentric rings filled with Chinese characters, symbols, and radial lines, resembling a traditional Chinese astrological or feng shui chart. At the center of the compass is a star-shaped pointer with a golden hub. The book’s edges show signs of wear, with visible stitching along the spine and corners reinforced with metal corner guards. To the left of the book lies a wooden tool resembling a mallet or pestle with a rectangular base and rounded top; to the right, a pointed metal stylus or awl rests vertically. The entire scene is set on a rustic wooden tabletop with horizontal planks, showing natural grain patterns and subtle texture variations.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions that explicitly state transformation goals: "Transform the ornate book into a wooden jigsaw puzzle with interlocking pieces." This indicates the **form** of the subject (book) is to be changed into a **puzzle**, meaning its physical structure will no longer be a bound book but fragmented into pieces. The instruction specifies **material change**: from leather-bound book to **wooden jigsaw**, so material type changes are allowed. It also states **color modifications**: “darker wood stains for dragon patterns, lighter shades for the compass,” which means **coloration** of elements can be altered. Texture is specified: “visible wood grain texture and smooth edges,” indicating new surface properties are introduced. Scene modification is implied: “arrange scattered pieces on a minimalist wooden tabletop,” suggesting the **background layout** and **object positioning** may change — including removal or repositioning of the mallet and stylus. However, the instruction does **not** mention changing the **design motifs** themselves (dragons, compass, inscriptions), nor does it suggest altering their **iconic forms** or **relative positions** within the composition. Therefore, while the object's form and context may change, the **core visual content** — i.e., the symbolic and structural elements of the original design — must remain recognizable.

Allowed Changes List:
- Form of the subject: transformed from a bound book into a wooden jigsaw puzzle
- Material: changed from leather and metal to wood
- Color scheme: dragons now in darker wood stain, compass in lighter shade
- Surface texture: addition of visible wood grain and smooth edges
- Object configuration: book broken into interlocking puzzle pieces
- Background setting: rearranged into a minimalist wooden tabletop with scattered pieces
- Position and presence of surrounding tools (mallet and stylus): not required to be preserved

Thinking process:
Core recognition elements: The dragons and the central compass are the **primary identifiers** of the original artwork. Their **iconic shapes**, **symmetrical placement**, and **symbolic function** (astrological/feng shui chart) define the cultural and visual identity of the piece. Even if transformed into a puzzle, these elements must retain their **distinctive forms** and **spatial relationships** to maintain recognition. For example, the **four-dragon quadrants** and **central circular chart** are essential to the design’s identity. If they were replaced or distorted beyond recognition, the image would lose its original meaning and aesthetic value.

Functional/logical association elements: The **compass-like structure** serves as a functional element — representing a traditional Chinese divination or directional system. Its radial divisions, text-filled rings, and central pointer imply a logical structure meant for interpretation. Any change to this layout would compromise its symbolic function. Additionally, the **dragon motifs** are culturally significant and serve as protective or celestial symbols in Chinese tradition — their **posture, directionality, and interaction with the compass** are logically tied to the theme. These relationships must be preserved even when reconfigured.

Non modified element deduction: After excluding allowed changes (form, material, color, texture, scene), what remains are the **specific visual details** inherent to the original design: the **number of dragons (four)**, their **positions (one per quadrant)**, the **circular nature of the compass**, the **presence of inscribed characters**, the **star-shaped pointer**, and the **overall symmetry**. These are not mentioned as changeable and are critical to maintaining visual coherence and cultural authenticity. Even though the medium changes, the **underlying design blueprint** must stay intact.

Preservation Targets List:
- The presence of four dragons, one in each quadrant
- The central circular compass with concentric rings and inscribed characters
- The star-shaped pointer at the center of the compass
- The symmetrical arrangement of dragons around the compass
- The relative orientation and posture of each dragon (e.g., facing inward toward the compass)
- The presence of Chinese characters within the compass rings
- The division of the cover into four quadrants by cross-shaped lines

    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The four dragons, each occupying one quadrant of the cover, are the most prominent and iconic elements of the design. Their presence, number, and spatial distribution are key to identifying the artwork as a traditional Chinese cosmological motif. Changing their number or removing any one would fundamentally alter the identity of the piece. Thus, preserving all four dragons in their respective quadrants is essential.

    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The central circular compass with multiple concentric rings and inscribed text is the functional core of the design. It represents a traditional Chinese astrological or feng shui instrument. Its existence and structure are crucial to the object’s identity. Removing or distorting this feature would destroy the symbolic and informational intent of the original.

    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The star-shaped pointer at the center of the compass is a distinctive functional detail that anchors the design. It resembles a compass needle or celestial indicator, reinforcing the navigational/astrological theme. Its presence is necessary for maintaining the intended symbolism and visual balance.

{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The presence of Chinese characters within the concentric rings of the compass is a key detail that conveys cultural and functional information. These inscriptions are likely related to zodiac signs, directions, or elemental cycles. Their retention ensures the authenticity and interpretive depth of the design.
