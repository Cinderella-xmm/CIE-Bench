Description of reference image: The image shows five individuals skiing in a snowy forest setting. They are dressed in winter clothing, including jackets in various colors (blue, red, yellow), ski pants, gloves, and hats. Each person holds ski poles and is positioned on skis along a snow-covered path. The background consists of snow-laden trees and a wooden fence running parallel to the path. The individuals appear to be engaged in a synchronized skiing activity.

### Step 1 - Allowed Changes List:

- **Subject Form**: Convert the individuals into chibi-style 3D cartoon characters.
- **Clothing Design**: Dress the characters in vibrant and festive winter attire inspired by traditional Chinese designs, incorporating red, gold, and blue hues, with embroidered motifs of dragons or phoenixes.
- **Scene Backdrop**: Replace the snowy forest with a celebratory scenery featuring “囍” paper-cut decorations adorning the snow-covered landscape.

### Step 2 - Preservation Targets List:

#### Thinking Process:
- **Core Recognition Elements**: The core identity of the image lies in the activity (skiing) and the group formation. These elements define the context and purpose of the scene.
- **Functional/Logical Association Elements**: The skis and poles are essential for the skiing activity and must be retained to maintain the logical coherence of the scene.
- **Remaining Elements**: The general positioning of the individuals relative to each other and the path should be retained to preserve the visual flow and narrative of the image.

**Preservation Targets List:**
- The activity of skiing.
- The group formation and relative positions of the individuals.
- The presence of skis and poles.
- The snowy path as the base surface for the activity.
