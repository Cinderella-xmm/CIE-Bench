      "thinking_process": "The helmet with curved horns and central white feather is the most iconic identifier of the character in *Skyrim*. It is a unique combination of shape and ornamentation that distinguishes this warrior from others. Losing the horns or the feather would make the character unrecognizable. This is a core identity feature, so it must be preserved even in chibi form. The question directly checks for the presence of the horn shape and feather, which are visually distinct and non-negotiable for identification.",

      "thinking_process": "The round shield with a central boss and visible rivets is a key accessory that defines the character’s combat role. Its shape and structural details are consistent across the game’s art and are essential for recognition. Even in a stylized chibi version, the shield must retain its circular form and central boss to maintain continuity. This is a high-weight element because it is both functional and iconic.",

      "thinking_process": "The sword sheathed at the back is a functional and symbolic element. Its presence confirms the character’s status as a warrior. The hilt is visible and distinct, and its location is fixed. Removing or relocating it would break the logical consistency of the character’s gear setup. This is a critical functional element that must be preserved.",

      "thinking_process": "The swirling Norse pattern on the shoulder pauldron is a distinctive decorative element that reflects the cultural design of the Nord race. It is not just ornamental but serves as a visual marker of origin. Even in a simplified chibi style, this pattern should be recognizable. Its preservation ensures cultural and stylistic fidelity.",

      "thinking_process": "The fur trim on the tunic is a key detail that adds texture and realism to the character’s appearance. It is a recurring feature in *Skyrim*’s Nord armor and helps distinguish it from other races. While the texture may be simplified in chibi form, the presence of fur along the edges of the tunic must be maintained to preserve visual coherence.",

      "thinking_process": "The shape and placement of the helmet’s horns are critical for accurate representation. The horns curve outward and upward in a specific way, and their positioning relative to the helmet is fixed. Any deviation would alter the character’s silhouette and reduce recognizability. This is a minor but precise detail that supports the core identity.",
