Description of reference image: This image features an English Bulldog balancing on a skateboard.

The dog is outdoors on a grassy area, with buildings and a paved pathway visible in the background. The skateboard is blue with colorful designs and has four white wheels.

### Step 1 - Allowed Changes List

Thinking process: The given instructions are about transforming a vase and bouquet into a 3D printed model, adding a display plaque, and setting the background as a tech expo booth. Since the reference image contains neither a vase, bouquet, nor any relevant objects, the allowed changes do not apply here. However, we will consider potential changes if this was applicable. 

Allowed Changes List:
Specific element 1 that allows for changes: Transforming the vase and bouquet into a 3D printed display model.
Specific element 2 that allows for changes: Adding a display plaque at the base.
Specific element 3 that allows for changes: Setting the background as a tech expo booth.

### Step 2 - Preservation Targets List

Thinking process: Core recognition elements include the bulldog’s distinct physical traits, skateboard placement, and outdoor environment. Functional/logical elements involve the dog balancing on the skateboard. Non-modified elements would be finer details like the dog harness and the skateboard design.

Preservation Targets List:
(Element 1 that should be maintained: English Bulldog’s physical traits, including tan coat and white facial markings.)
(Element 2 that should be maintained: The balancing act of the dog on the skateboard.)
(Element 3 that should be maintained: The outdoor grassy setting with buildings in the background.)
(Element 4 that should be maintained: The blue skateboard with its design.)
(Element 5 that should be maintained: The black harness on the dog.)
