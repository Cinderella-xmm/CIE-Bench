Description of reference image: The subject is a woman standing in a dynamic pose, facing slightly to the left with her head turned toward the camera. She wears a pink sleeveless top with long sleeves made of leopard-print fabric; the right sleeve features a prominent printed cheetah face near the shoulder. Her left arm is raised in a boxing stance, wearing a gold-colored boxing glove with visible yellow laces and a red "Everlast" logo on the wrist strap. Her right hand also holds a similar gold boxing glove, positioned lower and relaxed. She has long, wavy blonde hair partially tied back with a red and black leopard-print headscarf that drapes down her back. Her makeup includes bold teal eyeshadow, defined eyebrows, and bright red lipstick. She wears high-waisted black jeans. The background consists of large green palm fronds arranged diagonally across a light beige backdrop, framed by a white geometric border composed of overlapping rectangles. The overall composition is stylized and fashion-forward, with strong contrasts between the vibrant clothing, metallic gloves, and natural foliage.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions word by word. The instruction specifies transforming the image into an Ancient Egyptian painted relief, which implies a complete stylistic overhaul. However, it explicitly states how certain elements should be reimagined rather than removed: the leopard print top becomes a royal linen garment with leopard motifs, the golden gloves become symbolic gilded offerings, and the palm leaves are stylized as sacred flora within a hieroglyph-bordered scene on a sandstone wall. This indicates that while form and context change, the core identity of the subject (woman), the leopard motif, the gold gloves, and the palm leaf background are not to be eliminated but transformed. Therefore, changes are allowed in:
- The style and medium (from photo to relief)
- The posture (to Egyptian formal pose: profile face, frontal eyes)
- The attire’s material and design (leopard print → royal linen with motifs)
- The gloves’ function (boxing → symbolic offerings)
- The background’s nature (palm leaves → sacred flora, framed by hieroglyphs)

However, the instruction does **not** allow for removal or replacement of the core visual content—only transformation. Thus, the following elements must be preserved in some form:
- The presence of the leopard pattern (as a motif)
- The gold color of the gloves
- The woman’s identity as the central figure
- The palm leaf background (reinterpreted as sacred flora)
- The framing structure (white geometric border may be retained or adapted)

Allowed Changes List:
- Subject's posture (can be changed to Egyptian formal pose)
- Clothing texture and type (leopard print top → royal linen with leopard motifs)
- Gloves' function and representation (boxing gloves → symbolic gilded offerings)
- Background elements (palm leaves → stylized sacred flora)
- Overall artistic style (photo → painted relief on sandstone)
- Color palette (may shift to earth tones typical of Egyptian art)
- Facial orientation (face in profile, eyes frontal)
- Scene setting (modern studio → hieroglyph-bordered sandstone wall)

Step 2 - Determine the elements that should remain unchanged

Thinking process:
Core recognition elements: The original image contains several unique identifiers that define its identity. The most critical are:
- The leopard print pattern on the sleeves, especially the **cheetah face graphic** on the right sleeve — this is a distinctive, non-replaceable design element that serves as a key identifier of the original outfit.
- The **gold boxing gloves**, particularly their **metallic sheen and yellow laces** — these are iconic accessories that define the subject’s action and style.
- The **red and black leopard-print headscarf** — this matches the sleeve pattern and creates a cohesive visual theme.
- The **bold makeup**: teal eyeshadow and red lips — these are signature aesthetic choices that contribute to the subject’s recognizable appearance.
- The **palm frond background** — though to be stylized, it is explicitly mentioned in the instruction as being transformed into sacred flora, meaning it must be retained in concept.

Functional/logical association elements:
- The **raised left arm with glove** — this conveys a boxing gesture, which is central to the subject’s action. Even if transformed into a symbolic offering, the **arm position and glove presence** must be preserved in form or function.
- The **positioning of the gloves relative to the body** — one raised, one lowered — maintains the dynamic balance of the pose, which should be preserved in the new composition.

Non-modified element deduction:
After excluding allowed changes (posture, style, materials), the remaining unmentioned details must be retained:
- The **presence of the cheetah face on the sleeve**
- The **color and pattern of the headscarf**
- The **texture and placement of the palm leaves**
- The **white geometric frame** — although not explicitly mentioned, it is a structural element of the composition and likely intended to be preserved or adapted into the relief border.

Preservation Targets List:
- The cheetah face graphic on the right sleeve
- The gold color and lacing of the boxing gloves
- The leopard print pattern on the sleeves and headscarf
- The red and black headscarf with leopard pattern
- The palm frond background
- The white geometric border framing the image
- The subject’s facial features (especially teal eyeshadow and red lips)
- The raised left arm with glove

Q1:  
Thinking process: The cheetah face graphic on the right sleeve is a highly specific and iconic design element that distinguishes this outfit from generic leopard prints. It is a core identity feature of the original image, and its absence would make the transformation lose its connection to the source. Since the instruction allows reimagining the attire but not removing the leopard motif, this graphic must be preserved in some form (e.g., as a decorative motif on the royal linen). Its presence is essential for visual continuity and recognition.  
Question: Is the cheetah face graphic present on the right sleeve of the subject's top?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The gold boxing gloves are central to the subject’s identity and action in the original image. Their metallic gold color and yellow laces are distinctive visual markers. Although they are to be transformed into symbolic gilded offerings, the instruction implies their retention in symbolic form. Therefore, the **gold color** and **gloved hands** must be preserved, even if stylized. Losing them would remove a key functional and aesthetic element.  
Question: Are both boxing gloves rendered in gold color with visible yellow laces?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The leopard print pattern on the sleeves and headscarf is a recurring motif that defines the subject’s style. While the instruction allows changing the material to royal linen, it specifies that the leopard motifs should remain. Therefore, the **pattern itself** — the distribution of black and brown spots on a light background — must be preserved in the new design. This is a core visual identity element.  
Question: Is the leopard print pattern present on the sleeves and headscarf of the subject?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The red and black leopard-print headscarf is a distinct accessory that complements the outfit. Its color scheme and pattern match the sleeves, creating a cohesive look. The instruction does not mention replacing it, only reimagining it as part of the royal attire. Therefore, the **color combination** and **leopard pattern** must be retained.  
Question: Is the headscarf worn by the subject red and black with a leopard print pattern?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The palm frond background is explicitly mentioned in the instruction as being transformed into sacred flora. This means the **presence of palm-like foliage** must be preserved, even if stylized. The original green color and leaf shape are key to identifying the background, so their conceptual presence must remain.  
Question: Are green palm fronds visible in the background behind the subject?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The white geometric border frames the entire image and contributes to its structured, fashion-editorial feel. Though not explicitly mentioned in the instruction, it is a defining compositional element. The instruction mentions a "hieroglyph bordered scene," suggesting the border may be adapted, but its **presence and rectangular structure** should be preserved.  
Question: Is there a white geometric border composed of overlapping rectangles framing the image?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The subject’s makeup — specifically the teal eyeshadow and red lips — is a key part of her visual identity. These colors are bold and distinctive, contributing to the overall aesthetic. The instruction does not mention altering them, and since the transformation is into a painted relief, these colors may be preserved in a stylized form. Their retention ensures the subject remains recognizable.  
Question: Does the subject have teal eyeshadow and bright red lipstick?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q8:  
Thinking process: The raised left arm with the gold glove is a functional gesture that defines the subject’s action. Even if transformed into a symbolic offering, the **arm position** and **glove presence** must be preserved. This is a logical element tied to the subject’s pose and intent.  
Question: Is the subject’s left arm raised with a gold boxing glove?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2
