Description of reference image: The subject is a man surfing on a blue surfboard in the ocean. His back is turned towards the viewer, and he is shirtless with black swim shorts. He is positioned on top of a wave, balancing skillfully. The background consists of an expansive, clear blue sky and calm ocean water, with smaller waves breaking near the foreground.

### Step 1 - Allowed Changes List:

**Thinking process:** Analyzing the instructions, we see that the surfboard is to be replaced by a giant manta ray, and a dreamy atmosphere is to be added. This implies changes in the following specific elements:

- **Surfboard shape and form**: Replace with a manta ray.
- **Atmospheric elements**: Adjustments to lighting, color tones, and possibly some softening or blur effects to create a dreamy feel.

Allowed Changes List:
- Surfboard replaced with a giant manta ray
- Adjustment of lighting and color tones to create a dreamy atmosphere

### Step 2 - Preservation Targets List:

**Thinking process:** Elements not specified for change include the surfer's posture, position relative to the wave, and the overall ocean and sky setting. Core recognition elements and functional associations are:

- **Surfer's position and pose**: The stance and balance on the manta ray must mimic the original surfboard posture.
- **Wave structure and ocean backdrop**: The wave's form and the ocean's general look must remain consistent to keep the scene logical.
- **Sky and horizon**: Retaining the horizon line and clear sky preserves the overall scene composition.

Preservation Targets List:
- Surfer's posture and position relative to the wave
- Wave formation and ocean background
- Sky and horizon line
