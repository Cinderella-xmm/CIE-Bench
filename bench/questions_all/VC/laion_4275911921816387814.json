      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "The **curved shape** of the blade is the most iconic feature distinguishing this dagger from straight-bladed weapons. It is a core identity element—without the curve, the object would not be recognizable as a jambiya-style dagger. The instruction allows material change but not shape modification, so preserving the curve is essential. This is a 3-point element because losing it would fundamentally alter the object’s identity.",
      "question": "Is the blade visibly curved in the same manner as in the original image, extending from the guard to a pointed tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The **segmented appearance** of the hilt, with its distinct sections resembling bone or ivory, is a unique visual trait. This pattern is central to the dagger’s aesthetic and historical authenticity. Even if made of fabric, the segmentation must remain visible to preserve recognition. Changing it to a smooth surface would lose this key detail. This is a 3-point element due to its role in identification.",
      "question": "Does the hilt retain the segmented, block-like pattern along its length, similar to the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The **ornate guard** with its **floral and geometric engravings** is a hallmark of traditional craftsmanship. Its presence and detailed design are crucial for authenticity. Although the material changes, the **design layout** must be preserved. Removing or simplifying it would reduce the cultural and artistic value. This is a 2-point element as it is important for visual fidelity and style.",
      "question": "Is the guard decorated with intricate floral and geometric patterns, matching the original design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The **black filigree pattern** on the blade is not just decorative—it is a defining visual motif. The pattern's density and distribution are unique and must be preserved in the plush version, even if rendered in embroidery. Altering the pattern would make the object visually inconsistent with the original. This is a 3-point element because it is a key identifier of the blade’s design.",
      "question": "Is the blade covered with a dense black filigree pattern, matching the original in layout and coverage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The **relative proportions** between the hilt, guard, and blade determine the dagger’s balance and recognizability. The blade is significantly longer than the hilt, and the guard connects them at a specific point. Altering these proportions would distort the object’s form. This is a 2-point element because it affects structural accuracy and visual coherence.",
      "question": "Are the proportions between the hilt, guard, and blade preserved, with the blade being longer than the hilt?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The **pointed tip** of the blade is a functional and visual endpoint. Even in a plush version, it must remain pointed to reflect the original’s form. A blunt or rounded tip would deviate from the source. This is a 1-point element as it is a minor but necessary detail for fidelity.",
      "question": "Does the blade end in a pointed tip, consistent with the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The **overall silhouette** and **diagonal orientation** from top-left to bottom-right are key to the composition. Changing the angle or cropping the object would affect visual consistency. This is a 1-point element as it pertains to framing and presentation rather than core identity.",
      "question": "Is the dagger positioned diagonally across the frame, from upper left to lower right, as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
