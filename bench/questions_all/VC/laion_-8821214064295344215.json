      "thinking_process": "The yellow bow on the left bear's head is a defining accessory that distinguishes it from the right bear. It is located on the top-left side of the head and is a key visual identifier. If removed or relocated, the character identity is compromised. This is a core recognition feature due to its unique placement and color contrast.",

      "thinking_process": "The turquoise ribbon tied around the neck of the right bear is a signature element that matches its sweater and contrasts with the left bear. Its presence and position are essential for identifying the bear’s thematic color and accessory pairing. Removing it would break the visual logic of the design.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The paw coloration is a critical differentiator: the left bear has yellow paws, the right has turquoise. This color consistency across limbs reinforces the thematic design and must be preserved even in mosaic form to maintain visual identity.",
      "question": "Do the paws of the left teddy bear have yellow coloring?",

      "thinking_process": "The black button eyes are a standard feature of teddy bear design and are essential for facial recognition. Their position and color are fixed in the original image and must be preserved in any transformation to maintain the bear-like appearance.",

      "thinking_process": "The white snout and brown nose are characteristic facial features that define the bear’s expression and species identity. Altering these would make the figure unrecognizable as a bear. They are core to the animal’s morphology.",
      "question": "Do both teddy bears have white snouts with brown noses?",
