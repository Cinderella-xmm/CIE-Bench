Description of reference image: The subject is a pigeon perched on an ornate stone sphere atop a Corinthian column capital, positioned within a classical architectural frame. The pigeon faces left, with its head slightly turned toward the viewer, showcasing a dark blue iridescent neck, gray and black wings with intricate feather patterns, and a white patch near the beak. Its feet are orange, and it stands firmly on the spherical ornament. The background features a bright blue sky with scattered cumulus clouds, framed by a carved archway with detailed floral and scroll motifs. To the left, a tall fluted column rises into the sky, and in the distance, a cityscape blends Gothic-style spires with modern skyscrapers, creating a surreal juxtaposition of architectural styles. The lighting is natural daylight, casting soft shadows that emphasize depth and texture.

Thinking process:  
First, analyze the editing instructions word by word to determine what can be changed:  
- "Transform the pigeon into a plush toy" → The **form** of the pigeon changes from realistic bird to stylized plush; thus, its material (feathers → fabric), texture (realistic → soft), and shape (natural proportions → exaggerated) are allowed to change.  
- "Use vibrant blue for the chest and gray for the wings" → Color palette is specified but may override original hues; however, since this is part of the transformation, **color** is permitted to change.  
- "Incorporating subtle feather patterns on the surface" → This implies **texture details** can be reimagined as printed or stitched patterns on fabric, so **surface pattern** is modifiable.  
- "Render the architectural structures as cookie edifices with embossed details" → The **material and appearance** of buildings are to be altered to resemble cookies; therefore, **building materials**, **textures**, and **structural realism** are allowed to change.  
- "Arrange the plush pigeon on a simple wooden shelf" → The **supporting platform** changes from a stone sphere/column to a wooden shelf; hence, **platform type**, **material**, and **position** are changeable.  
- "Enhancing the playful contrast between soft textures and intricate cookie architecture" → This describes the **overall aesthetic tone**, not specific elements to retain; thus, it does not constrain retention of original visual content.

Allowed Changes List:  
- Form and material of the pigeon (from real bird to plush toy)  
- Color of the pigeon’s chest and wings (vibrant blue and gray)  
- Surface texture of the pigeon (feather patterns → stitched/printed designs)  
- Material and appearance of architectural structures (stone → cookie-like)  
- Supporting structure (stone sphere → wooden shelf)  
- Background environment (cityscape → cookie cityscape)  

Step 2 – Determine the elements that should remain unchanged  
Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements:  
- The **pigeon’s identity** is central, but since the instruction explicitly transforms it into a plush toy, its **biological form** is no longer required. However, the **iconic posture** (perched sideways, head turned) must still reflect the original pose to maintain visual continuity.  
- The **architectural framing** includes a classical arch with decorative carvings — these are **not mentioned for change**, and their **presence and position** are essential to preserve the scene's composition. Even if buildings become cookies, the **frame itself** remains a structural anchor.  
- The **Corinthian column capital** beneath the sphere is a key architectural detail; while the **column base** may be replaced, the **capital’s shape and placement** relative to the frame must be retained to maintain spatial logic.  
- The **stone sphere** is the perch point; although it will be replaced by a wooden shelf, the **function** (supporting the pigeon) and **position** (top of column capital) must remain consistent to preserve logical positioning.  

Functional/logical association elements:  
- The **pigeon’s location** atop the sphere is critical for spatial coherence. Even if the sphere becomes a shelf, the **relative height and orientation** must match to preserve the scene’s balance.  
- The **architectural frame** serves as a portal framing the view; changing its structure would disrupt the **visual narrative** of looking through a window into a fantastical world. Therefore, its **shape, position, and ornamental details** must remain intact.  

Non-modified element deduction:  
- While the **buildings** are to be rendered as cookies, the **sky and cloud formations** are not mentioned for change. Thus, **cloud shapes**, **sky color**, and **lighting direction** should be preserved to maintain atmospheric consistency.  
- The **perspective** of the scene — with the column on the left and distant skyline — must remain to preserve depth and composition.  
- The **ornamentation style** of the frame (floral scrolls, acanthus leaves) is not specified for alteration, so it must be retained.  

Preservation Targets List:  
- The presence and shape of the classical archway framing the scene  
- The ornamental carvings on the arch and column capital  
- The position and function of the column capital supporting the perch  
- The perspective and layout of the background skyline (including the tall column and distant spires)  
- The sky with its blue hue and scattered cumulus clouds  
- The overall composition of the pigeon perched within the frame

    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The classical archway is the dominant structural element framing the entire scene. Its presence defines the composition and creates a sense of viewing through a portal. If removed or significantly altered, the image loses its defining architectural context. This is a core identity feature of the scene, making it a 3-point question.
    Question: Is the classical archway with ornate carvings present and maintaining its original shape and position in the frame?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The Corinthian column capital, with its characteristic acanthus leaf design, is a distinctive architectural feature. Its retention ensures continuity in the style and structural logic of the scene. Even if the column base changes, the capital must remain to preserve the classical motif. This is a key architectural identifier, warranting a 3-point weight.
    Question: Is the Corinthian column capital with acanthus leaf detailing visible and correctly positioned beneath the spherical perch?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The stone sphere serving as the perch is a unique sculptural element. Although the instruction replaces it with a shelf, the function and location of the perch must remain consistent. The original sphere’s position atop the capital is crucial for spatial logic. Thus, even if transformed, its **placement** must be preserved. This is a functional element tied to the subject’s position, so it is a 2-point question.
    Question: Is the perch located directly on top of the Corinthian column capital, maintaining its original vertical alignment?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The background skyline, including the tall column on the left and the mix of Gothic and modern buildings, establishes the setting. Although the buildings may be rendered as cookies, their **silhouettes and spatial arrangement** must remain to preserve the scene’s depth and composition. This is a key environmental element, affecting overall coherence, hence a 2-point weight.
    Question: Are the tall fluted column on the left and the distant spired buildings visible in their original positions and silhouettes?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The sky with its bright blue color and scattered cumulus clouds provides the backdrop and lighting context. Since no instruction mentions altering the sky, it must remain unchanged to preserve atmosphere and lighting consistency. This is a minor but important environmental detail, contributing to visual harmony, so it is a 1-point question.
    Question: Is the sky depicted as bright blue with scattered white cumulus clouds, matching the original image?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The ornamental carvings on the arch and column frame are intricate and stylistically significant. They define the classical aesthetic and are not mentioned for modification. Their retention ensures visual fidelity to the original design. Though secondary, they are essential for authenticity, so assigned 2 points.
    Question: Are the floral and scroll carvings on the arch and column frame present and accurately rendered?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The pigeon’s side-facing posture with head turned slightly toward the viewer is a key compositional choice. Even as a plush toy, the **orientation and gaze direction** must remain to preserve the subject’s engagement with the viewer. This is a core behavioral feature of the original image, making it a 2-point question.
    Question: Is the pigeon oriented sideways with its head turned slightly toward the viewer, maintaining its original posture?
    Choices: Yes, No
