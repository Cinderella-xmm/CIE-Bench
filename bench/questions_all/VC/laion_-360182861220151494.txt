**Step 1 – Analyze the editing instructions and determine allowed changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a female anime character with long, flowing orange-red hair featuring yellow highlights, styled in a dynamic, sweeping manner. She has striking red eyes with golden irises, and her facial expression is confident with a slight smirk. She wears a dark green military-style uniform with gold trim, including a high collar, shoulder epaulets, and a double-breasted jacket with visible buttons. The sleeves have gold insignias resembling an anchor-like symbol. Her outfit includes thigh-high black boots with yellow cuffs, and she holds a katana with a detailed hilt and a yellow-wrapped tsuka (handle), its blade glowing with energy. The background is a vibrant gradient of green, yellow, and magenta, with abstract light streaks and starbursts, suggesting motion and power. A faint silhouette of another character appears in the upper right corner, partially obscured by purple energy effects. The overall composition emphasizes action, energy, and dramatic lighting.

Thinking process:  
The editing instruction explicitly transforms the original single-panel image into a **three-panel manga page** titled “Flame’s Journey to Glory.” Each panel specifies different emotional states, actions, and speech bubbles, indicating that the **layout, framing, and narrative sequence** are to be altered. However, it does not specify changing the **identity or core visual traits** of the character or the **symbolic elements** tied to her design. Instead, it focuses on recontextualizing the scene across panels while preserving the character’s essence.

Key modifications allowed:
- **Panel structure**: The image must be split into three distinct manga panels.
- **Emotional expressions**: The character's facial emotion changes per panel (determined → focused → triumphant).
- **Action poses**: The character’s posture evolves—close-up grip → leaping forward → standing victorious.
- **Speech bubbles**: Text boxes and dialogue must be added as specified.
- **Background dynamics**: Fiery trails, swirling energy, and color contrasts should be enhanced per panel.
- **Aspect ratio**: Each panel must be 3:4.

These indicate that the **subject’s identity**, **key costume features**, and **iconic weapon** are expected to remain consistent across panels, even as pose and expression change.

Allowed Changes List:  
- Panel layout and format (from full-image to three-panel manga)  
- Character’s facial expression and eye detail (intensity, focus, triumph)  
- Body posture and movement (gripping sword, leaping, standing)  
- Background effects (fiery trails, energy swirls, light bursts)  
- Speech bubbles and text content  
- Aspect ratio of each panel (adjusted to 3:4)  
- Dynamic motion lines and energy effects

**Step 2 – Determine elements that should remain unchanged**

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements must be preserved because they define the character’s identity and distinguish her from others. In this case, the character is likely **Shakugan no Shana**, identifiable by:
- Her **distinctive orange-red hair with yellow tips**
- Her **red eyes with golden pupils**
- Her **military-style green uniform with gold trim**
- The **anchor-like insignia** on her sleeve
- The **katana with yellow-wrapped handle and glowing blade**
- The **overall aesthetic** combining fantasy and military themes

Functional/logical association elements include:
- The **katana being held in hand** — essential for action logic; if replaced or removed, the "sword-wielding" narrative fails.
- The **uniform's structural details** — such as the double-breasted jacket and button alignment — maintain authenticity.
- The **hair’s flow and length** — critical for conveying motion and identity.

Non-modified element deduction:
Even though the pose changes, the **color palette**, **clothing style**, **weapon design**, and **character proportions** must remain consistent across panels. The **background’s vivid contrast** (green/yellow/magenta) is part of the original aesthetic and should be retained in tone, even if rearranged per panel.

Preservation Targets List:  
- Orange-red hair with yellow highlights and flowing strands  
- Red eyes with golden irises  
- Dark green military-style uniform with gold trim  
- Anchor-like insignia on left sleeve  
- Katana with yellow-wrapped tsuka and glowing blade  
- Thigh-high boots with yellow cuffs  
- Overall character proportions and facial structure  
- Vibrant, high-contrast background color scheme

**Step 3 – Generate yes/no questions based on key identifying visual elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The orange-red hair with yellow highlights is the most iconic visual trait of the character, directly tied to her identity in the source material. This specific color combination and flowing style are unique identifiers. If altered, the character would no longer be recognizable as the original. Therefore, this is a core identity feature worth 3 points.
    Question: Does the character retain her signature orange-red hair with yellow tips and flowing strands?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The red eyes with golden irises are distinctive and consistent across all depictions of the character. They are essential for facial recognition and emotional expression. Changing their color or shape would alter the character’s identity. Thus, this is a core recognition element worth 3 points.
    Question: Are the character's eyes red with golden irises?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The dark green military-style uniform with gold trim is a defining element of the character’s appearance. It includes specific features like the high collar, double-breasted front, and gold buttons. Altering the color or style would make the character unrecognizable within the series context. This is a core identity feature worth 3 points.
    Question: Is the character wearing a dark green military-style uniform with gold trim and visible buttons?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The anchor-like insignia on the sleeve is a unique symbolic detail associated with the character’s faction or rank. Its presence confirms authenticity and continuity. Removing or altering it would break visual consistency and diminish identification. This is a key accessory element worth 2 points.
    Question: Is there an anchor-like insignia visible on the character's left sleeve?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The katana with a yellow-wrapped tsuka and glowing blade is central to the character’s role and action scenes. It is a functional object tied to her abilities. Any change in its design (e.g., color, shape, glow) would disrupt narrative logic and visual coherence. This is a key accessory element worth 2 points.
    Question: Is the character holding a katana with a yellow-wrapped handle and a glowing blade?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The thigh-high boots with yellow cuffs are part of the character’s consistent outfit design. While less central than the uniform or weapon, they contribute to overall visual identity and proportion. Their absence or alteration would affect coherence. This is a minor but identifiable detail worth 1 point.
    Question: Do the character's boots extend to the thigh and feature yellow cuffs at the top?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}
{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The vibrant background with green, yellow, and magenta gradients and abstract light effects is a signature stylistic choice that defines the image’s energy and mood. While the layout may change, the color palette and luminous texture should be preserved to maintain visual consistency. This is a key environmental element worth 2 points.
    Question: Does the background retain the vibrant green, yellow, and magenta color scheme with abstract light streaks and starbursts?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
