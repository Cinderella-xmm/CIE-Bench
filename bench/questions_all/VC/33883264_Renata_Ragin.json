      "thinking_process": "The **Gothic arch shape** within each stone tower is a defining architectural feature of the Brooklyn Bridge. Its distinctive pointed form and symmetrical placement are key to identifying the bridge. Even when transformed into a golem, the arches must remain visually recognizable as part of the structure’s base form. Their loss would result in unrecognizable alteration of the bridge’s identity. Therefore, this element is a core identifier with a weight of 3 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The **American flag flying atop the left tower** is a specific detail that anchors the image to its real-world context. It is a small but significant symbolic element that confirms the location and time period. While it could theoretically be incorporated into the golem’s design (e.g., as a banner), its absence without replacement would represent a failure to preserve a key contextual marker. As such, it is an important detail with a weight of 2 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The **stone masonry texture and coloration** of the bridge towers are fundamental to the bridge’s historical and aesthetic identity. The light gray sandstone with visible weathering and block patterns distinguishes it from other bridges. Altering this texture would fundamentally change how the structure is perceived. Since the instruction does not specify replacing it with another material, the original texture should remain intact unless integrated into the golem’s skin. This is a core visual element with a weight of 3 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The **relative position of the Freedom Tower behind the bridge** is crucial for spatial logic and geographic accuracy. It establishes depth and scale in the scene. Even if transformed into a crown, its placement must align with the original perspective to maintain coherence. Displacement or misalignment would disrupt the viewer’s sense of place. This is a key scene element with a weight of 2 points.",

It reflects parts of the bridge and sky, reinforcing the natural setting. While the water itself may be stylized, its presence and reflective quality must be preserved to maintain the original scene’s atmosphere. This is a minor but important detail with a weight of 1 point.",

The partly cloudy sky with soft blue tones and scattered white clouds provides atmospheric context. While the sky may be enhanced for dramatic effect, its basic structure and lighting should remain consistent to avoid disorienting the viewer. This is a secondary detail with a weight of 1 point.",

These patterns are not individually named in the instruction but are essential for distinguishing the buildings. If replaced entirely with abstract armor plating without retaining any window-like details, the buildings lose their architectural identity.
