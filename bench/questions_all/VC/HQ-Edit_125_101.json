      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "The arabesque pose — with one leg extended behind and arms forming a diagonal line — is the core identity feature of the dancer’s movement. It defines the artistic intent and distinguishes this moment from any other ballet pose. If this posture is lost or significantly altered (e.g., bent knee, arms lowered), the dancer cannot be recognized as performing the same action. Therefore, preserving this exact silhouette is essential for identity retention, making it a 3-point question.",
      "question": "Is the dancer depicted in an arabesque leap with one leg extended behind and arms forming a diagonal line?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The Eiffel Tower’s distinctive lattice framework and tiered structure are globally recognized symbols. Altering its shape (e.g., smoothing edges, removing arches) would make it unrecognizable. Since the instruction requires the tower to be included in the globe, its fundamental form must remain intact. This is a core identification element, hence 3 points.",
      "question": "Does the Eiffel Tower retain its characteristic iron lattice structure and three-tiered design with a spire at the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The dancer’s pointe shoes are a functional and symbolic detail indicating ballet performance. Their presence confirms the dancer’s discipline and technique. Removing or replacing them with flat shoes would fundamentally alter the character’s identity. While stylization may allow minor texture changes, their form must remain clearly identifiable.",
      "question": "Are both feet of the dancer wearing pointe shoes with visible ribbons and box-like structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The dancer’s gaze direction toward the Eiffel Tower establishes narrative focus and spatial logic. Changing the head orientation to look elsewhere breaks the compositional harmony and implied connection between dancer and landmark. This directional alignment supports the scene’s emotional and visual coherence, making it a key relational element worth 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the dancer’s head turned to face the Eiffel Tower, indicating forward gaze toward it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The turquoise color of the leotard is a prominent visual trait distinguishing the dancer’s appearance. While the instruction allows stylization, changing it to a radically different hue (e.g., red or black) without justification would obscure the original aesthetic. The color contributes to the image’s mood and identity, so its retention ensures visual continuity.",
      "question": "Is the dancer wearing a leotard that is predominantly turquoise in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The relative placement of the dancer in front of the Eiffel Tower maintains the scene’s depth and perspective. Moving the dancer behind or beside the tower would distort the intended spatial hierarchy and weaken the visual narrative. This positional relationship is a logical anchor, thus important but not absolute in identity — hence 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the dancer positioned in the foreground, clearly in front of the Eiffel Tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
