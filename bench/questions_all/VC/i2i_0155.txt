Description of reference image: The subject is a potted plant with large, vibrant green leaves, positioned on a windowsill. It sits in a terracotta pot with a matching saucer beneath it. Sunlight streams in from the window behind, softly illuminating the plant and creating a serene ambiance. The background outside the window displays a blurred view of foliage, suggesting a natural outdoor setting.

Thinking process: 
The instructions focus on adding text ("Breathe" and "Calm") while maintaining the image's essence as a plant therapy-themed postcard or meditation wallpaper. The changes primarily involve text addition, and there are no explicit mentions of altering the plant, pot, window, or lighting conditions. Therefore, the core visual elements and scene should remain mostly unchanged.

### Step 1 - Allowed Changes List:
- Add the words "Breathe" at the top left and "Calm" at the bottom right.
- Adjust the color scheme or tone slightly to fit the theme of meditation and calmness, but this should not distort the original appearance significantly.

### Step 2 - Elements that Should Remain Unchanged
Thinking process:
- **Core recognition elements:** The plantâ€™s structure, leaf shape, and color are crucial as they define the plant and contribute to the calming effect. The terracotta pot also contributes significantly to the aesthetic.
- **Functional/logical association elements:** The position of the plant on the windowsill with sunlight streaming in is essential to the tranquil and natural ambiance of the scene. The relationship between the plant, light, and window should remain intact.
- **Other necessary elements:** The soft sunlight and the blurred greenery outside the window support the serene mood, and they should also be preserved.

Preservation Targets List:
- The vibrant green leaves with their natural shape and arrangement.
- The position of the plant on the windowsill.
- The terracotta pot and saucer.
- The warm sunlight and its interaction with the plant.
- The blurred greenery visible through the window.
