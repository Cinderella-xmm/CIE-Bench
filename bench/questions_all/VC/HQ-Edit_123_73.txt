**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a large, stepped Mayan pyramid located in a dense tropical jungle. The pyramid has a tiered structure with nine levels descending from a flat-topped temple at the summit. The temple at the top features two visible rectangular openings on its front face, likely representing doorways or windows. The stone surface of the pyramid shows weathering and erosion, with patches of moss and vegetation growing along the edges and staircases. The steps are wide and steep, forming a central staircase leading up to the temple. The surrounding environment consists of thick green forest with tall trees and varied canopy textures. In the foreground, there is a grassy clearing where several white vehicles (likely tourist cars) are parked near the base of the pyramid, indicating human access. The lighting suggests daytime with sunlight casting distinct shadows from the pyramid onto the ground, enhancing depth and form.

Thinking process:  
The editing instruction specifies transformative changes:  
- "Create a mythical guardian creature from the pyramid" → implies the **entire form** of the pyramid will be reimagined into a creature.  
- "Steps becoming armored body segments" → the **structure of the steps** will be transformed into **armor-like parts**, altering their original function and appearance.  
- "Entrance into a mystical eye" → the **doorway(s)** at the top temple must be converted into an **eye**, changing their shape and purpose.  
- "Surrounding jungle into intricate vine-like scales" → the **jungle foliage** will be stylized into **vine patterns resembling scales**, modifying texture and form.  
- "Base integrates ancient stone patterns" → the **base of the pyramid** will incorporate **decorative motifs**, possibly derived from existing carvings.  
- "Surround with luminescent flora inspired by temple details" → introduces **new glowing plants** based on temple design elements.

From this analysis:  
- The **pyramid’s structural form** (tiered steps, central staircase, temple top) is **allowed to change** as it becomes part of a creature.  
- The **entrance** (doorways) is explicitly changed into an eye → **not preserved**.  
- The **jungle** is transformed into vine-scales → **not preserved** in original form.  
- The **vehicles** are not mentioned → **may be removed or altered**.  
- The **stone texture** of the pyramid may be retained **if used as inspiration for armor or patterns**, but not necessarily as-is.

Allowed Changes List:  
- The shape and function of the pyramid’s steps (transformed into armored segments)  
- The entrance/doorways (replaced with a mystical eye)  
- The surrounding jungle (transformed into vine-like scales)  
- The vehicles (may be removed or integrated into the fantasy scene)  
- The overall silhouette and spatial arrangement of the pyramid (altered to resemble a creature)  
- The lighting and color palette (can shift to enhance fantasy effect)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements:  
- The **pyramid's stepped structure** is iconic to Mayan architecture, especially Chichen Itza-style temples. While the *form* may change, the **presence of stepped tiers** should still reflect the original architectural logic. However, since the instruction says “steps become armored body segments,” this **allows transformation**, so it is not a fixed element.  
- The **temple at the top** is a key feature—its **rectangular form** and **flat roof** are essential to identifying the structure as a Mayan pyramid. Even if transformed, the **top platform** must retain some visual continuity with the original.  
- The **stone material** and **weathered texture** are critical to authenticity. While the texture may be stylized, the **original grayish stone tone** and **erosion patterns** should remain recognizable to preserve the ancient feel.  
- The **central staircase** is a defining feature of such pyramids; though it becomes "armored," its **position and alignment** should logically follow the original path.

Functional/logical association elements:  
- The **relationship between the pyramid and the jungle** is logical—ancient ruins surrounded by nature. The transformation into a creature with vine-scales maintains this relationship but reinterprets it. Thus, the **spatial integration** of the pyramid within the jungle must be preserved, even if stylized.  
- The **orientation** of the pyramid (facing forward with central staircase) must remain consistent to maintain spatial coherence.

Non-modified element deduction:  
After excluding allowed changes:  
- The **stone material** (texture, color, erosion) must be retained as a foundational element.  
- The **original layout of the pyramid’s tiers** (number and relative height) should be preserved in scale, even if morphed into armor.  
- The **presence of the temple atop the pyramid** must remain, even if transformed into an eye.  
- The **overall location** of the pyramid in the jungle must be maintained—no relocation.  
- The **angle of sunlight and shadow direction** should be consistent to preserve realism, unless altered for dramatic effect (but instruction does not specify).

Preservation Targets List:  
- The **grayish stone texture** of the pyramid’s surface  
- The **rectangular temple platform** at the top  
- The **central staircase** running down the front face  
- The **nine-tiered structure** (number and stacking pattern)  
- The **position and orientation** of the pyramid within the jungle  
- The **presence of moss and vegetation** on the pyramid’s edges (as evidence of age and natural integration)  
- The **original lighting direction** (sunlight from upper left casting shadows to lower right)

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

Q1:  
Thinking process: The **grayish stone texture** is a core identity feature of the pyramid, distinguishing it from other structures. Its weathered surface with darkened areas and erosion lines is essential to recognizing it as an ancient Mesoamerican ruin. If replaced with smooth or metallic textures without trace of original material, the authenticity is lost. This element is crucial for historical and architectural identification, making it a weight-3 element.  
Question: Is the original grayish stone texture of the pyramid’s surface retained, including visible weathering and erosion patterns?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3

Q2:  
Thinking process: The **rectangular temple platform** at the top is a unique architectural feature of Mayan pyramids like El Castillo. Its flat roof and defined edges are key identifiers. Even if transformed into an eye, the **basic rectangular shape** must remain to preserve the original structure’s identity. Losing this would make the structure unrecognizable as a Mayan pyramid.  
Question: Is the top platform of the pyramid preserved as a flat, rectangular structure with defined edges?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3

Q3:  
Thinking process: The **central staircase** is a functional and iconic element of the pyramid, running down the front face. Its position and alignment are essential to the pyramid’s symmetry and design. Even if transformed into armored segments, the **path and placement** must follow the original staircase. Altering its position would disrupt the spatial logic of the structure.  
Question: Does the central staircase remain aligned along the front face of the pyramid, extending from the top temple to the base?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3

Q4:  
Thinking process: The **nine-tiered structure** is a specific architectural detail that defines this type of pyramid. Each tier decreases in size as it ascends, creating a stepped pyramid. Even if morphed into armored segments, the **number and stacking sequence** must be preserved to maintain structural accuracy. Losing this would alter the pyramid’s identity.  
Question: Are there exactly nine distinct tiers visible in the pyramid’s structure, decreasing in size from bottom to top?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3

Q5:  
Thinking process: The **presence of moss and vegetation** on the edges and steps indicates natural aging and integration with the environment. This detail adds authenticity and visual coherence. While the jungle around it may be transformed, the **vegetation growing directly on the pyramid** should remain as evidence of its ancient state. Removing it would make the structure appear artificially clean or new.  
Question: Are patches of moss and small vegetation visible along the edges and steps of the pyramid?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2

Q6:  
Thinking process: The **original lighting direction** (sunlight from upper left casting shadows to lower right) creates depth and realism. Preserving this ensures the scene remains visually coherent and grounded in reality, even if fantastical elements are added. Changing light direction without reason would distort spatial perception.  
Question: Is the shadow cast by the pyramid positioned to the lower right, consistent with sunlight coming from the upper left?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2

Q7:  
Thinking process: The **position of the pyramid within the jungle** is a key environmental context. It must remain centered in a dense forest, with trees surrounding it on all sides. Moving it or isolating it would break the original scene’s logic. This spatial relationship is important for maintaining the sense of discovery and isolation typical of ancient ruins.  
Question: Is the pyramid located in the center of a dense tropical jungle, with trees surrounding it on all sides?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2

Q8:  
Thinking process: The **moss-covered top platform** is a subtle but significant detail—indicating long-term exposure and natural growth. While the top may become an eye, the **surface should retain traces of moss or organic material**, reflecting the original condition. This supports the narrative of ancientness and integration with nature.  
Question: Is the top platform of the pyramid covered with dry soil and patches of moss, indicating natural overgrowth?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1

Q9:  
Thinking process: The **white vehicles** in the foreground are minor but real-world elements. While they may be removed or stylized, their presence provides scale and modern contrast. If removed entirely without replacement, it could affect the viewer’s understanding of scale. However, since they are not core to the pyramid’s identity, their retention is secondary.  
Question: Are there multiple white vehicles parked on the grassy area near the base of the pyramid?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1
