If removed or obscured, the camera loses its identifiable brand identity, which is a core element of the original image. Even in stylized form, it must remain visible or clearly derivable. This is a key functional and identity element, thus weighted 3 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The camera lens is the most prominent functional component of the camera. Its circular shape and positioning directly in front of the body are essential for recognizing it as a camera. Altering or removing it would fundamentally change the object's identity. This is a core recognition element, hence 3 points.",

If only one hand holds it or it floats, the functional logic breaks. This is a critical scene element for maintaining coherence, so it must be preserved. Weighted 2 points.",

Their loss would alter the clothing identity significantly. While stylization may simplify them, they must remain present in some form. Weighted 1 point.",
