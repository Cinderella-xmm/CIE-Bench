      "thinking_process": "The **pyramid** is a core landmark in the original image and serves as a definitive identifier of the location (Giza). Its presence and silhouette are essential for situational recognition. Removing or altering it would sever the connection to the real-world context, making the image unrecognizable as a depiction of the Giza plateau. This is a 3-point element due to its role in identity and location verification.",
      "question": "Is the pyramid visible in the background to the right of the Sphinx, with a clear triangular silhouette against the sunset sky?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The **sun’s position at the horizon** is central to the lighting and mood of the scene. It defines the time of day (sunset) and casts directional light across the Sphinx and clouds. Altering its position or removing it would destroy the atmospheric integrity and thematic intent. This is a 3-point element because it governs the entire lighting scheme and temporal setting.",
      "question": "Is the sun positioned low on the horizon, directly behind the Sphinx, emitting a bright circular glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The **cloud layer beneath the Sphinx** creates a surreal, elevated appearance and reflects the warm light of the sunset. Its presence is crucial for the dreamlike quality of the image. Removing or significantly altering it would eliminate this key visual effect and disrupt the balance between earth and sky. This is a 2-point element as it enhances the scene’s atmosphere without being a primary identifier.",
      "question": "Is there a dense layer of clouds below the Sphinx, appearing illuminated with orange and pink hues from the sunset?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The **Sphinx’s orientation (facing right)** is a defining feature of its iconic profile view. Changing this would alter the viewer’s perception and break continuity with established imagery. While the head will be replaced, the directionality remains part of the original composition and must be preserved for consistency. This is a 2-point element due to its importance in composition and perspective.",
      "question": "Is the Sphinx facing toward the right side of the image, with its profile visible?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The **sky gradient** from orange near the horizon to purple and pink higher up is a signature feature of the sunset lighting. It contributes to the emotional tone and visual harmony of the scene. Any deviation in color progression would make the image appear unnatural or inconsistent with the original. This is a 1-point element because it supports the aesthetic rather than identity.",
      "question": "Does the sky show a smooth gradient from warm orange near the horizon to cooler purple and pink tones at the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The **eroded stone base and layered texture of the Sphinx** are physical details that confirm its ancient, weathered nature. These textures are part of the original monument’s character and must remain even if the upper form is transformed. Losing them would make the structure appear unreal or digitally fabricated without historical grounding. This is a 1-point element due to its detail-level significance.",
      "question": "Are there visible horizontal erosion lines and layered textures on the lower portion of the Sphinx’s body?",
      "choices": [

      "thinking_process": "The **partial sand coverage around the base of the Sphinx** reinforces its desert location and adds realism. This detail grounds the image in its environment and should not be removed, especially since the editing focuses on mythological enhancement rather than environmental abstraction. This is a 1-point element as it contributes to environmental authenticity.",
      "question": "Is there sand visible around the base of the Sphinx, particularly near the front paws and lower body?",
