      "thinking_process": "The three-pointed star emblem is the definitive brand identifier of Mercedes-Benz and is essential for recognizing the car as a Mercedes product. Its presence and central positioning on the grille are non-negotiable for maintaining brand identity. Even if stylized as a control element, the core shape and placement must be preserved. Loss of this emblem would result in misidentification of the car’s make.",

      "thinking_process": "The gullwing doors are a defining characteristic of the SLS AMG, distinguishing it from other Mercedes models. Their upward-opening motion and hinge location are iconic. Although instructed to transform them into shoulder buttons, their physical position and orientation must be preserved to maintain the car’s identity. Altering their placement or removal would break recognition.",
      "question": "Are the gullwing doors open upward from the roofline, hinged at the top?",

      "thinking_process": "The side air intake with a vertical slit is a unique design feature specific to the SLS AMG, contributing to its aggressive aesthetic. It is located just behind the front wheel and is visually distinct. This element helps differentiate it from other sports cars and must remain intact to preserve the car’s identity.",
      "question": "Is there a vertical slit-shaped air intake on the side of the car, just behind the front wheel?",

      "thinking_process": "The \"SLS\" badge near the rear wheel arch is a model-specific identifier. It confirms the car is an SLS AMG rather than another variant. Its position and text must be preserved to maintain authenticity, even if stylized or integrated into a new design language.",
      "question": "Is the \"SLS\" badge visible on the side of the car near the rear wheel arch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The multi-spoke alloy wheels are a signature design element of the SLS AMG, contributing to its sporty appearance. While the instruction allows for transformation, the wheel’s overall shape and spoke pattern must remain consistent to maintain visual coherence with the original vehicle. Changing them drastically would alter the car’s identity.",
      "question": "Do the wheels have a multi-spoke alloy design with a five-spoke pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The white leather interior seats are a key detail visible through the open doors. They contribute to the car’s luxurious and sporty character. Even if the interior is reimagined as a controller interface, the color and material contrast must be preserved to maintain consistency with the original image.",
      "question": "Are the interior seats white in color and made of leather?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The license plate \"S MC 197\" with the blue German registration strip is a specific detail that anchors the car in reality. It provides contextual information about origin and registration. Unless the instruction specifies replacing it, it must remain in its original position and format to preserve authenticity.",
      "question": "Is the license plate reading \"S MC 197\" with a blue German flag strip on the left?",
      "choices": [

      "question_id": "Q8",
      "thinking_process": "The overall silhouette—low profile, long hood, short rear deck, and wide stance—is fundamental to identifying the SLS AMG. Even if transformed into a gaming controller, the basic outline must reflect the original car’s proportions to maintain reference integrity. Deviating significantly would lose the connection to the source.",
      "question": "Does the car maintain a low-slung, long-hooded silhouette with a short rear deck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
