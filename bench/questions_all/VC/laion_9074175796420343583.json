      "thinking_process": "The lattice design is the most iconic feature of the pie in the original image. It is what makes this pie distinct from others. The instruction explicitly states to retain it as a patterned apron, meaning its visual structure must remain recognizable—even if recontextualized. If the lattice is removed or replaced with solid crust, the pie loses its identity. Thus, preserving the crisscross pattern of pastry strips is essential.",
      "question": "Is the crisscross lattice pattern of pastry strips visible on the pie's surface?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The knife is central to both the original image and the narrative transformation. It is described as being wielded like a feather pen, which implies the object must still be recognizable as a knife—especially its blade and wooden handle. If these features are changed (e.g., turned into a quill without resembling a knife), the visual logic of the joke breaks down. Therefore, the knife’s form must be preserved.",
      "question": "Is the knife with a metallic blade and wooden handle clearly present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The powdered sugar is a key textural and aesthetic detail in the original image. It enhances the visual appeal and identifies the pie as freshly prepared. While not explicitly mentioned in the instruction, it is a defining characteristic of the pie’s appearance. Removing it would alter the visual identity significantly, especially since it contrasts with the golden crust and dark filling.",
      "question": "Is a fine dusting of white powdered sugar visible on the surface of the pie, particularly over the lattice?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The golden-brown color of the crust is a core visual attribute indicating proper baking and contributing to the pie’s realism. It differentiates it from underbaked or burnt versions. Since the instruction does not allow changing the pie’s fundamental appearance, and the crust color is integral to its identity, it must be retained. Altering it to a pale or dark tone would misrepresent the original.",
      "question": "Is the pie crust uniformly golden brown in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The dark red fruit filling visible through the lattice gaps is essential for identifying the pie’s contents. It provides contrast and suggests flavor (e.g., berry). While the instruction allows reinterpretation, the presence of this color and its visibility through the lattice are critical for maintaining visual coherence with the original. If the filling is obscured or changed to another color, the pie’s identity is compromised.",
      "question": "Are dark red sections of fruit filling visible through the gaps in the lattice crust?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
