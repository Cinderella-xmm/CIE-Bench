It is positioned at the top-right of the head and includes dangling tassels, distinguishing it from generic hair accessories. If removed or replaced, the character loses a key cultural and visual signature. This element is essential for recognition and must be preserved even in chibi form.",

      "thinking_process": "The obi is a functional and symbolic component of the kimono. Its red-and-yellow patterned bow is a distinct feature, visible from the back. Changing its color scheme or removing it would alter the garment’s authenticity. Even in chibi form, the bow must remain present and identifiable.",
      "question": "Is there a wide obi tied at the waist with a red-and-yellow patterned bow visible from the back?",

      "thinking_process": "The kimono’s base color is dark blue, serving as a contrast to the bright floral patterns. This color choice is integral to the aesthetic balance and cultural representation. Altering it to a non-blue hue would fundamentally change the garment’s identity.",
      "question": "Does the kimono have a dark blue base color with floral patterns overlaid?",

      "thinking_process": "The floral patterns on the kimono are specifically cherry blossom-inspired, featuring pink, red, and white flowers. These are not random designs but culturally significant symbols of spring. Their presence ensures thematic consistency. Even if colors are intensified, the **type of pattern** must remain recognizable.",
      "question": "Are the floral patterns on the kimono composed of pink, red, and white blossoms resembling cherry blossoms?",

      "thinking_process": "The figure is clearly female, wearing a traditional kimono with a formal hairstyle. This gender and cultural identity are central to the image’s meaning. In chibi form, the silhouette and accessories must still convey this identity. Any change to gender expression or cultural markers would break continuity.",
      "question": "Is the figure depicted as a woman wearing a traditional Japanese kimono?",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "Cherry blossoms are not only in the background but also part of the kimono design and implied in the setting. The thematic link to spring is established through their presence. Even if the background is changed, the **symbolic use of cherry blossoms** must remain in the form of props (branches, petals) in the chibi versions.",
      "question": "Are cherry blossoms present either in the kimono pattern or as props (e.g., branch, falling petals) in the figure’s immediate vicinity?",

      "thinking_process": "The figure stands in a sideways pose, facing right, with the head slightly turned. While the pose may vary in chibi versions, the **side profile orientation** is a key compositional feature. At least one of the four magnets should retain this view to ensure continuity.",
