### Step 1 - Allowed Changes List & Description of Reference Image:

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject of the image consists of a tan leather baseball glove and a white baseball with red stitching. The glove has detailed black stitching and lies open on a green grassy surface. The ball rests inside the glove, positioned slightly towards the viewer. The background is an out-of-focus green lawn, providing a natural outdoor setting.

**Thinking Process:**  
Analyzing the instructions indicates that the form of the baseball and the glove can be transformed into top, side, and sectional views for product catalogs. The background and scene can change depending on the catalog design requirement.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
1. The baseball and glove can be depicted in different views (top, side, sectional).  
2. The background can be replaced with one suitable for a product catalog or manual.  
3. Lighting, shadows, and color tones can be adjusted for catalog presentation.

### Step 2 - Preservation Targets List:

**Thinking Process:**  
**Core Recognition Elements:**  
- The material texture of the glove (tan leather with black stitching) and the ball (white color with red stitching).  
- The overall shape of the baseball and glove must be preserved in any view.  

**Logical Association Elements:**  
- The relationship between the glove and ball should remain intact, indicating their association as sports equipment.  

**Remaining Element Retention:**

**Preservation Targets List:**  
(Element 1: Material Textures of the Glove and Ball)  
(Element 2: Overall Shape of the Baseball and Glove)  
(Element 3: Relationship Between the Glove and Ball)  
(Element 4: Color Scheme of Glove and Ball)
