**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

Description of reference image:  
The subject is a modern, minimalist library interior constructed primarily from natural wood materials. The ceiling features exposed wooden beams with horizontal slats that allow dappled sunlight to filter through, creating striped patterns on the floor. A series of tall, built-in wooden shelves line one wall, divided into uniform cubbies containing books, decorative objects, and small sculptures. Three woven rattan chairs with lattice backrests are arranged in front of the shelves, each paired with a cylindrical wicker side table. Two large, dome-shaped hanging lamps made of woven natural fiber hang from the ceiling at different heights. The flooring is light-toned wooden planks laid horizontally, contributing to the warm, cohesive aesthetic. Natural light enters from the right side, casting strong directional shadows across the space. The overall color palette is monochromatic golden-brown, emphasizing texture and material harmony.

Thinking process:  
The editing instruction explicitly transforms the entire scene into a whimsical woodland creature habitat. It specifies changes to:
- Shelves → wooden wings adorned with leaves
- Hanging lamps → luminescent fungi
- Seating → moss-covered rocks
- Books → bird-like creatures with text-covered feathers
- Ceiling → canopy of entwined branches

This indicates that **all structural forms** (shelves, seating, lamps, ceiling) are to be reimagined in fantastical terms. However, no mention is made of altering the **material essence** (wooden texture), **lighting pattern**, or **spatial layout**—only their symbolic form. Since the transformation is metaphorical and stylistic rather than physical destruction, we infer that **the original spatial configuration and functional roles** must remain logically consistent even if visually transformed.

Allowed Changes List:  
- Form of shelves (from rectangular cubbies to wing-like structures)  
- Form of hanging lamps (from woven baskets to glowing fungi)  
- Form of chairs and stools (from rattan furniture to mossy rocks)  
- Form of books (from paper-bound volumes to feathered bird creatures)  
- Form of ceiling beams (from linear wooden slats to entwined branches)  
- Visual style (transition from realistic to whimsical/imaginative)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements:  
Although the instruction allows for radical transformation of object forms, certain **visual identifiers** rooted in the original image’s structure and composition must persist to maintain coherence between the original and edited versions. These include:
- The **arrangement of shelves** along the left wall in a continuous grid pattern — this spatial logic is essential for identifying the room as a library.
- The **presence of three distinct seating units** positioned in front of the shelves — their number and relative spacing define the reading zone.
- The **two hanging lamps** suspended at different depths — their dual presence and placement help anchor the lighting design.
- The **directional sunlight** creating striped shadows on the floor — this defines the source of illumination and time of day.
- The **flooring pattern** of horizontal wooden planks — while possibly textured differently, its orientation and continuity support spatial depth.

Functional/logical association elements:  
- The **relationship between shelves and seating**: seats face the shelves, indicating a reading function. This functional layout must be preserved even if objects are transformed.
- The **position of lamps above seating areas**: they should still provide overhead illumination, suggesting fungi must appear in similar positions.
- The **flow of light from the right side**: the directionality of shadows must remain consistent to preserve environmental realism within the fantasy context.

Non-modified element deduction:  
After excluding allowed changes (forms of objects), remaining unmentioned but visible details must be retained for visual consistency:
- The **texture of wood grain** on surfaces (walls, floor, shelves) — though stylized, it should not disappear entirely.
- The **uniformity of shelf divisions** — even if shaped like wings, they must retain the same modular rhythm.
- The **spacing between furniture** — the distance between chairs and tables must reflect original proportions.
- The **overall warm golden tone** — while hues may shift slightly, the dominant color palette must remain consistent to preserve mood.

Preservation Targets List:  
- The spatial layout of three chairs aligned in front of the shelving unit  
- The two hanging lamps positioned above the seating area  
- The directional sunlight casting diagonal striped shadows across the floor  
- The continuous wall of shelves forming a grid pattern along the left wall  
- The horizontal plank flooring with consistent orientation  
- The functional relationship between seating and bookshelves  
- The warm golden-brown color scheme as the dominant tone  
- The presence and position of decorative objects on shelves (e.g., vases, figurines)

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

Q1:  
Thinking process: The alignment of three chairs directly facing the shelving unit is a core functional and spatial feature. Changing their number or orientation would disrupt the intended use of the space as a reading nook. This arrangement is critical for maintaining the logical layout of the room, even when transformed into a fantasy setting. Therefore, preserving this specific configuration ensures continuity in purpose and visual narrative.  
Question: Are there exactly three chairs positioned in a row, facing the bookshelf wall?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The two hanging lamps are key lighting fixtures whose positions define the ambient illumination. Their placement above the seating area establishes a focal point for comfort and reading. Even if transformed into fungi, their locations must remain unchanged to preserve the spatial hierarchy and lighting logic. Removing or relocating them would break the scene’s functional integrity.  
Question: Are there two hanging pendant lights located above the seating area, one closer to the center and one toward the right edge of the frame?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The striped shadow pattern created by sunlight filtering through the ceiling slats is a defining visual motif. It conveys time of day, architectural structure, and natural light behavior. Altering this pattern would remove a crucial environmental cue and destroy the sense of place. While the ceiling itself may become a branch canopy, the shadow direction and spacing must remain consistent.  
Question: Does the floor display a pattern of parallel diagonal shadows cast by sunlight entering from the right side?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The continuous wall of shelves with uniform cubby compartments is the primary identifier of the space as a library. Even if reshaped into wings, the underlying grid structure must be preserved in terms of density, height, and span. Disrupting this grid would obscure the original function and visual identity of the room.  
Question: Is there a full-height wall of wooden shelves running along the left side of the room, divided into multiple evenly spaced rectangular compartments?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The horizontal plank flooring with consistent orientation provides a stable ground plane and contributes to the room’s warmth and cohesion. Its directionality affects perspective and movement. While texture may change (e.g., moss), the alignment and continuity of the planks must be maintained to preserve spatial depth and realism.  
Question: Is the floor composed of light-colored wooden planks laid horizontally, extending from foreground to background?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The presence of decorative objects on the shelves (such as vases, figurines, and boxes) adds visual interest and confirms the shelves’ role as display units. These items are minor but contribute to the authenticity of the scene. Their retention ensures that the transformed shelves still resemble curated storage spaces, even if now magical.  
Question: Are there small decorative objects placed within some of the shelf cubbies, including a white vase and a blue box with text?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The warm golden-brown color scheme is central to the atmosphere of the room. It unifies all materials and enhances the natural aesthetic. While tones may shift slightly in a whimsical version, the dominance of warm earth tones must be preserved to maintain emotional and visual continuity.  
Question: Is the dominant color palette throughout the room composed of warm golden-brown hues across walls, ceiling, furniture, and flooring?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2
