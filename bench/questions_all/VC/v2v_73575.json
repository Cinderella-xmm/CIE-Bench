      "thinking_process": "The diptych format is a fundamental structural feature of the original image, dividing the composition into two distinct panels. This layout is not mentioned in the editing instruction as something to be altered, and removing it would fundamentally change the image’s organization. The presence of two separate panels is a key visual element that defines the relationship between the two birds. Losing this would make the image appear as a single scene rather than a comparative pair, undermining the original intent. Therefore, preserving the two-panel structure is essential for visual consistency and is a core compositional element.",
      "question": "Is the image composed of two separate panels, with one bird on the left and one on the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The position of the birds—left bird on the left panel, right bird on the right panel—is a core spatial arrangement that must be preserved. The instruction does not suggest swapping or merging the birds, nor does it imply a change in their lateral placement. Reversing or combining them would disrupt the original composition’s balance and intent. This positional relationship is a key identifier of the image’s structure and must remain unchanged.",
      "question": "Is the bird that was originally on the left still located in the left panel, and the bird that was originally on the right still located in the right panel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The orientation of the left bird—facing forward with its head turned slightly to the right—is a distinctive pose that contributes to its identity in the original image. The instruction does not specify changing this posture, only transforming its form. Therefore, the transformed origami bird must maintain this same head turn and forward-facing stance to preserve the original’s visual logic. This orientation is a key detail that distinguishes it from the other bird and must be retained.",
      "question": "Does the bird on the left have its head turned toward the viewer, with its beak slightly open and facing forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The right bird’s profile view, with its back partially visible and facing left, is a defining characteristic of its original pose. The instruction does not alter this orientation, only the material and form. Preserving this angle ensures continuity in the visual narrative. The transformed crystalline bird must retain this same side profile to maintain consistency with the original. This is a key relational element between the two birds and must be preserved.",
      "question": "Does the bird on the right have its body angled such that its back is partially visible and it is facing left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The presence of feet and claws gripping a surface is a functional detail that supports the birds’ perching action. Even though the perch itself is replaced, the act of standing on a support must be preserved. The original image shows clear claw grips on the rock, and this interaction must be maintained in the transformed version to ensure logical coherence. Losing this would make the birds appear floating or unsupported, breaking the physical logic of the scene.",
      "question": "Are the feet of both birds clearly shown gripping a surface beneath them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The general silhouette of each bird—upright, balanced, with a defined head, body, and tail—is a secondary but important detail that helps maintain the avian form even after transformation. While the internal structure changes, the outer shape must remain recognizable as a bird in stance. This silhouette is not explicitly changed by the instruction and is necessary for visual coherence. It is a minor but consistent feature that aids in identifying the transformed figures as derived from the original.",
      "question": "Do both birds maintain an upright, balanced silhouette with a distinct head, body, and tail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
