Description of reference image:  
The subject is a white standard poodle standing upright on a wooden surface, facing forward with its head slightly tilted. The poodle has a meticulously groomed, fluffy coat with a rounded head shape, large poofy ears, and voluminous legs resembling cotton balls. It wears a white layered dress with ruffles, resembling a couture-style ball gown, and a silver heart-shaped pendant necklace around its neck. The background features the iconic Sydney Opera House with its distinctive sail-like shells under a soft golden-hour sky, reflecting gently on the water below. The lighting is warm and diffused, suggesting late afternoon or early evening. The composition places the poodle in the foreground, centered, with the Opera House softly blurred but clearly identifiable in the mid-background.

Thinking process:  
First, analyze the editing instructions word by word to determine what can be changed. The instruction explicitly states:  
- "Design a digital character card styled like an RPG collectible" → this implies the entire presentation format will change (e.g., frame, stats, layout), so the original photo-realistic style must be transformed.  
- "Feature the elegant white poodle in a couture dress as the heroine, 'Opera Duchess'" → confirms the subject remains the same poodle, but now reimagined as a character; thus, the identity of the poodle is preserved, but its representation may be stylized.  
- "Use a polished 3D cartoon look emphasizing fluffy coat, layered skirt, and heart pendant" → indicates that the visual style changes to 3D cartoon, but key features (fluffy coat, dress, pendant) must remain visually present.  
- "Add stat bars: [Elegance +10], [Agility +8], [Charisma +9], [Fashion Sense +10]" → new elements added; not part of original.  
- "Place a gilded title banner at the top and a silver nameplate at the bottom with her class: 'Glamour Bard'" → new UI elements; not in original.  
- "Frame the card with beveled metallic edges" → new framing; original has no border.  
- "Use a stylized harbor backdrop echoing the Sydney Opera House" → background must be retained in essence (Opera House), but stylized (i.e., simplified or artistic version).  

Thus, **allowed changes** include:  
- Visual style (from realistic photo to 3D cartoon)  
- Addition of UI elements (stats, banners, frame)  
- Stylization of background (but still based on Opera House)  
- Characterization as “Opera Duchess” and “Glamour Bard” (identity label)  

However, **not allowed to change**:  
- The core identity of the subject (white poodle)  
- Key visual attributes of the poodle (fluffy coat, specific grooming style, heart pendant)  
- The presence and recognizable form of the Sydney Opera House in the background  
- The layered white dress and its structure  
- The position and orientation of the poodle (standing front-facing)  

Allowed Changes List:  
(Specific element 1 that allows for changes): Visual style of the image (realistic → 3D cartoon)  
(Specific element 2 that allows for changes): Background texture and rendering (photorealistic water and sky → stylized harbor)  
(Specific element 3 that allows for changes): Addition of digital UI elements (stat bars, banners, frame)  
(Specific element 4 that allows for changes): Color tone and lighting intensity (within reasonable range for stylization)  
(Specific element 5 that allows for changes): Proportion and perspective of background elements (as long as Opera House is recognizable)  

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements:  
- The white poodle is the central subject. Its identity hinges on being a poodle — specifically, a standard poodle with a show-cut grooming style (round head, poofy ears, leg pom-poms). These are essential for identification.  
- The Sydney Opera House is an iconic landmark. Its distinctive shell-like architecture must remain recognizable even if stylized. The number and general arrangement of sails (at least five visible) are critical.  
- The white dress with layered ruffles and the heart pendant are unique accessories that define the character’s appearance and should be preserved in form, even if rendered differently.  

Functional/logical association elements:  
- The poodle stands in front of the Opera House — this spatial relationship must be preserved to maintain the scene logic. Even if stylized, the poodle should appear in the foreground with the Opera House behind it.  
- The heart pendant is attached to the dog’s neck; its position relative to the collar/dress must be maintained to avoid visual inconsistency.  

Non-modified element deduction:  
After excluding allowed changes (style, UI, background rendering), the following must remain unchanged:  
- The poodle’s breed-specific features (fluffiness, ear shape, leg volume)  
- The white color of the fur and dress  
- The presence and shape of the heart pendant  
- The architectural silhouette of the Opera House (sail shapes, angles)  
- The overall pose of the poodle (front-facing, standing)  

Preservation Targets List:  
(The white poodle with a show-cut grooming style)  
(The white layered dress with ruffles)  
(The heart-shaped pendant necklace)  
(The Sydney Opera House with its distinctive sail-like shells)  
(The poodle positioned in front of the Opera House)

Q1:  
Thinking process: The poodle's show-cut grooming style — including the round head, poofy ears, and voluminous leg pom-poms — is the defining feature of its breed and identity. If these are altered (e.g., flattened, streamlined), it would no longer resemble a standard poodle. This is a core recognition element, making it essential to preserve. Losing this would result in misidentification of the subject.  
Question: Does the poodle retain its characteristic show-cut grooming with a round head, large poofy ears, and fluffy leg pom-poms?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The white layered dress with ruffles is a key accessory that defines the character’s elegance and fashion sense. It is central to the "couture dress" description and must be preserved in form, even if stylized. Removing or altering the layers would violate the intended visual identity.  
Question: Is the white layered dress with ruffled tiers visibly present on the poodle?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The heart-shaped pendant is a specific detail that adds character and continuity. It is described as part of the outfit and serves as a symbolic accessory. Its presence and shape are important for consistency with the original image.  
Question: Is there a heart-shaped pendant hanging from the poodle’s neck?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The Sydney Opera House is a globally recognized landmark. Its sail-like shells must be recognizable in the background. Even if stylized, the number and angular arrangement of the shells (at least five distinct structures) must be preserved to maintain scene authenticity.  
Question: Are the distinctive sail-like shells of the Sydney Opera House visible in the background?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The spatial relationship between the poodle and the Opera House is crucial. The poodle must remain in the foreground, standing before the building. Changing this would disrupt the logical composition and context of the image.  
Question: Is the poodle positioned in the foreground with the Sydney Opera House behind it?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The white color of the poodle’s fur is a core visual trait. While slight tonal shifts may occur in stylization, the overall white hue must be preserved to maintain species and breed accuracy. A significant color change (e.g., gray or cream) would alter identity.  
Question: Is the poodle’s fur predominantly white in color?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The dress is white, matching the poodle’s fur. This color coordination is part of the aesthetic and must be preserved. A different dress color would contradict the original design.  
Question: Is the dress worn by the poodle white in color?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1
