Description of reference image: The image depicts an office setting with two individuals seated across from each other at a desk, each working on a computer displaying another person’s video call interface. Both individuals wear orange sweaters over collared shirts and black pants, and one has long black hair while the other has short dark hair. The environment features a clean and organized look with potted plants flanking either side of the desk, framed portraits of two men hung on the wall behind the woman, and a modern overhead lamp directed towards the man.

### Step 1 - Allowed Changes List:

Thinking process: 
The instructions require combining multiple views (front, side, and top) showing the office setup. This calls for adjusting the perspective and adding angles. However, this doesn’t give freedom to alter specific elements like colors, furniture type, or the people depicted unless explicitly stated.
  
Allowed Changes List:
- The perspective of the image (creating front, side, and top views while keeping the same content).
- The lighting effects (to adapt them for different views, but the primary light source should remain consistent).
