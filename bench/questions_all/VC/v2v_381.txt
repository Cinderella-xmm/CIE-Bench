### Step 1: Analyzing Allowed Changes and Determining Reference Image Details

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a stone pyramid structure with a triangular roof and a central entrance. The pyramid is constructed from neatly arranged rectangular stones, with a symmetrical design. The entrance is framed by two columns and a lintel, leading into a dark interior. The pyramid stands on a paved area surrounded by greenery, including trees and grass under a partly cloudy sky.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instructions specify transforming the pyramid into five chibi-style Russian nesting dolls while retaining pyramid-inspired designs. This means the pyramid's iconic shape and design elements should be reflected in the dolls. The scene is to be replaced with a wooden table, indicating that the background and setting can be altered. However, the pyramid's core design elements must be preserved in the dolls.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
1. The pyramid's physical form can be changed to five chibi-style Russian nesting dolls.
2. The scene can be replaced with a wooden table.
3. The number of pyramids is adjusted to five.
4. The size of the pyramids is adjusted to fit the nesting doll concept.
5. The aspect ratio of the image is changed to a horizontal 3:2.

### Step 2: Determining Elements That Should Remain Unchanged

**Thinking process:**  
Core recognition elements include the pyramid's iconic triangular shape and design motifs, such as the stone texture and symmetrical structure. Functional/logical elements involve the arrangement of the nesting dolls in descending size order. Remaining elements, like the stone texture and design details, should be retained for visual coherence.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
1. Pyramid-inspired design elements (triangular shape, stone texture, symmetrical structure).
2. Descending size order of the nesting dolls.
3. Stone texture and design details.

### Step 3: Generating Yes/No Questions

**Q1:**  
Thinking process: The triangular shape is a core recognition feature of the pyramid. Losing this would make the dolls unrecognizable as pyramid-inspired.  
Question: Do the nesting dolls maintain a triangular shape inspired by the pyramid?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

**Q2:**  
Thinking process: The stone texture is a unique detail that distinguishes the pyramid. Retaining this helps maintain visual consistency.  
Question: Do the nesting dolls retain the stone texture seen in the original pyramid?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

**Q3:**  
Thinking process: The symmetrical structure is an important design element of the pyramid. Maintaining symmetry ensures the dolls are recognizable as pyramid-inspired.  
Question: Are the nesting dolls designed with a symmetrical structure similar to the original pyramid?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

**Q4:**  
Thinking process: The arrangement in descending size order is a functional/logical element necessary for nesting dolls.  
Question: Are the nesting dolls arranged in descending size order on the wooden table?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

**Q5:**  
Thinking process: The central entrance is a distinctive feature of the pyramid. Including this in the design helps maintain the pyramid's identity.  
Question: Do the largest nesting doll and possibly others incorporate a design element resembling the pyramid's central entrance?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2
