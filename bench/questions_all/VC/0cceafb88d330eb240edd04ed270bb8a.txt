Description of reference image: The subject is a young woman depicted in a three-quarter profile, facing slightly to the left, with her gaze directed toward the viewer. She wears a richly patterned headscarf composed of golden-yellow fabric with diagonal stripes in purple, blue, and red, draped over her head and cascading down her back. Her facial features are finely rendered—dark eyes, arched eyebrows, a straight nose, and full lips—with soft rosy cheeks. She holds a partially opened pomegranate in both hands, its red outer skin cracked open to reveal bright red seeds inside. The fruit is held close to her body, near the lower chest area. Her attire includes a layered garment: an off-white inner robe with subtle stitching details, overlaid by a dark brown outer vest with intricate blue embroidery along the collar and shoulder seams. A silver bracelet adorns her right wrist. Her left ear features a large, ornate earring made of silver with dangling red gemstones and small circular accents. The background is a plain, textured off-white surface, providing neutral contrast that emphasizes the figure. The lighting is soft and directional, highlighting the textures of the fabric, jewelry, and skin.

Thinking process:  
First, analyze the editing instructions word by word:  
- "Transform the figure into a chibi-style decorative resin bust" → implies change in scale, proportion, and form (chibi = stylized, oversized head, simplified body).  
- "Feature an embroidered brown robe with exaggerated patterns" → allows modification of the robe’s design; patterns can be altered or emphasized.  
- "Colorful headdress with vivid stripes" → permits enhancement or intensification of existing colors and patterns on the headscarf.  
- "Accentuate the pomegranate by making it shine with gloss" → allows for visual alteration of the fruit's surface texture (glossy finish), but not removal or replacement.  
- "Use minimalistic facial lines" → indicates simplification of facial features, but does not remove them entirely.  
- "Sitting atop a smooth wooden base" → introduces a new element (wooden base) not present in original; this is allowed as scene/environmental change.  

Allowed Changes List:  
- Proportions and scale of the figure (due to chibi transformation)  
- Facial line complexity (minimalistic style permitted)  
- Pattern exaggeration on the brown robe  
- Color intensity and vibrancy of the headdress stripes  
- Surface glossiness of the pomegranate  
- Addition of a smooth wooden base (new environment element)  
- Overall artistic style (resin bust, decorative, stylized)  

Step 2 – Determine the elements that should remain unchanged  
Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements:  
- The **pomegranate** is a key symbolic object in the original image—its presence, shape, and partial opening are central to the composition. Even if glossy, it must retain its identity as a pomegranate. Its position in the hands is functionally linked to the pose and narrative.  
- The **headscarf’s color scheme and striped pattern**—golden-yellow with purple, blue, and red diagonal stripes—is distinctive and visually dominant. While vividness may increase, the core stripe structure and color palette must remain recognizable.  
- The **ornate earring**—specifically its silver construction with red gemstones and dangling components—is a unique accessory that contributes to cultural and aesthetic identification. It cannot be replaced or removed.  
- The **brown vest with blue embroidery**—the specific placement and design of the blue stitching along the collar and shoulder are part of the garment’s identity. Though patterns may be exaggerated, the base design must remain identifiable.  
- The **position of the hands holding the pomegranate**—this functional relationship between hands and fruit supports the gesture and composition; altering it would disrupt logical coherence.  

Functional/logical association elements:  
- The **hands gripping the pomegranate** maintain a physical action that anchors the subject’s posture. Even in chibi form, the act of holding must be preserved to retain narrative logic.  
- The **wrist bracelet** is a small but consistent detail; while size may scale down, its presence as a silver band must be retained for continuity.  

Non-modified element deduction:  
After excluding allowed changes (proportion, facial lines, gloss, pattern exaggeration), the remaining unmentioned visual features must be preserved for consistency:  
- The **color of the inner robe** (off-white) must remain identifiable despite potential stylization.  
- The **texture and drape of the headscarf**—how it folds and flows from the head—must be retained even if simplified.  
- The **earring’s structure** (silver frame, red stones, dangling parts) must not be abstracted beyond recognition.  

Preservation Targets List:  
- The pomegranate (shape, partially opened state, red color)  
- The golden-yellow headscarf with diagonal purple, blue, and red stripes  
- The ornate silver earring with red gemstones and dangling elements  
- The brown vest with blue embroidered collar and shoulder details  
- The hands holding the pomegranate (functional grip)  
- The silver bracelet on the right wrist  
- The off-white inner robe  
- The positioning of the headscarf draping over the shoulders and back  

Q1:  
Thinking process: The pomegranate is a core symbolic and compositional element in the original painting. Its distinct shape—round, red exterior with visible internal seeds—and partially opened state are essential to its identity. Even with added gloss, the fruit must remain recognizable as a pomegranate. This is a key identifier of the subject’s interaction and thematic content, and losing it would fundamentally alter the image’s meaning. Thus, it is assigned 3 points.  
Question: Is the pomegranate present and clearly identifiable as a red, round fruit with visible internal seeds, held in the hands?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The headscarf’s color and pattern—golden-yellow with diagonal stripes in purple, blue, and red—are iconic visual features that define the subject’s appearance. These stripes are not arbitrary; they contribute to the cultural and aesthetic identity of the figure. Although the instruction allows for vividness and enhancement, the basic color scheme and striped structure must remain intact for recognition. Loss of these would make the figure unrecognizable. Therefore, this is a high-weight element.  
Question: Does the headscarf retain its golden-yellow base color with diagonal stripes in purple, blue, and red?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The ornate earring is a unique accessory with specific components: silver framework, red gemstone, and dangling elements. Its presence contributes to the subject’s cultural and decorative identity. Even in a stylized version, the earring’s structure must remain identifiable. Removing or altering it significantly would break the visual continuity. Hence, it is critical and assigned 3 points.  
Question: Is the left ear adorned with a silver earring featuring a red gemstone and dangling components?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The brown vest with blue embroidery along the collar and shoulder is a key clothing detail that distinguishes the subject’s attire. The blue stitching is not random—it follows a specific pattern that adds visual interest and cultural context. While patterns may be exaggerated, the base design must remain recognizable. This is an important identifying feature, thus assigned 2 points.  
Question: Does the brown outer vest have blue embroidered detailing along the collar and shoulder seams?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The hands holding the pomegranate represent a functional and compositional anchor. The grip is natural and deliberate, connecting the figure to the symbolic fruit. In any transformation, the act of holding must be preserved to maintain narrative logic. Even in chibi form, the hands must be shown grasping the fruit. This is a crucial action-based element, so it receives 2 points.  
Question: Are both hands visibly positioned around the pomegranate, showing a clear grip?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The silver bracelet on the right wrist is a minor but consistent detail that adds to the subject’s adornment. While it may shrink in scale due to chibi proportions, its presence as a metallic band must be retained. Its absence would be a noticeable omission in detail fidelity. It is a secondary but coherent element, hence assigned 1 point.  
Question: Is there a silver-colored bracelet visible on the right wrist?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The inner robe’s off-white color is a foundational element of the attire. While texture may be simplified, the base color must remain distinguishable to preserve the clothing hierarchy and contrast with the darker vest. This is a detail-level element that supports visual coherence, so it receives 1 point.  
Question: Is the inner garment under the vest primarily off-white in color?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1
