      "thinking_process": "The feathered plume atop the knight’s helmet is a highly distinctive and non-replaceable visual trait. Its curved, upward-sweeping shape and contrast with the metallic helmet make it a core identification feature. In any transformation, even into chibi form, retaining this plume ensures the knight remains recognizable as the original character. Loss of this feature would result in misidentification.",
      "question": "Is the feathered plume still present on top of the knight's helmet?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The rampant lion emblem on the shield is a central heraldic symbol and one of the most identifiable features of the original image. It is intricately designed with specific posture (upright, front paws raised) and metallic finish. This detail is crucial for maintaining the knight’s identity and narrative significance. Removing or altering it would undermine the thematic consistency.",
      "question": "Is the rampant lion emblem clearly visible on the shield?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The spear held in the knight’s right hand is a functional object tied directly to the knight’s pose and role. Its diagonal placement across the body contributes to the composition and balance. While the chibi version may simplify it, the presence and orientation of the spear must be preserved to retain the original action and intent.",
      "question": "Is the knight holding a long spear or lance in their right hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The knight’s armor includes distinct components such as articulated pauldrons and greaves, which define the character’s appearance. These structural elements distinguish the knight from generic fantasy figures. Even in stylized form, these parts must be recognizable to preserve authenticity.",
      "question": "Are the knight's pauldrons and greaves visibly present in the armor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The castle’s turret with its conical roof and flagpole is a defining architectural feature of the background. It provides contextual depth and historical authenticity. Though scaled down in the diorama, its shape and placement must remain intact to maintain scene recognition.",
      "question": "Is the castle's main turret with a conical roof and flagpole still visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The ivy hanging from the archway adds organic texture and environmental detail to the scene. It enhances realism and ties the natural world to the stone structure. While not central to the knight’s identity, its presence contributes to visual coherence and should be preserved in the diorama setting.",
      "question": "Are strands of ivy hanging down from the top of the archway?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The knight’s stance—facing right with shield on the left and spear on the right—is critical for maintaining the original composition and narrative direction. This posture establishes spatial logic and focus. Any deviation would disrupt the intended visual flow.",
      "question": "Is the knight positioned facing toward the right side of the image, with the shield on the left arm?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
