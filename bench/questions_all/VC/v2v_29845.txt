Description of reference image: The subject consists of two distinct figures: a man and a Highland cow. The man is positioned on the left side of the frame, wearing a white lab coat over a dark shirt and tie, paired with brown trousers and black dress shoes. He holds a thick, braided white rope in his right hand, which is looped around the cow’s muzzle. His posture is upright and forward-facing, suggesting he is walking alongside the animal. The Highland cow, located to the right of the man, has long, curved horns that sweep upward and outward from its head, a dense reddish-brown shaggy coat, and a prominent hump on its shoulders. Its face is partially obscured by the rope halter, but its eyes are visible and directed forward. The cow's legs are sturdy, with dark hooves, and it appears mid-stride on a green grassy field. In the background, there is a blurred crowd of spectators behind a metal railing, indicating an outdoor event such as a livestock show. A white tent structure is visible in the upper right corner, and trees form a soft green backdrop beyond the crowd. The lighting is natural daylight, evenly illuminating both subjects.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions: "Blend the man and the cow into a single humanoid figure, combining features like the horns and fur of the cow with the clothing and posture of the man." This explicitly allows for transformation of the **form** of both the man and the cow into a hybrid entity. The instruction specifies merging **features**—specifically the **horns and fur of the cow** and the **clothing and posture of the man**—indicating these elements are to be **retained and integrated**, not discarded. However, the **overall identity** of each original subject (man and cow) is to be altered into a new composite being. Therefore, changes are permitted to:
- The physical separation between man and cow
- The anatomical structure of both figures
- The spatial relationship between them

But since the instruction mandates **combining** certain features, those features must still exist in some form in the final image. Thus, while the **individual identities** of the man and cow are no longer preserved, their **key visual attributes** are to be retained and fused.

Allowed Changes List:
- The separation between the man and the cow (they are to be merged)
- The anatomical boundaries of the human and animal bodies
- The positioning of limbs and torso if reconfigured into a hybrid form
- The overall silhouette and proportion of the combined figure
- The background environment (not specified to be preserved)

Step 2- Determine the elements that should remain unchanged  
Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements: Although the man and cow are to be blended, the instruction specifies that **the horns and fur of the cow** and **the clothing and posture of the man** must be incorporated. These are not arbitrary additions—they are **explicitly named features** to be preserved in the transformation. Therefore, they constitute the core identity of the edited result. The **horns** are iconic to the Highland cow and essential for species identification; their shape and placement must be retained. The **fur texture and color** are defining traits of the breed and contribute to visual authenticity. Similarly, the **white lab coat**, **dark tie**, and **brown trousers** are distinctive elements of the man’s attire and must be preserved in the hybrid form. The **posture**—walking forward with one leg slightly raised—must also be maintained to preserve the dynamic action of the scene.

Functional/logical association elements: The **rope halter** connects the man and cow in the original image and serves a functional role in guiding the animal. While the instruction does not mention preserving the rope, it is part of the interaction between the two subjects. Since the man’s posture and the cow’s movement are linked via this rope, and the instruction involves combining their forms, the **presence and function** of the rope may be implied in the fusion. However, since the rope is not explicitly mentioned in the instruction as a feature to retain, and the blending may alter or eliminate it, it is not required to be preserved unless it contributes directly to the integration of posture or clothing. Given that the instruction focuses on **features**, not tools, the rope is not a mandatory retention element.

Non modified element deduction: After excluding allowed changes (merging, restructuring), the remaining elements that must be preserved are those **explicitly referenced** in the instruction: the **cow’s horns**, **fur**, and the **man’s clothing and posture**. These are not just details—they are the **building blocks** of the new hybrid figure. Any other unmentioned aspects (e.g., facial features of the man, exact color of the tie, specific brand of shoes) are not required to be preserved unless they are integral to the clothing or posture.

Preservation Targets List:  
- The presence and shape of the cow’s long, curved horns  
- The reddish-brown shaggy fur texture of the cow  
- The white lab coat worn by the man  
- The dark tie under the lab coat  
- The brown trousers and black dress shoes of the man  
- The forward walking posture with one leg lifted  

Q1:  
Thinking process: The long, curved horns are a defining characteristic of the Highland cow and are explicitly mentioned in the instruction as a feature to be combined into the new figure. Their unique upward-sweeping shape and position on the head are critical for identifying the animal origin of the hybrid. If these horns are absent or significantly altered in shape, the cow’s identity is lost, undermining the intent of the edit. Therefore, this is a core identity element with a weight of 3 points.  
Question: Are the long, upward-curving horns of the cow present and retaining their original shape and position on the head?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The reddish-brown shaggy fur is a key visual identifier of the Highland cow and is specifically mentioned in the instruction as a feature to be included. The texture and color are essential for distinguishing this breed from others and contribute to the realism of the hybrid. Losing this fur would remove a major component of the cow’s identity. Thus, it is a core element with a weight of 3 points.  
Question: Is the reddish-brown shaggy fur covering the body of the hybrid figure, particularly on the head and shoulders, present and consistent with the original cow’s appearance?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The white lab coat is a distinctive piece of clothing worn by the man and is explicitly referenced in the instruction as a feature to be retained in the hybrid. It is a key identifier of the man’s role and appearance. Its presence and color are essential for maintaining the human aspect of the fusion. Altering or removing it would break the continuity of the man’s identity. Hence, it is a core element with a weight of 3 points.  
Question: Is the white lab coat visible on the upper body of the hybrid figure, including the lapels, pockets, and full length down to the waist?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The dark tie under the lab coat is a specific detail of the man’s attire and contributes to the formal appearance of the figure. While less central than the coat, it is part of the clothing ensemble that must be preserved according to the instruction. Its presence helps maintain the integrity of the man’s original look. It is an important accessory, so it carries a weight of 2 points.  
Question: Is the dark-colored tie visible beneath the collar of the lab coat on the hybrid figure?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The brown trousers and black dress shoes are part of the man’s lower-body attire and are essential for completing the human form. The instruction mentions preserving the man’s posture, which includes the stance and leg movement. The trousers and shoes are necessary to support this posture visually. Their absence would disrupt the coherence of the human element. They are important but not as central as the coat or horns, so they carry a weight of 2 points.  
Question: Are the brown trousers and black dress shoes present on the lower half of the hybrid figure, with the right leg slightly raised in a walking motion?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The forward walking posture with one leg lifted is a dynamic element of the original image and is explicitly tied to the man’s movement. The instruction requires preserving the man’s posture, meaning the gait and balance must be maintained in the hybrid. This posture is crucial for conveying motion and continuity. It is a key functional element, so it carries a weight of 3 points.  
Question: Does the hybrid figure exhibit a forward walking posture with the right leg lifted off the ground, mimicking the original man’s stride?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3
