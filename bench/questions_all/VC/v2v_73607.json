It is a core identity feature of the original image, and its absence would make the transformation lose its connection to the source. Since the instruction allows reimagining the attire but not removing the leopard motif, this graphic must be preserved in some form (e.g., as a decorative motif on the royal linen). Its presence is essential for visual continuity and recognition.",

Although they are to be transformed into symbolic gilded offerings, the instruction implies their retention in symbolic form. Therefore, the **gold color** and **gloved hands** must be preserved, even if stylized. Losing them would remove a key functional and aesthetic element.",

While the instruction allows changing the material to royal linen, it specifies that the leopard motifs should remain. Therefore, the **pattern itself** — the distribution of black and brown spots on a light background — must be preserved in the new design. This is a core visual identity element.",
