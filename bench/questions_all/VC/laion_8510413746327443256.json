      "thinking_process": "The rectangular display with rounded corners is the core visual identifier of the Apple Watch series. This shape is universally recognized as part of the product’s design language and differentiates it from round or oval smartwatches. If this shape is lost, the device would no longer be identifiable as an Apple Watch, even if reimagined as a dragon. Therefore, it is a key identity-preserving element.",
      "question": "Is the display of the device rectangular with rounded corners?",

      "thinking_process": "The digital crown is a signature feature of Apple Watch, located on the right side of the case. Its placement is critical for user interaction and brand recognition. Although the instruction says it becomes a \"glowing neural node,\" its physical location must remain unchanged to preserve functional logic and visual consistency.",
      "question": "Is the digital crown positioned on the right side of the watch case?",

      "thinking_process": "The side button below the digital crown is a functional component of the Apple Watch, used for system navigation. Though not explicitly mentioned in the editing instruction, it is a standard hardware feature and must remain in place to maintain device functionality and structural integrity. Its absence would compromise the device’s usability and recognizability.",
      "question": "Is there a small button located below the digital crown on the right side of the case?",

      "thinking_process": "The band connects to the case at both ends, forming a closed loop around the wrist. This structural relationship is essential for wearability. Even if the band is transformed into silver scales, the attachment points must remain at the same positions on the case to maintain ergonomic and functional coherence.",
      "question": "Are the ends of the band attached to the left and right sides of the watch case?",

      "thinking_process": "The screen is oriented directly forward, facing outward from the wrist, which is necessary for visibility and interaction. Even when transformed into a holographic dragon eye, the screen must retain its front-facing orientation to serve its purpose. A change in angle would disrupt usability and break the logical continuity of the device.",
      "question": "Is the screen facing directly forward, perpendicular to the wrist?",

      "thinking_process": "The overall thickness and depth of the case are implied by the shadow and curvature in the original image. This compact profile is characteristic of the Apple Watch design. Even in a cybernetic transformation, maintaining similar depth ensures the device remains plausible as a wearable and avoids disproportionate scaling.",
      "question": "Does the watch case have a slim, compact profile with minimal depth?",

      "thinking_process": "The band is made of a flexible, seamless material with a matte finish, and it features multiple adjustment holes along its length. While the material and color will change, the structural presence of these holes indicates adjustability, a functional requirement. Their retention ensures the band remains usable and recognizable as a wrist strap.",
