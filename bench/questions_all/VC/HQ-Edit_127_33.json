      "thinking_process": "The central fountain is the most prominent architectural feature in the image, serving as the focal point of the entire garden. Its position directly in the center of the radial design is essential for maintaining the garden’s symmetry and visual hierarchy. Even if transformed into a mystical spring, its **location at the exact center** must remain unchanged to preserve the garden’s compositional integrity. Losing this would disrupt the entire spatial logic of the scene. This is a core identity element, hence weighted 3 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The radial symmetry of the garden is a defining characteristic of formal English gardens. The hedges, flowerbeds, and pathways radiate outward from the fountain, forming a precise geometric pattern. Even if the pathways become spiraling vines, the **underlying radial structure** must be preserved to maintain the garden’s identity. Disrupting this symmetry would fundamentally alter the garden’s essence. This is a key structural element, so it receives 3 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The archway gate at the end of the central path is a critical compositional element that provides depth and perspective. It connects the garden to the distant village, grounding the scene in a realistic setting. Although the path may transform into a spiral vine, the **gate’s position at the terminus of the central axis** must remain to preserve the visual narrative. Removing or relocating it would break the scene’s logical progression. This is a key functional element, thus weighted 3 points.",

Their **architectural outlines and placement behind the garden wall** are essential for establishing the scene’s geographic and cultural context. Even if the garden becomes ethereal, these structures must remain recognizable to preserve the original setting. This is a key environmental identifier, so it is weighted 2 points.",

Their **presence in the lower front portion of the image**, near the viewer’s eye level, is crucial for establishing color harmony and visual interest. Even if magical elements are added, the **existence and positioning of these specific pink roses** must remain to maintain continuity with the original flora.

Its **placement in concentric rings around the fountain** is a deliberate design choice. Even if the fountain glows or water becomes crystalline, the **presence of lavender in that specific ringed formation** must be retained to preserve the original planting plan.

While they may be transformed into sentient beings, their **original cylindrical, upright shape** must be preserved as a foundation. This ensures continuity between the original and edited versions.
