      "thinking_process": "The orb-web is the defining structural feature of this spider species and the core functional element of the scene. Its radial symmetry and concentric circles are unique identifiers of an orb-weaver spider’s web. If this pattern is lost or distorted, the image loses its biological and ecological authenticity, even if the spider is mythologized. The web’s geometry is not mentioned for alteration, so it must be preserved. This is a 3-point element because it is both functionally critical and visually iconic.",
      "question": "Is the circular orb-web with clearly defined radial and concentric threads still present and structurally intact?",

      "thinking_process": "The arrangement of branches forming an arch around the web creates a natural frame and establishes the spatial context. This layout is essential for depth and composition. Since no instruction specifies changing the branch structure, it must be retained. Altering the branch angles or positions would disrupt the balance and narrative of the scene. This is a 2-point element due to its importance in scene logic and framing.",
      "question": "Are the branches positioned in a natural arc around the web, supporting it from multiple directions?",

      "thinking_process": "The oval-shaped leaves with visible veins and slight glossiness are distinctive botanical features that contribute to the realism of the environment. Their shape and texture help identify the plant species and provide visual detail. These are not mentioned for modification, so they must remain. Losing these details would make the foliage appear generic or inconsistent. This is a 2-point element due to its role in environmental specificity.",
      "question": "Do the leaves retain their oval shape, visible venation, and glossy surface texture?",

      "thinking_process": "Water droplets on the leaves add micro-detail and suggest recent moisture or dew, enhancing realism. While small, they are consistent across the original image and contribute to atmospheric coherence. Since the editing does not mention altering weather or surface conditions, these droplets should be preserved. Their absence would reduce visual fidelity. This is a 1-point element as it is a minor detail but contributes to overall consistency.",

It supports the outdoor setting without distracting from the subject. Since the instruction does not specify changing the background, it must remain. Altering the sky tone or adding elements like clouds would shift the mood unnaturally. This is a 2-point element due to its role in setting the scene’s atmosphere.",
      "question": "Is the background a soft, uniform pale blue-gray sky without additional elements such as clouds or sun?",

The threads connect precisely to the branch ends, ensuring the web appears anchored realistically. If these connection points are missing or misaligned, the web would seem floating or unstable. This is a 2-point element due to its functional and compositional importance.",
