### Step 1: Description of Reference Image and Allowed Changes List

**Description of Reference Image:**  
The image features three keychains with potato-like characters in different scenarios. Each keychain has a metallic ring and chain. The first keychain shows a potato character wearing a green headband and holding dumbbells, suggesting exercise. The second keychain depicts a potato character sleeping inside a cardboard box. The third keychain portrays a potato character sitting at a table, eating food. The background is plain white with some dried plant stems above the keychains.

**Thinking Process:**  
The editing instructions specify transforming the keychain designs into dynamic comic book panels while retaining their core identities. The scene and background can be altered to fit a comic book style, including bold outlines and vibrant colors. However, the core activities and identities of the potato characters must be preserved.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
1. The background can be changed to a comic book-style setting.
2. The potato characters can be repositioned dynamically within the new scenes.
3. The color palette can be adjusted to vibrant flat colors.
4. Bold ink outlines can be added to the characters and scenes.

### Step 2: Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged

**Thinking Process:**  
Core recognition elements include the potato-like appearance of the characters, their specific activities (exercising, sleeping, eating), and the objects associated with these activities (dumbbells, cardboard box, table with food). Functional/logical elements, such as the dumbbells in the hands of the exercising potato, must be retained to maintain the action's logic. Remaining elements like the metallic rings and chains of the keychains are not crucial for the comic transformation and can be omitted.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
1. Potato-like appearance of the characters.
2. Specific activities (exercising, sleeping, eating).
3. Associated objects (dumbbells, cardboard box, table with food).

### Step 3: Generate Question Answer Pairs

**Q1:**  
Thinking process: The potato-like appearance is a core recognition feature. Losing this would make the characters unidentifiable.  
Question: Do the characters retain their potato-like shape and texture?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3

**Q2:**  
Thinking process: The green headband and dumbbells are essential for recognizing the exercising activity.  
Question: Is the potato character in the first panel still depicted as exercising with dumbbells and wearing a green headband?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3

**Q3:**  
Thinking process: The cardboard box is a key element indicating the sleeping activity.  
Question: Does the potato character in the second panel remain inside a cardboard box, indicating sleep?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2

**Q4:**  
Thinking process: The table with food is necessary to depict the eating activity.  
Question: Is the potato character in the third panel still seated at a table with food items, indicating eating?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2

**Q5:**  
Thinking process: The overall activities are crucial for maintaining the narrative of the comic.  
Question: Are all three panels distinctly showing the activities of exercising, sleeping, and eating respectively?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3

These questions ensure that the core identity, activities, and associated objects of the potato characters are retained in the edited comic book panels.
