      "thinking_process": "The **pointe shoes** are the most definitive functional and symbolic element identifying the subject as a ballerina. They are not just footwear but an iconic part of ballet performance. Their presence and correct form (toes pointed, ribbons wrapped) are essential for recognition. If removed or replaced with regular shoes, the character would no longer be identifiable as a ballerina. Therefore, this is a core identity element with a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Are the pointe shoes visible and correctly positioned on the ballerina’s feet, with ribbons wrapped around the ankles?",

      "thinking_process": "The **tutu** is the signature garment of classical ballet. While its size can be exaggerated per instructions, its **basic structure** — a layered, flared skirt attached to a fitted bodice — must remain intact. Without this silhouette, the costume would lose its balletic identity. Thus, the tutu’s form is a core recognition feature, making it a 3-point element.",

      "thinking_process": "The **hair bun** is a standard requirement in classical ballet performances, especially for young dancers. It signifies discipline and professionalism. The specific detail of a **tight bun with bangs** is distinctive in this image and contributes to the subject’s identity. Altering or removing it would make the dancer appear unrecognizable in context. This is a key visual identifier, hence a 2-point element.",
      "question": "Does the ballerina have her hair styled in a tight bun at the back of her head with straight bangs across her forehead?",

      "thinking_process": "The **ballet pose** — specifically en pointe with one leg forward and arms in fifth position — defines the action and intent of the image. Changing this would transform the dance move and break the narrative of performance. Even in cartoon style, the pose must retain its structural essence. This is a functional and logical element critical to the scene’s coherence. Weight: 3.",
      "question": "Is the ballerina standing en pointe with one leg slightly behind and bent, and the other leg supporting her weight in a balanced position?",

      "thinking_process": "The **wooden floor** serves as the stage environment and provides spatial grounding. It is a real-world detail that anchors the performance. Although the background can be changed, the floor remains a necessary environmental element to maintain realism and logical consistency. Its texture and horizontal planks are distinct and should be preserved unless explicitly overridden. This is a secondary but important scene element. Weight: 2.",
      "question": "Is the ballerina standing on a wooden floor composed of horizontal planks with visible grain and warm brown tones?",

      "thinking_process": "The **facial orientation** — looking upward and to the right — is part of the emotional expression and choreographic intention. It aligns with the arm movement and creates a sense of aspiration. While facial features might be simplified in cartoon style, the direction of gaze must remain consistent to preserve the dynamic of the pose. This is a minor but coherent detail affecting overall balance. Weight: 1.",

      "thinking_process": "The **color of the tutu** — primarily pink — is a key visual attribute in the original image. While soft pastel shades may be added, the base pink hue is central to the costume’s identity. A drastic shift in color (e.g., to blue or yellow) would misrepresent the original. Though the instruction allows pastel tones, the original pink should remain dominant. This is a detail-level element influencing visual consistency. Weight: 1.",
