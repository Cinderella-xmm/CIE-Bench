Description of reference image: The subject is a cross-sectional view of a sandwich made with two slices of whole wheat bread, visibly textured with a golden-brown crust and a porous interior. The sandwich contains green lettuce leaves and a red tomato slice visible at the bottom edge. A maroon ribbon banner is wrapped horizontally across the center of the sandwich, bearing the text "Better" in white cursive script. Above the ribbon, the word "AMERICA'S" is written in bold, brown serif font, and below it, "SANDWICH™" appears in matching brown serif font with a trademark symbol. The entire composition is centered on a plain white background, with no additional environmental elements or characters present.

Thinking process:  
The editing instruction explicitly transforms the sandwich into an anthropomorphized knight character and introduces a new narrative structure ("The Saga of the Heroic Bread Warrior"), including a timeline, hand-drawn illustrations, comic-style text, and dynamic icons. This indicates that the **form, posture, and overall layout** of the original sandwich are to be altered significantly. However, the instruction does not specify changing the **core visual identity elements** such as the **bread texture**, **lettuce**, **tomato**, or **text labels**—these may still serve as foundational components in the new design. The instruction allows for transformation but does not mandate removal of these elements, suggesting they could be retained in modified form. Therefore, changes allowed include:
- Transformation of the sandwich into a knight figure
- Addition of anthropomorphic features (arms, legs, face)
- Introduction of a whimsical story layout with timeline, icons, and illustrations
- Use of vibrant colors and comic-style typography
- Alteration of the scene from static product display to dynamic infographic

Allowed Changes List:  
(Specific element 1 that allows for changes): The shape and form of the sandwich (e.g., turning it into a knight figure)  
(Specific element 2 that allows for changes): The presence and style of the ribbon banner (can be redesigned or replaced)  
(Specific element 3 that allows for changes): The text content and font style (e.g., replacing “America’s Better Sandwich” with narrative titles)  
(Specific element 4 that allows for changes): The background and layout (from simple white background to landscape infographic with timeline and icons)  
(Specific element 5 that allows for changes): The inclusion of new illustrative elements (hand-drawn scenes, circular action icons)  
(Specific element 6 that allows for changes): The color scheme (vibrant, contrasting colors encouraged)

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements: The original image is identifiable as a specific branded sandwich product due to its unique combination of **whole wheat bread texture**, **visible lettuce and tomato fillings**, and **distinct text labeling** (“AMERICA’S”, “Better”, “SANDWICH™”). These elements are essential for brand recognition. Even if stylized, the **texture of the bread**, **presence of lettuce and tomato**, and **original text** must be preserved in some form to maintain continuity with the source image. The **trademark symbol (™)** is also a legal and branding identifier that should remain unless explicitly removed.  

Functional/logical association elements: The **layered structure** of the sandwich (top bread → filling → bottom bread) is logically consistent with real-world sandwiches. If the anthropomorphic knight retains this layering (e.g., bread armor), the functional logic of the sandwich being built from those ingredients should be maintained. The **position of the tomato and lettuce** relative to the bread slices is part of the logical construction of the sandwich and contributes to its realism.  

Non-modified element deduction: After excluding the allowed changes (shape, text, background, layout), the remaining unmentioned visual details—such as the **specific grain pattern of the bread**, **color and shape of the tomato slice**, **green color and leafy structure of the lettuce**, and **exact placement of the text**—must be preserved to retain fidelity to the original. Although the instruction allows transformation, it does not permit arbitrary replacement of core ingredients or textures. For example, while the sandwich can become a knight, it cannot become a burger or hot dog without losing identity.  

Preservation Targets List:  
(The texture of the whole wheat bread slices)  
(The presence and green color of the lettuce leaves)  
(The presence and red color of the tomato slice)  
(The exact text “AMERICA’S” in brown serif font above the ribbon)  
(The exact text “SANDWICH™” in brown serif font below the ribbon)  
(The presence of the maroon ribbon banner across the center)  
(The trademark symbol ™ next to “SANDWICH”)

    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The texture of the whole wheat bread is a core identification feature of the original sandwich. It distinguishes it from white bread or other types and is essential for brand recognition. Even if the sandwich is transformed into a knight, the bread's grainy, porous surface should be preserved in the armor-like design to maintain visual continuity. Loss of this texture would make the original sandwich unrecognizable, hence it is a key element with a weight of 3 points.
    Question: Does the edited image retain the grainy, porous texture of the whole wheat bread slices?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The green lettuce leaves are a defining ingredient in the sandwich and contribute to its visual identity. Their presence and green color are essential for identifying the sandwich as a fresh, vegetable-filled product. Even in an anthropomorphic version, the lettuce should appear as part of the costume (e.g., cape) or filling to preserve the original content. Removing or altering the color would misrepresent the original sandwich, making it a significant retention point with a weight of 3.
    Question: Is the green color and leafy shape of the lettuce leaves preserved in the edited image?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The red tomato slice is a key component of the sandwich’s filling and provides contrast in both color and shape. Its presence at the bottom of the sandwich is a distinctive detail that helps identify the product. In the transformed image, even if stylized, the tomato should remain red and slice-shaped to maintain consistency with the original. Its absence or color change would break the visual link to the source image, thus warranting a weight of 3.
    Question: Is the red tomato slice visible and intact in the edited image?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The text “AMERICA’S” in brown serif font is a core branding element positioned above the ribbon. It is part of the official name and must be preserved to maintain brand identity. While the instruction allows for narrative text, it does not state that this original label should be removed. Any deviation in font, color, or position would undermine the original’s identity, so this is a high-priority retention element with a weight of 3.
    Question: Is the text “AMERICA’S” displayed in brown serif font above the ribbon in the edited image?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The maroon ribbon banner is a distinctive design feature that wraps around the sandwich and holds the word “Better.” Its color and placement are integral to the logo’s visual balance and branding. Even if the banner is reimagined as part of the knight’s attire, its maroon color and central horizontal position should be preserved. Losing this element would remove a key visual anchor, reducing coherence, so it is assigned a weight of 2.
    Question: Is the maroon ribbon banner present across the center of the sandwich in the edited image?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The trademark symbol ™ next to “SANDWICH” is a legal and branding identifier. Its presence confirms the proprietary nature of the product. Although minor, its omission could lead to misrepresentation or loss of brand authenticity. Since it is part of the original text, it should be retained unless explicitly stated otherwise. Thus, it is a detail-level element with a weight of 2.
    Question: Is the trademark symbol (™) present next to the word “SANDWICH” in the edited image?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The text “SANDWICH™” in brown serif font below the ribbon is another core branding component. It completes the product name and must be preserved for identity. While the instruction allows for narrative text, it does not require replacing this label. Changing its font, color, or position would disrupt brand recognition, so it is a critical retention element with a weight of 3.
    Question: Is the text “SANDWICH™” displayed in brown serif font below the ribbon in the edited image?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
