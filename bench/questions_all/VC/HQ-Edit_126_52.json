Even when transformed into a mythical creature, losing the sphere would fundamentally alter the subject’s identity. Therefore, preserving the spherical form is critical for recognition and continuity.",

      "thinking_process": "The vertical ribbing is a signature morphological trait of barrel cacti. It provides structural definition and visual rhythm. Removing or distorting it would make the object unrecognizable as derived from the original species. Even if augmented with glyphs or eyes, the ribbed structure must remain intact as a foundational element.",
      "question": "Are the vertical ribs of the cactus clearly visible and maintaining their segmented pattern?",

      "thinking_process": "The green color of the cactus body is essential for botanical identification. While luminous glyphs may be added, the underlying green must persist to ensure the transformed creature still visually connects to the original plant. A complete shift to another color would sever that link.",

Changing it to a tilted or floating form would disrupt the sense of balance and reality-based composition.",

      "thinking_process": "The wooden surface beneath the pot provides environmental context and texture contrast. While the material may be altered (e.g., to stone), the presence of a textured, aged, flat surface is necessary to anchor the scene and maintain visual coherence. Its absence would remove a key grounding element.",

      "thinking_process": "The relationship between the cactus and its base is functional — the plant sits upon a support. Even if the pot becomes a pedestal, the hierarchical arrangement (object on base) must be preserved to maintain logical spatial structure. Reversing or eliminating this would break compositional logic.",
      "question": "Is the cactus placed directly above a supporting structure (such as a pedestal or pot)?",
