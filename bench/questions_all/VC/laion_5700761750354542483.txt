**Step 1 – Analyze the Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a jeweled butterfly ornament, crafted in a golden metallic finish with intricate detailing. The butterfly has two large upper wings and two smaller lower wings, all symmetrically shaped with curved edges and pointed tips. The wings are densely adorned with gemstones: clear, pale yellow, and deep blue rhinestones arranged in patterns resembling natural wing markings. Larger marquise-cut clear stones form diagonal stripes across each upper wing, while round blue and dark gray stones cluster along veins and central zones. The body of the butterfly is slender and gold, with two small black bead-like eyes at the head. A thin gold wire loop extends from the top of the head, indicating it is designed as a hanging ornament. The butterfly rests on a green pine branch with needle-like foliage, set against a solid black background. The lighting highlights the sparkle of the gems and the reflective surface of the gold metal.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction explicitly states:  
- *"Transform the jeweled butterfly into a plush toy using soft fabrics."* → This indicates the **material and form** of the subject can be changed entirely.  
- *"Replace the gemstone details with embroidered patterns in vibrant blues and golds."* → The **gemstone decoration** is to be replaced; thus, the **presence of actual gemstones** is no longer required.  
- *"Use velvety material for the wings and add fluffy texture along the edges."* → Material texture and surface quality of the wings are allowed to change.  
- *"Maintain the butterfly shape"* → The **overall silhouette and structure** (i.e., four wings, body, antennae-like loop) must remain unchanged.  
- *"Position it atop a plain pearl-white cushion to highlight its ornamental appeal."* → The **background scene** (original pine branch and black backdrop) is to be replaced with a new one (pearl-white cushion). Therefore, the original **environmental elements** are not required to be preserved.

From this, we can deduce:

**Allowed Changes List:**  
- Material of the butterfly: from metallic/gemstone to soft fabric/plush  
- Surface texture: from hard, reflective, gem-studded to soft, velvety, fluffy  
- Decorative elements: gemstones replaced with embroidered patterns  
- Color scheme: gemstone colors may be reinterpreted via embroidery (but "vibrant blues and golds" suggests color palette retention)  
- Background/environment: pine branch and black background → replaced by pearl-white cushion  
- Functional element: the hanging loop may be retained or adapted (not specified), but since it’s part of the ornament's function, it might be implied to persist in some form  

However, **the butterfly’s shape, proportions, and structural layout** are explicitly stated to be maintained — hence these **must remain**.

---

**Step 2 – Determine the Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
We now identify what **cannot be changed**, based on exclusion from the allowed changes list and core identity logic.

**Core recognition elements:**  
The butterfly’s **distinctive four-winged shape** is essential. Even though it becomes a plush toy, the **silhouette must match the original**: two large upper wings and two smaller lower wings, symmetrically arranged, with characteristic curves and pointed tips. If the shape were altered (e.g., rounded wings, fewer wings), it would no longer be recognizable as the same butterfly design. This is critical for identity preservation.

Additionally, the **relative positioning of wings and body** defines the spatial structure. The **loop at the top of the head** (used for hanging) is a functional feature that may be preserved even in a plush version, as it supports the “ornamental” purpose. While not strictly necessary if the plush is displayed differently, the instruction implies maintaining the object’s decorative intent, so the **presence of a hanging mechanism** should logically be retained.

**Functional/logical association elements:**  
The **butterfly’s orientation and posture** — resting flat with wings spread — is implied in both original and edited versions. The instruction says “position it atop a cushion,” which preserves the **horizontal, open-winged pose**, so this **spatial arrangement must remain**.

**Non-modified element deduction:**  
Although the materials and decorations are replaced, certain **structural features** are not mentioned as changeable and are necessary for visual consistency:
- The **division of wings into upper and lower pairs**
- The **central body connecting the wings**
- The **presence of a head with eye-like features** (even if simplified)
- The **symmetrical layout** of the wings

These are not directly addressed in the instructions as changeable, and altering them would break the core identity of the butterfly.

Even though the **gemstone patterns** are replaced, their **arrangement and distribution** (e.g., diagonal stripes, clustered centers) may inform the **embroidery pattern**, suggesting that the **visual motif** (not the material) should be preserved. However, since the instruction specifies replacement with embroidery, the **actual gemstones themselves are not required** — only the **design layout**.

But the **original gemstone placement** is not explicitly preserved in the instruction, so it is **allowed to be modified**. Thus, **only the shape and structure** are mandatory.

Final deduction:  
Only **form, proportion, symmetry, and key structural components** (wings, body, loop) must be preserved. All other elements — material, texture, decoration, background — are permitted to change.

---

**Preservation Targets List:**  
- Butterfly shape: four-winged, symmetrical, with upper and lower pairs  
- Relative size and proportion of wings to body  
- Position of the head and hanging loop at the top center  
- Symmetry of the entire figure  
- Open-winged, flat resting posture

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The butterfly's four-winged structure with two large upper wings and two smaller lower wings is its core identifying feature. Changing this would result in a different insect or abstract shape, making it unrecognizable as the original butterfly design. The presence of distinct upper and lower wings with specific proportions is essential for identity, hence this is a 3-point question.
    Question: Does the edited image retain the butterfly’s four-winged structure with two large upper wings and two smaller lower wings?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The symmetrical layout of the wings is a defining characteristic of the original butterfly ornament. Asymmetry would disrupt the visual balance and make it visually inconsistent with the original. Since the instruction requires maintaining the butterfly shape, symmetry must be preserved as a core aspect of that shape.
    Question: Is the butterfly depicted with symmetrical wings on both sides?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The central body connects the wings and houses the head with the hanging loop. This structural component is essential for the butterfly’s anatomical coherence. Even as a plush toy, the body must remain present to maintain the butterfly’s form and functionality as an ornament.
    Question: Is there a visible central body connecting the wings?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The hanging loop at the top of the head is a functional element that defines the object as a hanging ornament. Although the material may change, the instruction implies maintaining its ornamental use, so the loop must remain in position and function. Its absence would alter the object’s intended use.
    Question: Is there a loop or attachment point at the top of the butterfly’s head?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The butterfly is shown in a flat, open-winged posture in the original image. This pose is essential for displaying the full wing design and is consistent with the instruction to place it on a cushion for display. Altering the pose (e.g., folded wings) would contradict the intended presentation and reduce visual fidelity.
    Question: Is the butterfly positioned with wings fully spread in a flat, horizontal orientation?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The relative proportions of the wings to the body define the butterfly’s aesthetic balance. Enlarging or shrinking any part disproportionately would distort the original design. While the instruction allows material change, proportion is tied to shape preservation, so it must remain consistent.
    Question: Are the wings proportionally larger than the body, matching the original scale?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The upper wings have a distinct pointed tip and curved edge, forming a signature silhouette. This shape is unique to the butterfly’s design and distinguishes it from other insects. Losing this contour would make the butterfly unrecognizable.
    Question: Do the upper wings have a pointed tip and curved outer edge?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q8: 
    Thinking process: The lower wings are smaller and rounded compared to the upper ones, contributing to the overall balance. This distinction in wing size is a minor but identifiable detail that helps confirm the butterfly’s correct morphology. It is not core but important for visual accuracy.
    Question: Are the lower wings visibly smaller and more rounded than the upper wings?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
