    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "The book is the central functional object in the scene, defining the activity (reading). Its presence and being held by the adult are essential to the narrative. Even if glowing or stylized, it must remain an open book in the adult’s hands. Losing this would remove the core action of the image, making it unrecognizable as a reading scene. Therefore, the presence of the book in the adult’s hands is a key identification feature.",
      "question": "Is the adult character holding an open book?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The three children are essential to the composition and context. Their number and grouping define the social dynamic. Changing their count would fundamentally alter the scene’s meaning. Thus, preserving the count of three children is critical for maintaining narrative consistency.",
      "question": "Are there exactly three children in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The blue-and-yellow uniform with hats is a distinctive visual trait shared by all children, identifying them as a group (likely students). Even if stylized or anthropomorphized, the color scheme and hat design must be preserved to retain their collective identity. This is a key detail for recognizing the children as part of a unified group.",
      "question": "Do all three children wear blue uniforms with yellow trim and blue hats with yellow ribbons?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The adult’s position to the left, facing the children, establishes the directional flow of the scene. Reversing or altering this would disrupt the reading interaction. While posture can be exaggerated, the left-side placement and orientation must remain consistent to preserve the scene’s logic.",
      "question": "Is the adult character positioned on the left side of the image, facing the children?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The top child pointing at the book is a key interactive gesture, indicating engagement with the story. This action reinforces the narrative and cannot be omitted without losing the dynamic between reader and audience. It is a specific behavioral detail that must be retained.",
      "question": "Is one of the children pointing toward the book held by the adult?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The seated child’s posture (crossed legs, hands clasped) is a distinct pose that contributes to the composition’s balance and individuality within the group. While minor, it helps identify the specific arrangement of characters and should be preserved for visual consistency.",
      "question": "Is the bottom child seated with legs crossed and hands clasped?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The green background is currently plain and untextured. Since the instruction explicitly replaces it with an enchanted forest, the original background need not be preserved. However, the absence of any other environmental elements (like furniture or walls) means the scene is defined by character placement alone. Thus, the lack of background detail is not a retention requirement.",
      "question": "Is the background a solid green color with no additional elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
