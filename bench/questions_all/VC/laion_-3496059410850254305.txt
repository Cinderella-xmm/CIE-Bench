**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is an acoustic guitar positioned horizontally against a plain white background. The guitar has a natural wood finish with prominent vertical grain patterns, characteristic of koa or similar tonewoods. The body shape is a cutaway dreadnought style, featuring a rounded lower bout, a gently curved upper bout, and a single cutaway on the upper right side (from the viewer’s perspective). The soundhole is circular, surrounded by a simple rosette design, and contains a visible label inside. A black pickguard is located below the soundhole. The bridge is black with six saddle pins and six strings running over it. The fretboard is made of dark wood with dot inlays along the frets. The headstock is angled slightly upward, bearing the "Fender" logo in cursive script on its face. Six silver tuning pegs are arranged three per side. The neck is straight and slender, leading to the headstock. The overall color scheme is warm brown with variations in tone due to the wood grain. There are no additional accessories, lighting effects, or environmental elements—only the guitar and a neutral white backdrop.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction explicitly transforms the guitar into a heroic comic book character named “Strum-Crusader.” This indicates that the **form and function** of the guitar will be reimagined as a **character**, not preserved as a musical instrument. Key changes include:
- **Guitar body → armored torso**: The physical structure of the body is being repurposed as part of a character’s anatomy.
- **Wood grain → metallic mahogany finish**: The texture is altered from organic wood to a stylized metallic appearance.
- **Strings → muscle strands**: The strings are reinterpreted as biological features.
- **Neck → cape origin point**: The neck becomes a source for a luminous cape.
- **Headstock → emblem location**: The headstock gains a bright emblem.
- **Dynamic illustrative lines added**: Visual style shifts to comic-book aesthetics.

These modifications indicate that the **core identity** of the object is changing—from a real-world guitar to a fictional character—so **any element not specifically referenced in the instructions can be transformed**.

However, the instruction does **not** say to remove or alter certain core visual features; instead, it describes **how** they should be reinterpreted. Therefore, we must determine what parts of the original image are **being reused** in the transformation versus **replaced**.

Allowed Changes List:
- Guitar body shape → transformed into armored torso (allowed to change)
- Wood grain texture → replaced with metallic deep mahogany finish (allowed to change)
- Strings → reimagined as muscle strands (allowed to change)
- Neck → source of cape (allowed to change)
- Headstock → now bears a bright emblem (allowed to change)
- Overall style → shifted to dynamic comic-book illustration (allowed to change)
- Background → implied to be changed (no mention of preservation)
- Pickguard → not mentioned → allowed to change
- Soundhole → not mentioned → allowed to change
- Fretboard → not mentioned → allowed to change
- Tuning pegs → not mentioned → allowed to change

Thus, **all structural and aesthetic components** of the guitar are permitted to be modified unless they are **explicitly required to be retained** in the transformation.

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
We now assess which elements **must be retained**, even after transformation, based on:

1. **Core recognition elements**: These are unique identifiers that anchor the subject's identity. For a guitar, these include:
   - The **overall silhouette** of the guitar body (dreadnought with cutaway), which defines its class.
   - The **presence of six strings**—a functional necessity for a standard acoustic guitar.
   - The **position and number of tuning pegs** (six total, three per side).
   - The **headstock with the Fender logo**—this is a brand-specific identifier and key to recognition.
   - The **bridge and saddle configuration**—six individual saddles imply six strings.
   - The **soundhole**—central feature of acoustic guitars, essential for sound projection.

   Even though the instruction says to transform the guitar into a character, it does **not** state that the **number of strings or tuning pegs should be changed**, nor does it suggest removing the Fender logo. In fact, the headstock is referenced as the location of the **emblem**, implying its **physical presence remains**, just enhanced.

2. **Functional/logical association elements**: 
   - The **string-to-tuning peg connection** must remain logically consistent: each string runs from the bridge to a tuning peg. Even if rendered as muscle strands, there should still be **six distinct strands** connecting the body to the headstock.
   - The **neck must connect the body to the headstock**, maintaining the anatomical continuity of the guitar’s structure, now interpreted as a character’s spine or neck.

3. **Non-modified element deduction**:
   - Since the instruction specifies **"draw a luminous cape flowing from the neck"**, the **neck itself must exist** as a physical structure, so its **length and position** relative to the body and headstock must be preserved.
   - The **cutaway** is a distinctive feature of this model; although it may be stylized, its **presence and location** (upper right side) should be retained to preserve the guitar’s identity.
   - The **Fender logo** is mentioned only in terms of adding an emblem, not replacing it—therefore, it should **remain visible** under or beside the new emblem.
   - The **soundhole** is central to the guitar’s function and visual symmetry; even if stylized, it should remain **in the center of the body**, possibly integrated into the armor design.

Therefore, while textures, styles, and symbolic meanings are transformed, **the fundamental structure and count of key components must be preserved** to maintain logical coherence and prevent misidentification.

Preservation Targets List:
- The **six-string configuration** (number and path from bridge to tuning pegs)
- The **Fender logo** on the headstock
- The **cutaway shape** on the upper right side of the body
- The **soundhole’s central position** on the body
- The **neck’s length and connection** between body and headstock
- The **six tuning pegs** (three per side)
- The **overall silhouette** of the dreadnought cutaway body

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Retained Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The Fender logo is a core brand identifier and appears on the headstock of the original guitar. The editing instruction mentions adding an emblem on the headstock but does not specify replacing the existing logo. Therefore, the presence of the Fender logo must be preserved, even if partially overlaid by the new emblem. Its absence would result in loss of brand identity and misrepresentation of the original subject.
    Question: Is the Fender logo visible on the headstock?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The six-string configuration is a defining functional feature of the guitar. The instruction states that the strings become "muscle strands," but does not reduce their number. Each string must originate at the bridge and terminate at a tuning peg. Preserving the count ensures logical consistency and maintains the guitar’s identity as a six-string instrument.
    Question: Are there exactly six strings running from the bridge to the tuning pegs?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The cutaway on the upper right side of the body is a distinctive design feature of this guitar model. It allows easier access to higher frets and is visually identifiable. The instruction does not mention altering this shape, so it must remain intact, even if stylized as part of the armor.
    Question: Is there a cutaway on the upper right side of the guitar body?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The soundhole is centrally located on the body and is essential for the acoustic function of the guitar. Even when transformed into a superhero torso, the soundhole must remain in the same relative position to preserve the guitar’s anatomical logic. Its removal or relocation would disrupt the visual and functional integrity of the transformation.
    Question: Is the soundhole located in the center of the guitar body?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The neck connects the body to the headstock and serves as the conduit for the strings. The instruction specifies that a cape flows from the neck, indicating its continued existence as a structural element. Altering its length or position would break the spatial logic of the character design.
    Question: Does the neck extend directly from the body to the headstock without significant deviation?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The tuning pegs are critical for tuning the guitar. There are six total—three on each side of the headstock. The instruction does not specify changing their number or arrangement, so they must remain present and symmetrically placed. Their absence would make the guitar unrecognizable as a standard model.
    Question: Are there three tuning pegs on each side of the headstock?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The overall silhouette of the dreadnought cutaway body is a key visual identifier. While the texture may be changed to metallic, the outline must remain consistent to ensure the character is clearly derived from the original guitar. Any drastic reshaping would lose the reference to the original instrument.
    Question: Does the guitar body retain the classic dreadnought shape with a rounded lower bout and a cutaway on the upper right?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
