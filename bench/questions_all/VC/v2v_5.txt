### Step 1 - Description of Reference Image:
The subject is a zebra positioned in profile view, facing left. Its distinct black-and-white striped pattern is clearly visible across its body, face, and ears. The zebra is leaning forward toward a small birthday cake placed on a table. The cake has a zebra-striped design matching the zebra's pattern and a single lit candle on top. The background is an outdoor setting with greenery and blurred trees, suggesting a natural habitat.

### Thinking Process:
The editing instructions specify transforming the zebra into a stylized 3D chibi character while retaining its signature stripes and pattern. The scene is to be changed to include an oversized Instagram frame with a username and social media icons. The zebra's interaction with the cake is to be maintained in a playful manner. Therefore, the zebra's stripes, the cake's design, and the interaction are critical elements to retain.

### Allowed Changes List:
- The zebra's form can be changed to a 3D chibi style.
- The scene can be replaced with an Instagram frame.
- The background can be altered to fit the new scene.
- The size and proportions of the zebra and cake can be adjusted.

### Step 2 - Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged:

#### Thinking Process:
**Core Recognition Elements:** The zebra's black-and-white stripes are essential for recognizing it as a zebra. The cake's zebra-striped design is also crucial as it ties into the theme.  
**Functional/Logical Association Elements:** The zebra's interaction with the cake (leaning forward) must be retained to maintain the playful engagement described in the instructions.  
**Non-modified Element Deduction:** The candle on the cake and the table surface are minor details that contribute to the scene's coherence and should be retained.

#### Preservation Targets List:
- Zebra's black-and-white striped pattern
- Cake's zebra-striped design
- Zebra's interaction with the cake (leaning forward)
- Presence of the candle on the cake
- Table surface holding the cake
