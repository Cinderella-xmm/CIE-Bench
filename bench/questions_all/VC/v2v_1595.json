      "thinking_process": "The black-and-white panel pattern of the soccer ball—specifically the combination of 12 black pentagons and 20 white hexagons—is the universal identifier of a traditional soccer ball. This geometric configuration is not arbitrary; it defines the ball’s identity. Any deviation, such as altering the number or shape of panels, would make it unrecognizable as a standard soccer ball. Therefore, preserving this exact pattern is essential for identity retention. This is a core recognition feature, making it a 3-point question.",
      "question": "Does the soccer ball retain exactly 12 black pentagonal panels and 20 white hexagonal panels arranged in a spherical configuration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The spherical shape of the soccer ball is fundamental to its function and recognition. A flat or distorted shape would violate its physical identity. While the pop-art style may use stylized lines or halftone patterns, the underlying form must still convey a sphere. This is a core structural element, directly tied to the object’s identity, hence a 3-point weight.",
      "question": "Is the soccer ball depicted as a three-dimensional sphere with curved surfaces and proper perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The rectangular frame of the goalpost is a defining architectural feature of a soccer goal. Its four vertical and horizontal bars form a rigid rectangle, which is essential for identifying the object. Even in a stylized version, the basic rectangular outline must remain intact. Altering this would transform it into an unrelated structure. This is a core identity element, thus weighted at 3.",
      "question": "Does the goalpost maintain a rectangular frame with two vertical posts and one horizontal crossbar forming a standard goal shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The net of the goalpost consists of a regular grid of intersecting threads, forming a mesh pattern. This grid is a functional and visual hallmark of a soccer goal. While the pop-art style may exaggerate or stylize the lines, the grid structure must remain recognizable. Losing this would remove a key identifying feature of the goal. This is an important scene element, so it receives a 2-point weight.",
      "question": "Is the net of the goalpost composed of a visible grid pattern of intersecting lines forming square or rectangular cells?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The relative position of the ball in front of the goalpost establishes the scene’s spatial logic. The ball is placed in the foreground, partially obscuring the lower part of the goal, suggesting motion toward the goal. This compositional relationship is crucial for narrative coherence. If reversed or altered, the scene loses its intended meaning. This is a key logical element, so it is assigned 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the soccer ball positioned in the foreground, in front of the goalpost, with part of the goal visible behind it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The seam lines between the panels of the soccer ball are critical for defining the boundaries of the pentagons and hexagons. These lines are not just decorative—they are structural indicators of the ball’s construction. In a pop-art style, they may be thickened or stylized, but their presence and alignment must be preserved to maintain the panel layout. This is a detail-level element but essential for accurate representation, hence 1 point.",
      "question": "Are the seams between the black and white panels of the soccer ball clearly visible and aligned with the edges of the pentagons and hexagons?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The overall composition places the ball centrally in the foreground and the goal behind it, creating a balanced and focused scene. This layout is not random—it directs attention to the interaction between the two objects. While lighting and style may change, the central placement of the ball and the background positioning of the goal must be maintained for visual coherence. This is a minor but important compositional detail, so it is given 1 point.",
      "question": "Is the soccer ball centered in the foreground and the goalpost positioned directly behind it in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
