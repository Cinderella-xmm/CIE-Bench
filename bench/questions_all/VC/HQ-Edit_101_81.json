      "thinking_process": "The Tree Pose is uniquely defined by the alignment of the legs — specifically, the lifted foot resting on the inner thigh of the standing leg. This is the core biomechanical feature that distinguishes it from other balancing poses. Any deviation (e.g., foot on calf, knee bent differently) would alter the pose's identity. Thus, the precise placement of the foot on the inner thigh is a critical visual identifier and must be preserved.",
      "question": "Is the lifted foot placed on the inner thigh of the standing leg?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The hands forming Anjali Mudra (palms pressed together above the head) is a defining gesture of the Tree Pose. It is both a symbolic and structural component of the posture. Changing the hand position (e.g., arms down, open palms) would fundamentally alter the pose's identity and spiritual intent. Therefore, the specific hand configuration is a core recognition element.",
      "question": "Are the hands pressed together in prayer position directly above the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The yoga mat is a functional object necessary for the practice of yoga, especially in balance poses. Its presence under the feet provides stability and context. Removing it or replacing it with another surface would disrupt the logical coherence of the scene, even if the style is changed. The mat's shape and position are key to maintaining the realism of the practice.",
      "question": "Is the woman standing on a flat rectangular yoga mat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The feet are bare, which is standard in yoga practice and essential for grip and balance. Wearing shoes or socks would contradict the nature of the pose and the intended representation. The visibility of the bare soles and toes is a minor but significant detail that reinforces authenticity.",
      "question": "Are the feet bare with no footwear?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The closed eyes and calm facial expression convey the meditative state associated with the pose. While not structurally vital, they are key to the emotional and spiritual identity of the image. Altering the eyes to be open or showing tension would misrepresent the intended serenity.",
      "question": "Are the eyes closed and the face relaxed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The upright, centered stance with the body aligned vertically is essential for the balance and symmetry of the Tree Pose. Tilting the body or shifting weight would compromise the pose's integrity. This orientation is a foundational element of the posture’s visual identity.",
      "question": "Is the body upright and centered on the mat with no leaning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The position of the arms — raised straight up with palms together — is a distinct feature of the pose. Any deviation in arm angle or separation would change the silhouette and meaning of the gesture. This alignment is crucial for correct identification of the pose.",
      "question": "Are the arms fully extended upward with elbows straight and palms touching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
