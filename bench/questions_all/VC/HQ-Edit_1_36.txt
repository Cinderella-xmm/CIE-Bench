Description of reference image: The subject is an elderly woman with silver-gray hair styled in a traditional, elegant updo, facing forward with a gentle smile. Her facial features show natural aging details such as fine wrinkles around the eyes and mouth, soft skin texture, and warm, rosy cheeks. She wears a Korean hanbok, specifically a jeogori (top) with a wide white collar and floral embroidery along the inner edges—featuring pink, purple, and red flowers on a greenish-gray background. The outer layer of the jeogori is semi-transparent, with a gradient transitioning from pale peach to light blue, overlaid with subtle floral patterns. A coral-colored ribbon bow is tied at the front center of the chest. The chima (skirt) appears to be a soft cream or beige color, slightly visible beneath the top. The background consists of lush green foliage and blooming pink cherry blossoms, with a dark tiled roof partially visible at the top edge, suggesting a traditional East Asian architectural setting. The lighting is soft and natural, enhancing the peaceful and serene atmosphere.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions word by word:  
- "Create a series of art postcards capturing a semi-cartoon elder in hanbok" → This implies a **style transformation** (from realistic to semi-cartoon), so the **artistic style** can change.  
- "Enhanced floral motifs and pastel colors" → **Floral patterns and color palette** can be enhanced or altered for vibrancy, meaning **design elements** like flower density, color saturation, and tone are modifiable.  
- "Present in a floral-decorated envelope with green vine accents" → This introduces **new framing elements** (envelope and vines) not present in the original; thus, **the surrounding presentation** is allowed to change.  
- "Adjust hanbok's gradient color for vibrancy against a lush background" → **Color gradients** and **background luminosity** can be modified.  
- "Ideal for collection in a stylish album" → Suggests **contextual use**, not visual content, so no direct impact on image content.

From this, we infer that:
- The **subject’s identity** (elderly woman in hanbok) must remain recognizable.
- The **hanbok’s form and structure** (jeogori, chima, ribbon, collar) may retain shape but allow stylization.
- **Floral motifs** and **colors** are explicitly permitted to be enhanced — hence **not fixed**.
- **Background elements** (cherry blossoms, greenery, roof) are part of the scene but can be adjusted for “lushness” — so **not strictly preserved**.
- However, **core identity markers** (such as the woman’s face, age indicators, hairstyle, clothing silhouette) must remain identifiable despite stylistic changes.

Allowed Changes List:
- Artistic style (realistic → semi-cartoon)
- Color intensity and gradient of the hanbok
- Floral motif density and design
- Background vibrancy and composition
- Addition of envelope and vine accents (in final presentation)
- Lighting and tone adjustments

Step 2 – Determine the elements that should remain unchanged

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements:  
The elderly woman’s **face**, particularly her **age-related features** (wrinkles, skin texture, expression), **silver-gray hair**, and **traditional updo** are essential to identifying her as an elder in a culturally specific context. These define her identity and distinguish her from younger or stylized figures. If these are altered beyond recognition, she loses her core identity.  
The **hanbok’s structure** — including the **white collar**, **V-neckline**, **ribbon bow**, and **layered fabric** — is a cultural identifier. While colors and patterns can be enhanced, the **form and placement** of these components must remain intact to preserve the garment’s authenticity.  

Functional/logical association elements:  
The **position of the ribbon bow at the chest center** is functional in traditional hanbok design; changing its location would disrupt the garment’s logic. Similarly, the **collar’s V-shape and orientation** are key to the jeogori’s identity.  
The **woman’s posture** — upright, facing forward, smiling gently — establishes the emotional tone and compositional balance. Altering this would affect the intended mood and narrative.

Non-modified element deduction:  
After excluding allowed changes (style, color, floral detail enhancement, background modification), the remaining **unmentioned visual specifics** must be retained:
- The **shape and arrangement of the hair bun**
- The **relative size and position of facial features**
- The **fabric drape and transparency** of the outer jeogori layer
- The **presence of the coral ribbon bow** at the chest
- The **overall silhouette** of the figure

These are not explicitly changed in instructions, and their retention ensures visual coherence and identity preservation.

Preservation Targets List:
- The elderly woman’s facial structure, including wrinkles, skin texture, and warm smile
- The silver-gray hair styled in a traditional updo
- The white collar and V-shaped neckline of the jeogori
- The coral-colored ribbon bow positioned at the center of the chest
- The layered, semi-transparent outer jeogori with visible floral embroidery along the inner edge
- The overall upright, forward-facing posture of the subject

Q1:  
Thinking process: The elderly woman’s face, especially the network of wrinkles around the eyes and mouth, is the core identifier of her age and emotional expression. These features are unique to her identity in the original image. If they are smoothed out or stylized into cartoon-like simplicity, she becomes unrecognizable as the same individual. Therefore, the presence and pattern of facial wrinkles are critical for identity retention and must be preserved. This is a 3-point element because it defines the subject’s core identity.  
Question: Does the edited image retain the distinct network of wrinkles around the eyes and mouth of the elderly woman?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The silver-gray hair styled in a traditional updo is a defining feature of both her age and cultural representation. The specific shape of the bun and the way the hair is parted and swept back are visually distinctive. Changing the hairstyle significantly (e.g., flattening, simplifying, or altering color) would compromise her identity. Thus, the hairstyle’s form and color must be preserved. This is a 3-point element due to its role in cultural and personal identification.  
Question: Is the silver-gray hair styled in a traditional updo with a clear central part and rounded bun at the back?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The white collar of the jeogori is a structural hallmark of Korean hanbok. Its crisp white color and V-shape contrast with the colored fabric and frame the face. Removing or altering its shape or color would misrepresent the garment. It is a key functional and cultural element. This is a 3-point element because it is a core component of the hanbok’s identity.  
Question: Is the white collar of the jeogori clearly visible and forming a V-shape at the neckline?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The coral-colored ribbon bow tied at the chest center is a signature decorative element of the hanbok. Its position and color contrast make it a focal point. Moving it or changing its form would disrupt the garment’s symmetry and authenticity. Though color can be enhanced, its **presence and placement** must remain. This is a 2-point element because it is important for garment recognition but less critical than facial features.  
Question: Is there a coral-colored ribbon bow located at the center of the chest, tied in a neat knot?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The semi-transparent outer layer of the jeogori, with visible floral embroidery along the inner edge, contributes to the garment’s aesthetic and cultural accuracy. The floral patterns are embedded in the fabric and follow a specific layout. While the instruction allows enhancement of floral motifs, the **presence of these embroidered flowers** along the inner border must remain. Their removal would alter the hanbok’s design integrity. This is a 2-point element as it supports cultural authenticity.  
Question: Are there visible floral embroidery patterns along the inner edge of the jeogori, featuring pink, purple, and red flowers on a greenish-gray background?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The upright, forward-facing posture of the subject is essential to the composition and emotional tone. It conveys dignity and serenity. Altering her stance (e.g., turning sideways, bending) would change the narrative and visual balance. Though the instruction allows artistic style changes, the **posture** remains a logical anchor. This is a 2-point element because it maintains spatial and emotional coherence.  
Question: Is the elderly woman standing upright and facing directly toward the viewer?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The layered structure of the hanbok — with the semi-transparent outer jeogori over a solid underlayer — creates depth and texture. This layering is a key design feature. Even if colors are enhanced, the **visual separation between layers** must remain. Losing this would flatten the garment’s appearance. This is a 1-point element because it is a secondary detail affecting texture but not core identity.  
Question: Is the outer jeogori visibly layered over an inner garment, creating a translucent effect?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1
