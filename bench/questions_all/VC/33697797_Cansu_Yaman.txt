**Step 1 – Analyze the Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a vibrant greenhouse interior filled with lush tropical plants, including large-leafed banana-like plants in the foreground, ferns, palms, and flowering species arranged on tiered wooden shelves with green mesh sides. The structure features a glass roof supported by metal beams, with a translucent woven shade canopy suspended beneath it. The floor is paved with gray stone tiles. Potted plants are placed on mobile shelving units with wheels, and some flowers display bright pink and red hues. Natural light streams through the glass ceiling, illuminating the scene. A prominent banana plant with broad green leaves dominates the right side of the frame, partially obscuring the view. In the background, more potted plants and colorful blooms are visible, along with structural elements like windows and doors.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction states: *"Transform the vibrant greenhouse into an enchanted botanical oasis, where each plant morphs into whimsical characters resembling fairytale creatures. Add intricate vine patterns to the leaves, let flowers bloom as magical orbs, and turn the shelves into floating moss-covered islands. The glass ceiling should become a cascade of iridescent foliage, cascading downwards like a verdant waterfall."*  

This instruction explicitly allows transformation of:
- **Plant forms**: From real plants to whimsical fairytale creatures (morphing allowed).
- **Leaf textures**: Addition of "intricate vine patterns" → leaf appearance can change.
- **Flowers**: To become "magical orbs" → form and function of flowers can be altered.
- **Shelves**: Turned into "floating moss-covered islands" → structural and spatial transformation permitted.
- **Glass ceiling**: Transformed into a "cascade of iridescent foliage" → original ceiling structure is replaced.

Thus, the following are **allowed to change**:
- The **form and identity** of individual plants (e.g., turning them into creatures).
- The **appearance of leaves** (adding vine patterns).
- The **nature of flowers** (replacing them with glowing orbs).
- The **structure and position of shelves** (floating, moss-covered).
- The **ceiling material and design** (glass replaced with iridescent foliage).

However, the instruction does **not** mention changing or removing:
- The **overall layout** of the greenhouse space (e.g., relative positioning of shelves, central walkway).
- The **presence of the stone-paved floor**.
- The **existence of potted plants** (even if transformed, they must still be present in some form).
- The **basic architectural framework** (metal beams, window grids, door outlines) — unless implied by transformation.

But since the instruction says “transform the greenhouse,” and specifies dramatic changes to ceiling and shelves, we infer that **only the core structural skeleton** may remain intact if necessary for coherence.

Therefore:

**Allowed Changes List:**
- Plant shapes and identities (can become creatures)
- Leaf surface patterns (can have added vines)
- Flower forms (can become magical orbs)
- Shelf structures (can float, be moss-covered)
- Ceiling composition (can be replaced with foliage cascade)
- Light effects (can be enhanced magically)

**Step 2 – Determine the Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
We now identify what **must not be changed**, based on exclusion from the allowed list and logical necessity for visual consistency.

1. **Core recognition elements**:
   - The **stone-paved floor** is a key environmental feature. It provides grounding and spatial continuity. Even if shelves float, the floor remains a fixed reference point.
   - The **metal support beams and glass panes** of the roof’s frame are part of the greenhouse’s architecture. Though the *ceiling itself* is transformed, the **underlying structural grid** (beams, trusses, window frames) may need to be retained for architectural logic, especially since the instruction mentions “cascade of iridescent foliage” — which could overlay but not erase the structural skeleton.
   - The **position and general layout** of the shelving units — while their form changes, their placement in the space (e.g., left-to-right alignment, depth of aisles) likely needs retention to preserve scene coherence.

2. **Functional/logical association elements**:
   - The **pots and containers** holding plants are functional objects. Even if plants transform into creatures, the pots serve as anchors — they maintain the idea of cultivated plants within a greenhouse. Removing them would break the logical connection between the setting and its contents.
   - The **mobile nature of the shelves** (indicated by visible wheels) suggests functionality. While shelves may float, the presence of wheels might still be preserved or reinterpreted (e.g., as floating platforms with wheel-like designs), so this detail should be retained visually.

3. **Non-modified element deduction**:
   - After excluding all allowed transformations, the **gray stone tile flooring**, **metal beam framework**, **window grid pattern**, **visible wheels on shelves**, and **container pots** remain unmentioned in the transformation instructions. These are not specified for change, and altering them would disrupt spatial logic and recognition of the greenhouse environment.

Thus, these elements must be **retained** even after magical transformation.

**Preservation Targets List:**
- Gray stone-paved floor
- Metal support beams and window grid framework of the greenhouse
- Visible wheels on the shelving units
- Presence of black plastic pots and other plant containers
- General spatial layout: central aisle, left-side shelving, right-side large plant

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

**Q1:**  
Thinking process: The gray stone-paved floor is a foundational element of the greenhouse’s environment. Its texture and color provide contrast to the greenery and anchor the scene spatially. If removed or replaced without trace, the setting loses its terrestrial base, undermining the original context. This is a core environmental feature, essential for identifying the location as a greenhouse, and thus must be preserved. Loss would make the scene unrecognizable as derived from the original. Therefore, it is a high-weight element.
Question: Is the gray stone-paved floor present in the edited image?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

**Q2:**  
Thinking process: The metal support beams and window grid framework define the architectural identity of the greenhouse. They are visible throughout the image and form the skeleton of the structure. Although the ceiling is to be transformed, the underlying beams are structural necessities. Removing them would imply a complete loss of the building's form, violating the continuity of the scene. Their presence is critical for maintaining the greenhouse’s identity. Thus, this is a core structural element.
Question: Are the metal support beams and window grid patterns visible in the greenhouse structure?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

**Q3:**  
Thinking process: The wheels on the shelving units indicate mobility and functionality. They are small but distinct details that contribute to the realism of the greenhouse setting. Even if shelves become floating islands, the presence of wheels may be stylized or reimagined (e.g., as glowing orbs or mechanical parts), but their existence must be preserved to maintain continuity. Their absence would suggest a total erasure of the original functional design.
Question: Are visible wheels attached to the base of the shelving units?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

**Q4:**  
Thinking process: The black plastic pots are consistent across multiple plants and serve as containers. They are functional and identifiable. Even if the plants inside transform into creatures, the pots remain as physical anchors. Their presence confirms the cultivation aspect of the greenhouse. Removing them entirely would disconnect the scene from its original purpose. Thus, they are important functional elements.
Question: Are black plastic pots visible under the plants on the shelves?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

**Q5:**  
Thinking process: The large banana-like plant in the foreground with broad green leaves is a dominant visual feature. Its shape and size establish scale and depth. Even if it becomes a whimsical creature, its basic silhouette and position must be preserved to maintain spatial orientation. Altering its position or removing it entirely would disrupt the viewer’s sense of the scene’s composition. It is a key compositional element.
Question: Is the large plant with broad green leaves positioned in the foreground on the right side of the image?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

**Q6:**  
Thinking process: The central aisle formed by the arrangement of shelves is a key spatial element. It guides the viewer’s eye through the scene and maintains the greenhouse’s navigable layout. Even if shelves float, the path between them should remain clear and consistent. Preserving this spatial flow ensures the scene remains coherent and recognizable.
Question: Is there a clear central aisle running through the greenhouse, flanked by shelving units on both sides?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

**Q7:**  
Thinking process: The woven shade canopy suspended beneath the glass roof is a distinctive feature. It is made of a light brown, perforated material and adds texture to the upper space. While the ceiling is to be transformed into a foliage cascade, this canopy may be integrated into the new design or replaced. However, its presence contributes to the lighting and atmosphere. Since it is not explicitly mentioned in the transformation, and it is a unique textural detail, its retention helps preserve authenticity.
Question: Is the light brown woven shade canopy visible beneath the glass roof?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1
