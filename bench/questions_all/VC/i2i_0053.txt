Description of reference image: The subject consists of a banana holder with bananas placed on it. The banana holder has a metallic curved arm attached to a wooden base. The bananas rest naturally on the curved arm, with their bright yellow peels visible. The scene is set indoors against a neutral background featuring a closed door and a plain wall.

### Step 1: Allowed Changes List

Thinking process: 
The instructions specify transforming the image into a cartoon farm sticker style with warm, chibi-like features, bold outlines, and a green hill background. Thus, the following elements can be altered:

- Subject form: Bananas and the banana holder can adopt a chibi-like appearance.
- Artistic style: The image can transition into cartoonish aesthetics with bold outlines, warm tones, and simplified shapes.
- Scene: The indoor setting can be replaced with a cartoonish green hill background.
- Color palette: Adjustments can be made to align with warm and inviting cartoon tones.
- Proportion and angle: The size and perspective of the subject can be exaggerated for a chibi effect.

Allowed Changes List:
Specific element 1 that allows for changes: Subject form and artistic style transformation.
Specific element 2 that allows for changes: Replacement of the scene and background.
Specific element 3 that allows for changes: Adjustment of color palette.
Specific element 4 that allows for changes: Exaggeration of proportions and angles.

### Step 2: Determining Elements That Should Remain Unchanged

Thinking process: 

Core recognition elements:
- The bananas and the banana holder should remain identifiable as bananas and a functional holder post-editing. Their unique forms and functional relationship must be preserved.

Functional/logical association elements:
- The bananas resting on the holder suggests a supportive structure, which must logically persist even after the transformation.

Remaining elements based on visual coherence and common sense:
- The relative positions of the bananas on the holder should be consistent with the original placement.

Preservation Targets List:
(Element 1 that should be maintained: The bananas’ form and color)
(Element 2 that should be maintained: The banana holder’s form and function)
(Element 3 that should be maintained: The relative positioning of bananas on the holder)

### Step 3: Generate Yes/No Questions

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The bananas' form is crucial for recognition; losing the banana shape and yellow hue would make them unidentifiable.
    Question: Are the bananas represented with their characteristic elongated curve and yellow color? 
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The banana holder's function depends on its curved metal support and wooden base.
    Question: Is the banana holder depicted with a curved metal arm supported by a wooden base? 
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The natural placement on the holder maintains the scene's logic.
    Question: Do the bananas still rest naturally on the curved metal arm? 
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The bananas' bunch format is a unique detail indicating multiple bananas together.
    Question: Are the bananas shown in a bunch, connected at the top?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The wooden texture of the base adds realism, ensuring it isn't purely cartoonified upon transformation.
    Question: Does the wooden base of the banana holder retain its wood-like texture?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
