Description of reference image: The image shows two individuals standing on a sandy beach during sunset. They are facing away from the camera, each holding a surfboard. The person on the left has curly hair and is wearing a black shirt and shorts, while the person on the right has long hair and is wearing a black swimsuit. Both surfboards are upright, with the left one being yellow and the right one having red and teal sections. The sun is low on the horizon, casting a warm orange glow over the ocean and sand.

### Step 1 - Allowed Changes List:

Thinking process: The editing instructions specify replacing the surfers with pandas while keeping the sunset and beach setting intact. This means the human figures can be replaced with pandas, but their positions, postures, and the act of holding surfboards must remain consistent. The background, including the sunset, ocean waves, and sandy beach, should stay unchanged.

Allowed Changes List:
Specific element 1 that allows for changes: Human figures can be replaced with pandas.
Specific element 2 that allows for changes: The appearance of the surfers' clothing can be removed or altered to fit the pandas.

### Step 2 - Preservation Targets List:

Thinking process: Core recognition elements include the pandas holding surfboards in the same positions as the humans. Functional/logical elements involve the pandas maintaining the same stance and interaction with the surfboards. Remaining elements like the sunset, ocean, and beach must be kept intact for visual coherence.

Preservation Targets List:
(Element 1 that should be maintained): The sunset and its reflection on the water.
(Element 2 that should be maintained): The sandy beach and its texture.
(Element 3 that should be maintained): The ocean waves and their movement.
(Element 4 that should be maintained): The surfboards' positions and colors.
(Element 5 that should be maintained): The pandas' postures matching the original humans'.

### Step 3 - Question Generation:

Q1:  
Thinking process: The sunset is a core visual element that defines the scene's mood and lighting. Its presence and reflection on the water are crucial for maintaining the image's identity.
Question: Is the sunset visible on the horizon with its reflection on the water?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
Weight: 3

Q2:  
Thinking process: The sandy beach is an essential part of the scene, providing context for the surfers/pandas. Its texture adds realism and ties the image together.
Question: Does the sandy beach retain its texture and extend across the bottom of the image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
Weight: 2

Q3:  
Thinking process: The ocean waves contribute significantly to the beach setting. Their movement and placement relative to the surfers/pandas are important for scene consistency.
Question: Are the ocean waves present, showing natural movement near the shore?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
Weight: 2

Q4:  
Thinking process: The surfboards are key props that connect the pandas to the surfing theme. Their colors and positions must match the original setup.
Question: Do the surfboards retain their original colors (yellow on the left, red and teal on the right) and upright positions?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
Weight: 3

Q5:  
Thinking process: The pandas' postures must mirror those of the original humans to maintain logical consistency and action portrayal.
Question: Are the pandas positioned similarly to the original humans, with one arm holding the surfboard and both facing the sunset?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
Weight: 3
