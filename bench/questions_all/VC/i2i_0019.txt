Description of reference image: The subject is an elephant shown in profile, eating grass with its trunk. The elephant has large ears, a wrinkled skin texture, and a noticeable mud patch on one ear. The background shows a rural setting with wooden structures, possibly under a thatched roof, along with a partially visible motorcycle. The ground beneath the elephant appears to have some greenery, possibly grass.

### Step 1: Analyze Allowed Changes  
**Thinking process:**  
The instructions specify transforming the elephant into a 3D chibi-style figurine, changing its form and material. This means the elephant's size, proportions, and material appearance can change significantly. The natural background and its specific details can also be entirely replaced. However, the grass-eating pose and the general silhouette of the elephant (like its large ears and trunk) must be retained.  

**Allowed Changes List:**  
- Specific element 1 that allows for changes: Transforming the elephant's size and proportions to chibi style.  
- Specific element 2 that allows for changes: Replacing the background with a new setting appropriate for a product photo composition.  
- Specific element 3 that allows for changes: Changing the material appearance to matte polymer clay with an acrylic dome.  

### Step 2: Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged  
**Thinking process:**  
Core Recognition Elements:  
- The elephant’s iconic features like large ears, trunk, and overall silhouette should remain identifiable even in chibi form.  
- The grass-eating pose must stay consistent to align with the instructions.  

Functional/Logical Association Elements:  
- The elephant holding grass with its trunk must be preserved, as this action is central to the figure's pose.  

Remaining Visual Coherence Elements:  
- The detailed texture of the elephant's skin, while it can be simplified, should still hint at the original wrinkled texture.  
- The elephant’s general color scheme should remain greyish with the same brownish tone on the ear.  

**Preservation Targets List:**  
- The general silhouette and iconic features of the elephant.  
- The grass-eating pose involving the trunk.  
- The textured representation of the elephant’s skin.  
- The general color scheme of the elephant.

### Step 3: Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements  

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The general silhouette and iconic features, like the large ears and trunk, are crucial for recognizing the animal as an elephant in chibi form. Losing these would make the subject unidentifiable as an elephant, hence a weight of 3 points.
    Question: Does the figurine retain the elephant's large ears and trunk as part of its general silhouette?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}  

{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The grass-eating pose with the trunk holding grass is a functional action and essential for the figure's intended design. Without this pose, the figurine loses its intended context, warranting a weight of 3 points.
    Question: Is the chibi figurine depicted holding grass with its trunk?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}  

{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The texture of the elephant's skin is a secondary detail that adds realism to the figurine, making it more recognizable as a transformed version of a real elephant. While it could be simplified, a complete absence would detract from the coherence. Hence, a weight of 2 points.
    Question: Does the figurine's surface include a subtle representation of the elephant's wrinkled skin texture?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}  

{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The color scheme is an important visual cue to retain the identity of the elephant. A significant deviation from grey skin and brownish ear tones would compromise the recognition value. Therefore, a weight of 2 points.
    Question: Does the figurine maintain the elephant’s grey body color and brownish ear tone?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2

    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The "Jungle Friend" inscription adds thematic significance and ties the design to its setting. Its presence ensures the figurine carries the intended narrative. Thus, it is an important detail worth 2 points.
    Question: Is "Jungle Friend" engraved around the edge of the base?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
