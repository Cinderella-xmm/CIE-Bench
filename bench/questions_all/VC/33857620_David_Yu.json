      "thinking_process": "The window on the front of the chalet is a key identification feature distinguishing it from other structures. It is centrally located and framed in white, making it a focal point. Even if the chalet is transformed into a shell, the window must remain visible or identifiable to maintain continuity with the original. Its absence would make the structure unrecognizable as the original chalet, undermining the transformation’s grounding in reality. This is a core identity element, thus weighted at 3 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The red auxiliary structure to the left of the chalet is a minor but distinctive feature. It adds context to the scene, suggesting human presence. Its removal or replacement without trace would break the scene’s authenticity. While it may be integrated into the creature’s body, its **presence and color** must be retained. This is an important scene element that supports the narrative of habitation, hence a weight of 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the small red structure located to the left of the main chalet still present in the transformed scene?",

      "thinking_process": "The stream’s path is essential for spatial coherence. It guides the viewer’s eye and connects the foreground to the background. If the stream’s direction is altered or removed, the scene loses its environmental logic. Even if transformed into veins, the **flow pattern** must follow the original trajectory. This is a critical compositional element, so it carries a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Does the waterway flow from the bottom-right corner toward the center-left of the image, maintaining its original course?",

      "thinking_process": "The large snow patch directly in front of the chalet is a key visual anchor. It is one of the most prominent snow formations and serves as the base for the \"wings\" transformation. Its **shape and location** must be preserved to ensure the metamorphosis is coherent. Removing or relocating it would disrupt the transformation logic. This is a major scene element, thus weighted at 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the large patch of snow located directly in front of the chalet still visible and positioned in the same place?",

      "thinking_process": "The moss-covered rocks along the streambed contribute to the texture and realism of the environment. They define the stream’s edges and add depth. Their presence helps ground the fantastical elements in natural detail. While they may be stylized, their **distribution and mossy texture** must remain consistent. This is a detail-level element, but important for visual coherence, so it receives 1 point.",

      "thinking_process": "The chalet’s position in the mid-ground, slightly right of center, is crucial for composition. It establishes balance in the scene. Changing its location would distort the spatial relationship with the stream and mountains. Even if transformed, its **relative position** must be maintained. This is a core compositional anchor, so it is weighted at 3 points.",

Even if the atmosphere is made more ethereal, the **silhouettes and snow-capped ridges** must remain visible to preserve the scene’s geographic identity.
