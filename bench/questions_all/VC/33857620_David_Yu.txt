**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

Description of reference image:  
The subject is a small, triangular-roofed wooden chalet situated in a high-altitude alpine valley. The chalet has a dark brown exterior with a white-framed window centered on its front face, and it stands slightly elevated on a rocky, moss-covered slope. To the left of the chalet, there is a smaller red structure, possibly a shed or outhouse. The surrounding terrain consists of uneven, rocky ground interspersed with patches of snow, especially along the upper slopes and near the base of the mountains. A shallow, meandering stream flows across the foreground, composed of clear water flowing over flat stones and gravel, creating reflective pools. The stream winds from the lower right toward the center-left of the frame. The background features rugged mountain peaks partially shrouded in low-hanging mist and clouds, with remnants of snow clinging to their slopes. The sky is overcast, contributing to a cool, muted lighting atmosphere. The vegetation is sparse, consisting mainly of low-lying grasses and moss growing among rocks.

Thinking process:  
The editing instruction explicitly states a transformation of the entire scene into an **ethereal creature**, using symbolic morphing:  
- The **chalet's triangular roof becomes a protective shell** → form of the roof can change  
- The **snowy sections become shimmering, translucent wings** → snow areas can be reimagined  
- The **rocky terrain evolves into robust legs with mossy textures** → terrain morphology can shift  
- The **stream transforms into glowing veins** → water flow becomes internal lifeforce  
- The overall atmosphere becomes **misty and dreamy** → lighting and mood are altered  

This indicates that the **subject (chalet)** and **scene elements (terrain, stream, snow)** are all subject to **formal transformation**, but not necessarily destruction. However, the instruction does **not** say to remove or alter the **core visual identity** of these elements — rather, it instructs to *reimagine* them in a metaphorical way. Therefore, while the **shape and function** of the elements may change, the **original visual components must still be traceable** in the edited version, as they serve as the basis for the transformation.

Allowed Changes List:  
- The triangular roof of the chalet can be transformed into a shell-like structure  
- Snow patches can be reinterpreted as translucent wings  
- Rocky terrain can be reshaped into leg-like forms  
- The stream can be stylized into glowing veins  
- The overall atmosphere can be enhanced with ethereal lighting and mist effects  
- The color palette can shift toward cooler, luminous tones to support the magical theme

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

Thinking process:  
To preserve **image consistency**, we must identify what **cannot be changed** due to being either **core recognition features** or **functional/logical anchors**. Even though the instruction allows transformation, certain **visual truths** from the original must remain intact to maintain coherence between the original and edited versions.

**Core recognition elements**:  
- The **presence and position** of the chalet in the landscape are central to the composition. Although its form changes, its **location** (mid-ground, slightly right of center) and **relationship to the stream and snow patches** must be preserved for spatial logic.  
- The **window on the chalet’s front face** is a distinct feature — its presence and placement help identify the building as human-made and habitable. Even if the roof becomes a shell, the window must remain visible or logically implied.  
- The **small red structure** to the left of the chalet is a secondary object that contributes to the narrative of habitation. Its existence should be retained, even if morphed into part of the creature’s anatomy.  
- The **stream’s path** from bottom-right to center-left is a key compositional element. It defines movement through the scene and must retain its **flow direction and general trajectory**, even if rendered as veins.  
- The **patch of snow directly in front of the chalet** is a major visual anchor. Its shape and location are critical for identifying the area where the "wings" will emerge. It must remain recognizable.  

**Functional/logical association elements**:  
- The **spatial hierarchy** of the scene — chalet above stream, stream leading to lake, mountains behind — must be preserved to maintain environmental logic. Even if transformed into a creature, the **relative positioning** of parts must align with the original layout.  
- The **connection between the chalet and the stream** implies a natural habitat; this relationship must remain intact in the metaphoric form.  

**Non-modified element deduction**:  
After excluding allowed transformations (roof → shell, snow → wings, etc.), the following **must remain**:
- The **window on the chalet**
- The **red auxiliary structure**
- The **overall layout of the stream**
- The **position of the snow patch in front of the chalet**
- The **presence of moss-covered rocks along the stream**
- The **color contrast between the brown chalet and green moss**

These elements are not mentioned in the transformation instructions, so they must be preserved to avoid losing the original scene’s identity.

Preservation Targets List:  
- The window on the front of the chalet  
- The red auxiliary structure to the left of the chalet  
- The stream’s path from bottom-right to center-left  
- The large snow patch directly in front of the chalet  
- The moss-covered rocks along the streambed  
- The relative position of the chalet in the mid-ground, slightly right of center

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

Q1:  
Thinking process: The window on the front of the chalet is a key identification feature distinguishing it from other structures. It is centrally located and framed in white, making it a focal point. Even if the chalet is transformed into a shell, the window must remain visible or identifiable to maintain continuity with the original. Its absence would make the structure unrecognizable as the original chalet, undermining the transformation’s grounding in reality. This is a core identity element, thus weighted at 3 points.  
Question: Is the white-framed window visible on the front face of the transformed structure?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The red auxiliary structure to the left of the chalet is a minor but distinctive feature. It adds context to the scene, suggesting human presence. Its removal or replacement without trace would break the scene’s authenticity. While it may be integrated into the creature’s body, its **presence and color** must be retained. This is an important scene element that supports the narrative of habitation, hence a weight of 2 points.  
Question: Is the small red structure located to the left of the main chalet still present in the transformed scene?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The stream’s path is essential for spatial coherence. It guides the viewer’s eye and connects the foreground to the background. If the stream’s direction is altered or removed, the scene loses its environmental logic. Even if transformed into veins, the **flow pattern** must follow the original trajectory. This is a critical compositional element, so it carries a weight of 3 points.  
Question: Does the waterway flow from the bottom-right corner toward the center-left of the image, maintaining its original course?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The large snow patch directly in front of the chalet is a key visual anchor. It is one of the most prominent snow formations and serves as the base for the "wings" transformation. Its **shape and location** must be preserved to ensure the metamorphosis is coherent. Removing or relocating it would disrupt the transformation logic. This is a major scene element, thus weighted at 2 points.  
Question: Is the large patch of snow located directly in front of the chalet still visible and positioned in the same place?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The moss-covered rocks along the streambed contribute to the texture and realism of the environment. They define the stream’s edges and add depth. Their presence helps ground the fantastical elements in natural detail. While they may be stylized, their **distribution and mossy texture** must remain consistent. This is a detail-level element, but important for visual coherence, so it receives 1 point.  
Question: Are moss-covered rocks visible along the edges of the stream in the transformed scene?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The chalet’s position in the mid-ground, slightly right of center, is crucial for composition. It establishes balance in the scene. Changing its location would distort the spatial relationship with the stream and mountains. Even if transformed, its **relative position** must be maintained. This is a core compositional anchor, so it is weighted at 3 points.  
Question: Is the transformed structure located in the mid-ground, slightly to the right of the center of the image?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The mountains in the background, partially obscured by mist, provide context and scale. Their presence is necessary to maintain the alpine setting. Even if the atmosphere is made more ethereal, the **silhouettes and snow-capped ridges** must remain visible to preserve the scene’s geographic identity. This is an important environmental element, thus weighted at 2 points.  
Question: Are the mountain peaks visible in the background, with snow patches and mist covering their upper portions?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2
