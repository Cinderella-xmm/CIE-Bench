      "thinking_process": "The bright yellow color of the kayak is its most prominent and defining feature, distinguishing it from other watercraft and making it instantly recognizable. Changing this color would fundamentally alter the object’s identity and visual impact. As a core identification element, its retention is critical for preserving the original subject’s authenticity. This is a 3-point weight because the color is a primary identifier of the kayak in the image.",
      "question": "Is the kayak still bright yellow in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The black bungee cords arranged in an X-pattern on the kayak deck are a signature design feature of many recreational kayaks. They serve both functional and aesthetic purposes and are visually distinctive. Removing or altering them would make the kayak appear incomplete or unrecognizable as a typical model. This is a 2-point weight because it is a key accessory that contributes significantly to the kayak’s identity.",
      "question": "Are the black bungee cords in an X-pattern present on both ends of the kayak deck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The black padded seat inside the kayak is a functional component that defines the interior space and user interaction point. Its presence and shape are consistent with standard kayak designs. Altering or omitting it would change the kayak’s usability representation and reduce its realism. This is a 2-point weight because it is a major internal feature tied to the object’s function.",
      "question": "Is there a black padded seat visible inside the kayak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The skateboard’s dark gray grip tape surface is a defining characteristic of modern skateboards, providing traction and visual contrast. Its texture and color are essential for identifying the object. Changing it would misrepresent the skateboard’s material and purpose. This is a 2-point weight because it is a core surface attribute.",
      "question": "Does the skateboard have a dark gray grip tape surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The silver trucks and tan wheels are standard components of a skateboard and are crucial for its mechanical identity. Their metallic and rubber materials are visually distinct and necessary for recognition. Replacing them with different colors or materials would compromise the skateboard’s authenticity. This is a 2-point weight because they are key structural elements.",
      "question": "Are the skateboard’s trucks silver and the wheels tan in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The vertical alignment and parallel positioning of the kayak and skateboard create a balanced, intentional composition. This spatial relationship is part of the original image’s design logic and must be preserved to maintain visual coherence. Disrupting this arrangement would break the symmetry and intent of the scene. This is a 2-point weight because it affects the overall scene structure.",
      "question": "Are the kayak and skateboard aligned vertically and placed parallel to each other?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The neutral beige background provides a clean, distraction-free setting that highlights the two main objects. Any significant change in color or texture would alter the mood and focus of the image. While the Polaroid frame may overlay this background, the underlying surface should retain its original appearance. This is a 1-point weight because it is a secondary environmental detail.",
      "question": "Is the background a uniform neutral beige surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "thinking_process": "The soft shadows cast to the left of both objects indicate consistent lighting and depth. Preserving shadow direction and softness maintains the three-dimensional quality and realism of the scene. Altering shadows could imply a different light source or time of day, disrupting visual continuity. This is a 1-point weight because it supports spatial realism but is not a core identity feature.",
      "question": "Do both the kayak and skateboard cast soft shadows to their left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
