Description of reference image: The subject is a horse being led on a paved sidewalk outside a business establishment. The horse has a white marking on its nose and face, and it is saddled with a white saddle blanket featuring a logo, along with stirrups and other riding gear. The background includes storefronts with signage, glass windows, and a person partially visible leading the horse.

Thinking process: The instructions specify turning the skateboarder into a chibi cartoon character while keeping certain aspects like the jump pose, gray T-shirt, and shorts. The background is also specified for change to a hand-drawn city skyline. Since this scenario involves changing a horse into a cartoon skateboarder, the reference image's details do not align with the editing instructions. However, an analysis focusing on what should be retained if transforming a horse into a chibi skateboarder can proceed as per the guidelines.

Allowed Changes List:  
Specific element 1 that allows for changes: Transform the horse into a chibi cartoon character.  
Specific element 2 that allows for changes: Change the background to a hand-drawn city skyline.  

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements: The skateboarding action, the chibi style, and the chibi character's outfit (gray T-shirt and shorts) are critical for recognizability in the transformed image.  
Functional/logical association elements: Maintaining the skateboarding pose ensures the functional aspect of the action is intact, while the character's attire ties logically with the urban action theme.  
Non-modified element deduction: The presence of the skateboard and the character's oversized head are necessary visual coherence elements for chibi style transformation.

Preservation Targets List:  
(Element 1 that should be maintained): The skateboarding pose.  
(Element 2 that should be maintained): Gray T-shirt and shorts.  
(Element 3 that should be maintained): Character's oversized head.  
(Element 4 that should be maintained): Simplified skateboard design.
