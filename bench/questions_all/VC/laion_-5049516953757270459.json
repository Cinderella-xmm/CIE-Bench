      "thinking_process": "The heart shape is the central symbolic and structural element of the image. The instruction explicitly requires keeping the heart shape intact, making it a core identity feature. If the shape is altered (e.g., oval or circular), the image loses its thematic meaning and visual coherence. Therefore, preserving the heart shape is critical for recognition.",
      "question": "Is the overall shape of the food arrangement a perfect heart?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The half-cut avocado is a distinctive feature that separates it from other round fruits. Its cut side facing up is a key visual identifier. If it were whole or positioned differently, it would be misidentified. Since the instruction mentions simulating textures, the cut must still be represented in LEGO form, so its presence and orientation must be preserved.",
      "question": "Is the avocado shown as half-cut with the pit cavity visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The tied bundle of asparagus is a unique detail indicating preparation and grouping. It is visually distinct due to the twine binding. Losing this would make the asparagus indistinguishable from loose stalks. Even in LEGO form, the binding must be represented to preserve this detail.",
      "question": "Are the asparagus stalks bundled together with a visible twine-like structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The cluster of berries (blueberries, strawberries, raspberries) at the top-left is a key compositional element. Their proximity and color contrast create a focal point. Changing their grouping or replacing any type (e.g., swapping raspberries for blackberries) would alter the visual balance and identity of the arrangement. Thus, their presence and grouping must be preserved.",
      "question": "Are blueberries, strawberries, and raspberries grouped together at the top-left of the heart?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The red onion is located next to the garlic and broccoli, forming a vegetable cluster. Its deep purple color and spherical shape are distinctive. Replacing it with another bulb (e.g., shallot) or moving it would disrupt the intended grouping and visual logic. Therefore, its presence and position are important.",
      "question": "Is there a single red onion positioned near the broccoli and garlic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The bundle of white mushrooms is centrally located and includes both small and larger caps. Their number and clustering are part of the food diversity theme. Reducing or increasing their count would affect the balance. Since the instruction specifies structuring each item with borders, their quantity and grouping must be preserved.",
      "question": "Are there at least three white mushrooms grouped together near the center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The large red bell pepper is a prominent element at the bottom-right. Its size and color contrast make it stand out. Moving it or replacing it with a green pepper would alter the visual hierarchy. Its presence is necessary for completing the vegetable section.",
      "question": "Is there a large red bell pepper at the bottom-right of the heart?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q8",
      "thinking_process": "The wooden background is replaced by a neutral gray base according to instructions. However, the **original wooden planks** are not required to be preserved. Therefore, this is not a retention target. But the **gray base** becomes the new scene element. Since the instruction specifies the new base, we do not need to assess the original background.",
      "question": "Is the background a neutral gray surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
