**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is an ornate, silver-colored teapot with a highly detailed Baroque-style design, featuring intricate floral and scrollwork engravings across its body, lid, spout, and base. The teapot has a curved wooden handle attached to the side via ornamental metal fittings, a long, elegantly shaped spout, and a domed lid topped with a small finial. The surface exhibits a reflective metallic texture with polished highlights, emphasizing depth and craftsmanship. The teapot stands on a three-legged pedestal base with decorative feet. It rests on a dark, polished wooden table that reflects its silhouette, creating a mirror-like effect. The background is dimly lit and blurred, suggesting a classic or vintage interior setting with soft ambient lighting that accentuates the metallic sheen of the teapot.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction specifies transforming the teapot into a luxury candle design while using the teapot as the glass base. This indicates that the **form** of the object will be reinterpreted—specifically, the teapot's structure will be repurposed into a candle holder—but not necessarily preserved in its original functional identity. Key changes are explicitly stated:  
- The **metallic texture** must be translated into a **high-gloss ceramic finish** → change in material appearance allowed.  
- The **spout** is to be replaced with a **wick** → structural modification permitted.  
- The **handle** is to become a **decorative gold accent** → form and material change allowed.  
- A **subtle floral pattern** is to be added around the base → new element introduced.  
- The name **"Eternal Elegance Candle"** in elegant script is to be added at the front → text overlay added.  

The scene environment (wooden table, reflection, dark background) is not mentioned for retention or change, so it may be altered unless implied by continuity. However, since no explicit instruction to change the scene is given, we assume only the subject is modified, and the scene can remain if logically consistent.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
- Spout → replaced with wick  
- Handle → transformed into decorative gold accent  
- Metallic texture → changed to high-gloss ceramic finish  
- Addition of subtle floral pattern around base  
- Addition of text "Eternal Elegance Candle" in elegant script  
- Material transformation from metal to ceramic (visual texture change)  
- Functional transformation from teapot to candle

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
We now identify elements that **must be retained** despite the transformation, based on core recognition, functional logic, and visual coherence:

1. **Core recognition elements**: The teapot’s **distinctive ornamental style**—especially the **Baroque-inspired scrollwork and floral engraving patterns**—is central to its identity. Even though it becomes a candle, the *design language* must remain recognizable to preserve the aesthetic origin. These patterns are not just decoration; they define the object’s cultural and artistic lineage.

2. **Functional/logical association elements**: While the function changes, the **overall silhouette and proportion** of the teapot (e.g., the curve of the body, the placement of the spout and handle relative to the body) should be preserved to maintain the visual identity of the original form. If the shape is radically distorted, the connection to the original teapot is lost.

3. **Non-modified element deduction**: Since the instructions do not mention changing the **base**, **lid**, or **finial**, these structural components should remain visually identifiable, even if materials or textures shift. The **three-legged pedestal** and **domed lid with finial** are signature features of this specific teapot design and must be retained in form to ensure continuity.

4. **Scene consistency**: The **polished wooden surface** and **reflection** are part of the original composition. Although not explicitly required, their retention supports visual coherence. If the scene were drastically changed (e.g., floating in space), it would break continuity. However, since no instruction mandates scene alteration, and reflections help ground the object, they are implicitly preserved.

5. **Material transformation vs. form preservation**: The instruction allows changing the texture (metal → ceramic), but **not the form**. Therefore, the **shape of the body, the curvature of the spout, the position of the handle**, etc., must remain intact.

6. **Critical details**: The **presence of the lid**, **the finial on top**, and **the ornate metal fittings connecting the handle** are all unique identifiers. Even if converted to ceramic, their **positions and shapes** must remain consistent.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
- The overall silhouette and proportions of the teapot  
- The location and shape of the lid with its finial  
- The presence and position of the three-legged pedestal base  
- The ornate scrollwork and floral engraving patterns on the body, lid, and spout  
- The curve and attachment point of the handle (even if transformed into a gold accent)  
- The reflective surface of the wooden table and the teapot’s reflection  
- The positioning of the spout relative to the body (though it becomes a wick, its location must match)

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Retained Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The ornate scrollwork and floral engraving patterns are the defining artistic feature of the teapot, distinguishing it from other vessels. These intricate designs are essential to its identity as a Baroque-style artifact. If removed or simplified, the object loses its visual essence and cannot be recognized as derived from the original. Thus, preserving the exact pattern layout and density is critical for identification.
    Question: Is the complex scrollwork and floral engraving pattern visible on the body, lid, and spout of the object?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The lid with its domed shape and finial is a core structural identifier. Its absence or replacement with a flat cap would fundamentally alter the object’s identity. Even if made of ceramic, the lid must retain its original shape and placement to maintain continuity with the source image.
    Question: Does the object have a domed lid topped with a small finial at the apex?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The three-legged pedestal base is a unique structural feature that defines the teapot’s stability and aesthetic balance. Removing or altering its shape would disrupt the object’s proportional harmony and make it unrecognizable as the original piece.
    Question: Is the object supported by a three-legged pedestal base with decorative feet?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The handle’s curve and its attachment point to the body are distinctive. Even though it is to be transformed into a gold accent, its original position and arc must be preserved to maintain spatial consistency. Changing its location would distort the object’s balance and break visual logic.
    Question: Is there a curved handle attached to the left side of the object, extending upward and backward?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The spout’s elongated, curved shape is a key functional and aesthetic component. Although it is to be replaced with a wick, its position and orientation must remain unchanged to preserve the object’s silhouette. Moving or shortening it would alter the overall form and break continuity.
    Question: Is there a long, curved spout extending from the right side of the object’s body?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The reflective wooden surface and the clear reflection of the object are integral to the original composition. They provide depth and context. Removing the reflection or changing the surface would disconnect the object from its environment and reduce visual fidelity.
    Question: Is the object placed on a polished wooden surface with a clear reflection visible beneath it?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}
{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The ornamental metal fittings connecting the handle to the body are minor but distinctive details that add to the craftsmanship. Their presence contributes to the authenticity of the original design. While less critical than major forms, their loss would reduce visual coherence.
    Question: Are there decorative metal fittings where the handle attaches to the body?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
