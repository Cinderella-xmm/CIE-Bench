Description of reference image: The subject is a white horse in motion, positioned diagonally across the image. Its coat is predominantly white with blonde highlights on the mane and tail. The horse appears to be mid-gait, giving a sense of movement. The background is an open grassland under a clear sky, with soft green tones and blurred distant tree lines.

Allowed Changes List:
Specific element 1 that allows for changes
(Grassland background can be replaced with a forest setting.)
(Specific elements allowed for change 2)
(Sunlight streaming through the trees can be added for a mystical atmosphere.)
(Specific elements allowed for change 3)
(The horse can appear to leap from the shadows.)

Step 2 - Determine the elements that should remain unchanged

Thinking process:
- Core recognition elements: The white horseâ€™s distinctive features, such as its white coat, blonde mane, and tail, are crucial for recognizing the subject as a white horse. These features must be retained to maintain the animal's identity.
- Functional/logical association elements: The horse's posture, showing it in mid-gait, is essential to convey the impression of motion and grace. Changing this would disrupt the logical flow of the image.
- Remaining elements: The horse's distinct hooves and natural body proportions should stay consistent to ensure visual coherence.

Preservation Targets List:
(The horse's white coat and blonde mane/tail)
(The horse's mid-gait posture)
(The horse's distinctive hooves)
(The horse's natural body proportions)
