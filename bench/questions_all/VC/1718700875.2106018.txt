Description of reference image:  
The subject is a white poodle with a meticulously groomed, voluminous coat styled in a classic poodle cut, featuring a rounded head shape and fluffy, curly tufts around the ears and face. The dog's fur is predominantly pure white, with soft, cloud-like textures and subtle shading that highlights its three-dimensional form. Its eyes are dark brown, expressive, and slightly downward-angled, conveying a calm and dignified demeanor. The nose is black and well-defined, with fine grayish fur around the muzzle. The dog is dressed in an elaborate pastel-colored gown reminiscent of 18th-century Rococo fashion—specifically inspired by Marie Antoinette’s attire. The dress features light blue and pale pink tones, adorned with intricate lace patterns, silver embroidery, and large ruffled tulle sleeves on both sides. A prominent decorative brooch made of silver filigree and beadwork is centered on the chest area. The background consists of a muted, ornate baroque-style wall pattern with gold scrollwork and floral motifs on a dusty blue-gray surface, contributing to the opulent and historical ambiance. The lighting is soft and diffused, casting gentle shadows that enhance the texture of the fur and fabric.

Thinking process:  
First, analyze the editing instructions word by word:  
- "Design an intricately detailed 3D figurine inspired by Marie Antoinette's attire in the image" → This indicates the **subject** will be transformed into a **figurine**, meaning the original living animal form (the poodle) will no longer exist as such. However, the **attire** described must remain **inspired by** the original, implying that the clothing design should retain key visual traits.  
- "Focusing on her elaborate, pastel dress and ornate accessories" → The **dress** and **accessories** are central to the transformation but must reflect the original’s style. Thus, the **design elements of the dress** (pastel colors, ruffles, lace, brooch) are not fully replaceable; they must be preserved in essence.  
- "Render the figurine in a lace-textured finish, accentuating ruffled details" → The **texture** of the dress changes from fabric to lace-like material, but **ruffled details** must still be present. So, **ruffles** are retained, but their **material** may change.  
- "Mount it on a polished wooden base with gilded scrollwork" → The **base** is new and not in the original image; this is a complete addition.  
- "Place this within a baroque-style display case adorned with luscious floral motifs, echoing the lavish rococo backdrop" → The **background** is replaced entirely with a display case. The **original baroque wall pattern** is now part of a new setting, so it may be echoed but not necessarily preserved directly.

Allowed Changes List:  
- Subject form: From live poodle to 3D figurine (complete transformation allowed)  
- Dress material: From fabric to lace-textured finish (allowed change)  
- Background: Original baroque wall replaced with display case (allowed change)  
- Base: Added polished wooden base with gilded scrollwork (new element, allowed)  
- Display case: New structure, allowed  
- Lighting: May be adjusted for 3D rendering (allowed)

Step 2– Determine the elements that should remain unchanged  
Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements:  
- The **poodle’s facial features** (especially the eye color, nose shape, and expression) are essential to identifying the subject as a specific breed and individual. Even though the form becomes a figurine, the **identity of the poodle** must be preserved through these features.  
- The **dress design** is explicitly referenced as “inspired by Marie Antoinette’s attire,” so its **iconic elements**—such as **pastel color palette**, **large ruffled sleeves**, **silver brooch**, and **lace detailing**—must be retained in form even if texture changes. These are core to the visual identity of the subject in this context.  
- The **overall pose and orientation** (side profile, head turned slightly forward) is important for maintaining continuity with the original composition.  

Functional/logical association elements:  
- The **relationship between the poodle and the dress** must remain intact—i.e., the dress must still be worn by the figurine in a way that mimics the original positioning. Changing this would break the logical connection between subject and costume.  
- The **placement of the brooch** on the chest must remain consistent, as it is a focal point of the attire.  

Non-modified element deduction:  
After excluding allowed changes (form, texture, background), the following must be retained:  
- **Color of the eyes** (dark brown)  
- **Shape and position of the nose** (black, oval, centered)  
- **Fur color and general grooming style** (white, curly, poodle cut)  
- **Ruffle structure on sleeves** (volume, layered, pink)  
- **Brooch location and design complexity** (central, ornate, silver)  
- **Pose** (side profile, head turned toward viewer)  

Preservation Targets List:  
- Dark brown eyes of the poodle  
- Black oval nose with gray fur around muzzle  
- White, curly fur in poodle-style grooming  
- Large pink ruffled sleeves on both sides of the dress  
- Central silver brooch with intricate filigree design  
- Side profile pose with head slightly turned forward  
- Pastel color scheme of the dress (light blue and pink)  

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Q1:  
Thinking process: The dark brown eyes are a core identification feature of the poodle in the original image. They provide contrast against the white fur and contribute significantly to the animal’s expression and species recognition. If the eye color were changed (e.g., to blue or green), the subject would lose its authentic appearance and become unrecognizable as the same poodle. This is a key visual identifier and thus carries high weight.  
Question: Are the eyes of the figurine dark brown in color?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The black oval nose is a distinctive anatomical feature of the poodle, especially in contrast to the white fur. It is positioned centrally on the face and is essential for facial recognition. Altering its shape or color would disrupt the identity of the subject. Therefore, it is a core recognition element.  
Question: Is the nose of the figurine black and oval-shaped?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The white, curly fur in the poodle cut is a defining characteristic of the breed and the grooming style in the image. The volume and shape of the head and ear tufts are iconic. Changing the fur color or removing the curls would fundamentally alter the subject’s identity. Thus, this is a core visual feature.  
Question: Does the figurine retain the white, curly fur in a poodle-style grooming pattern?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The large pink ruffled sleeves are a dominant visual component of the dress and directly tied to the Marie Antoinette-inspired aesthetic. Their presence and placement are critical to maintaining the thematic consistency of the attire. Removing or altering them would undermine the intended style. While texture may change, the form must remain.  
Question: Are there large, layered pink ruffles on both sides of the figurine’s dress?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The central silver brooch is a focal point of the dress and contributes to the ornate, aristocratic theme. Its intricate design and position on the chest are key to the visual narrative. Moving or simplifying it would diminish the authenticity of the attire. Thus, it is an important accessory element.  
Question: Is there a detailed silver brooch located at the center of the chest area of the dress?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The side profile pose with the head slightly turned forward is a compositional choice that defines the subject’s stance and gaze direction. This posture is essential for maintaining continuity with the original image and ensuring the figurine appears as a faithful representation. Changing the angle or orientation would affect the overall visual coherence.  
Question: Is the figurine in a side profile pose with the head turned slightly forward?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The pastel color scheme (light blue and pink) of the dress is integral to the Rococo-inspired aesthetic. While texture may shift to lace, the color palette must remain consistent to preserve the visual theme. A significant deviation in color would make the attire unrecognizable as inspired by Marie Antoinette’s style.  
Question: Does the dress maintain a pastel color scheme with light blue and pink hues?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1
