Description of reference image: The subject is an ornate, hanging Moroccan-style lantern suspended from a wooden ceiling beam by a metal chain. The lantern features a symmetrical, bulbous body with a domed top and tapered base, crafted from dark bronze or brass metal with intricate geometric and floral cut-out patterns. The central section consists of multiple segmented panels made of translucent glass or colored glass, each embedded with detailed filigree designs that allow warm light to pass through, casting elaborate shadow patterns on the surrounding white stucco walls and wooden ceiling. The light source within emits a soft golden glow, enhancing the luminosity of the patterns. The lantern is centrally positioned in the frame, hanging slightly off-center from the ceiling's exposed wooden beams, which are dark brown and weathered, forming a rustic architectural framework. The wall surface is textured with uneven plaster, giving it a hand-finished appearance. The shadows cast by the lantern’s patterned design create a complex interplay of light and dark on the wall and ceiling, forming a radial, star-like projection directly above.

Thinking process:  
First, analyze the editing instructions: "Transform the ornate lantern into a mythical, luminescent jellyfish..." — this explicitly changes the **subject form**, meaning the physical structure and identity of the lantern can be altered. The instruction specifies replacing the metal framing with iridescent tendrils, glass panels with a translucent bell, and patterns with bioluminescent swirls — all indicating that the **core visual form** of the lantern is no longer required. However, the instruction does not mention altering the **scene environment** (e.g., the ceiling, walls, or lighting context), nor does it specify changing the position or spatial relationship of the object within the space. Thus, while the **subject** is transformed, the **background elements** such as the wooden beams, white plastered walls, and ambient lighting conditions may still need to be preserved unless otherwise stated.

Allowed Changes List:  
- The shape and material of the lantern (metal → iridescent tendrils)  
- The internal structure (glass panels → translucent bell)  
- The decorative patterns (geometric/floral → swirling bioluminescent designs)  
- The overall identity of the object (lantern → jellyfish)  
- The color scheme of the subject (warm gold → iridescent glow)  
- The light emission properties (static glow → dynamic bioluminescence)  
- The setting (from indoor architectural space → underwater realm)

Step 2 – Determine the elements that should remain unchanged  
Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements: The original image contains specific architectural and environmental details that define its identity. While the lantern itself is being replaced, the scene's structural components are not mentioned for transformation. Therefore, any **non-subject elements** not referenced in the editing instruction must be retained to preserve contextual coherence. The key identifying features of the original scene include the **exposed wooden ceiling beams**, the **white textured stucco walls**, and the **shadow projection pattern** created by the lantern. These elements are not part of the subject being transformed and are not instructed to change, so they must remain intact.

Functional/logical association elements: The lantern hangs from the ceiling via a chain; this **spatial relationship** (hanging from the beam) must be preserved if the new jellyfish is to float in the same location. Even though the subject changes, the **position and orientation** relative to the ceiling and walls are logically tied to the scene’s realism. If the jellyfish were placed arbitrarily without regard to the beam’s position, it would break the continuity of the environment.

Non-modified element deduction: After excluding the allowed changes (the lantern’s form, materials, patterns, and light behavior), the remaining visible elements — such as the **wooden beam structure**, **wall texture**, **ceiling planks**, and **shadow geometry** — must be retained. These are not described as modifiable and are essential to maintaining the original spatial logic and visual consistency.

Preservation Targets List:  
- The presence and position of the exposed wooden ceiling beams  
- The white, textured stucco wall surface  
- The shadow pattern projected onto the ceiling and wall  
- The spatial layout of the room corner where the wall meets the ceiling  
- The direction and angle of light casting shadows  

Q1:  
Thinking process: The wooden ceiling beams are a core architectural feature of the original image, defining the structural context. Their presence, number, spacing, and dark brown weathered texture are distinctive and contribute to the rustic aesthetic. Changing their shape, color, or removing them entirely would fundamentally alter the scene’s identity. Since the instruction does not mention modifying the ceiling, these beams must be preserved. This is a key structural element with high visual weight.  
Question: Are the two visible dark brown wooden ceiling beams, one running diagonally and one vertically, present and positioned as in the original image?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3

Q2:  
Thinking process: The white textured stucco wall is a defining background element that contrasts with the lantern’s warm glow. Its rough, uneven surface is a key detail contributing to the ambiance. Since the instruction does not specify changing the wall, and the jellyfish would appear in the same space, the wall texture must remain unchanged to maintain environmental authenticity. This is a major scene element affecting visual coherence.  
Question: Is the white, hand-textured stucco wall visible on the left side of the image, showing irregular surface imperfections and subtle brushwork marks?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3

Q3:  
Thinking process: The shadow pattern projected by the lantern onto the ceiling and wall is a critical visual consequence of the original lighting setup. It forms a radial, star-like design due to the lantern’s cut-outs. Although the lantern is being replaced, the instruction implies the same light source effect but in a different form. However, since the scene is not explicitly changed to underwater, the **original shadow pattern** must be preserved unless redefined. But note: the instruction says “make it float gracefully in an ethereal underwater realm,” which suggests a full scene change. However, since the original scene is not mentioned as changed, we assume the **shadow pattern** must still be consistent with the original lighting direction and intensity. This is a key lighting interaction element.  
Question: Is the shadow pattern on the ceiling and wall composed of a radial, star-shaped lattice formed by the lantern’s cut-out design, matching the exact geometric configuration of the lantern’s panels?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3

Q4:  
Thinking process: The corner junction between the wall and ceiling defines the spatial depth and perspective of the image. It is a fixed architectural feature that anchors the composition. Since the instruction does not mention altering the room structure, this corner must remain unchanged to preserve spatial logic. This is a secondary but important structural detail.  
Question: Is the corner where the white wall meets the wooden ceiling clearly visible, forming a sharp right-angle edge at the upper left portion of the image?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2

Q5:  
Thinking process: The chain connecting the lantern to the ceiling is a functional and visual link between the object and its support. Although the lantern is being transformed, the chain’s presence and attachment point are necessary to maintain the illusion of suspension. If removed, the jellyfish might appear to float without cause. Since the instruction doesn’t mention changing the suspension mechanism, it should be preserved. This is a minor but logical detail.  
Question: Is the metal chain, consisting of small linked rings, visibly connecting the top of the lantern to the ceiling fixture?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1

Q6:  
Thinking process: The light source within the lantern creates a warm, focused glow that illuminates the interior and casts light through the cut-outs. Although the new jellyfish will emit bioluminescence, the original light source’s **direction and intensity** must be consistent with the existing shadow pattern. The light must originate from within the object and project outward in the same way. This is a functional lighting element tied to the scene’s realism.  
Question: Does the light emanate from within the central chamber of the lantern, creating a bright focal point that radiates outward through the perforated panels?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2
