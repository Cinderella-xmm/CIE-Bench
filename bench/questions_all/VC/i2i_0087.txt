Description of reference image: The subject is a minimalist wall-mounted clock positioned centrally against a solid, turquoise-colored background. The clock has a white circular face with a clean design. It features two black hands (hour and minute) and a thin red second hand, with a small orange pivot point at the center. There are no numbers, markings, or additional embellishments on the clock face.

### Step 1 - Allowed Changes List:
- The depth and perspective of the clock can be adjusted to create a three-dimensional protrusion effect.
- Shadows and lighting effects can be added around the clock to enhance the three-dimensional appearance.
- The spatial relationship between the clock and the wall may be altered slightly to support the illusion of projection.

### Step 2 - Preservation Targets List:
#### Thinking Process:
- Core Recognition Elements: The clock’s simplistic design, including the white face, the arrangement of the black hour and minute hands, and the red second hand, are integral to the clock's identity. Changing these would alter its core recognition as a minimalist clock.
- Functional/Logical Association Elements: The relative positions of the clock hands, indicating time, must remain consistent with a real-world clock's functionality.
- Remaining Visual Coherence Elements: The turquoise background and the absence of numbers/markings on the clock face contribute to visual coherence and should be retained to preserve the minimalist aesthetic.

#### Preservation Targets List:
- White clock face
- Black hour and minute hands
- Red second hand
- Orange pivot point
- Absence of numbers/markings on the clock face
- Turquoise background
