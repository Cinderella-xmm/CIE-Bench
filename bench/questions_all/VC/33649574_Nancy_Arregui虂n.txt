**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a rooster standing on an asphalt surface, facing slightly to the left with its head turned toward the viewer. The rooster has a bright red comb and wattles, a golden-orange neck and breast feathers transitioning into reddish-brown body plumage, and a black tail with curved, layered feathers. Its legs are pale gray with visible claws, and it stands in a natural, alert posture. The background consists of dark gray asphalt scattered with small bits of debris, such as dried leaves, twigs, and yellow plant fragments. The lighting is diffuse, suggesting overcast conditions, and the ground appears slightly damp, reflecting subtle light.

Thinking process:  
The editing instruction explicitly transforms the rooster into a phoenix-like creature by altering its appearance through fantastical elements:  
- Feathers are to be given iridescent, fiery hues with shimmering gradients (modifies color and texture of feathers).  
- Tail is to be replaced with extravagant plumes transitioning into smoke-like tendrils (replaces tail structure entirely).  
- Molten gold accents are to be added along wings and head crest (adds new material/texture to existing parts).  
- Eyes are to resemble flickering flames (changes eye appearance).  
- Ancient rune patterns are to be added to talons (modifies claw details).  

These changes target the **subject’s form, coloration, and appendages**, but do **not mention altering the scene or environment**. The instruction does not say “replace the background” or “change the setting,” so the **asphalt surface and scattered debris remain part of the required context** unless explicitly overridden. However, since no instruction specifies retaining the environment, we must assess whether it's implied to stay. Given that the transformation is applied *to* the rooster while leaving no mention of the surroundings, the **scene remains unchanged unless modified for visual coherence**—but since no guidance is given, we assume the **environment should be preserved** for consistency unless the edit inherently alters it.

Allowed Changes List:  
(Specific element 1 that allows for changes): The feather coloration and texture (including iridescent, fiery gradients)  
(Specific element 2 that allows for changes): The tail structure (replaced with trailing plumes and smoke tendrils)  
(Specific element 3 that allows for changes): The eyes (transformed into flickering flame-like shapes)  
(Specific element 4 that allows for changes): The addition of molten gold accents on wings and crest  
(Specific element 5 that allows for changes): The addition of ancient rune patterns on talons  
(Specific element 6 that allows for changes): The overall fantasy aesthetic applied to the rooster’s form

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements:  
- The **rooster’s identity** is based on its biological features: the **red comb and wattles**, **beak shape**, **body proportions**, and **natural feather pattern**. While the instructions allow changing colors and textures, they do not remove the **basic anatomical structure** of a rooster. Therefore, **the presence of a rooster-shaped bird with a distinct head, neck, body, and legs** must remain recognizable.  
- The **head crest (comb)** is iconic—its **shape and position** (on top of the head, upright and serrated) are essential for identifying the subject as a rooster. Even if made fiery or metallic, its **form and placement** should not be lost.  
- The **beak** is a key feature—its **color (dark), shape (pointed), and position** must remain consistent with a real rooster.  
- The **legs and feet** are critical: their **structure, number of toes, and positioning** must remain intact even if runes are added.  

Functional/logical association elements:  
- The **rooster’s stance** (standing on two legs, one foot slightly forward) is functional—it suggests movement and balance. This posture should be retained for logical consistency, even if stylized.  
- The **ground interaction**: the rooster is standing on asphalt, and its feet make contact with the surface. This physical relationship must remain valid; otherwise, the edited image would appear disconnected from reality.  

Non-modified element deduction:  
- The **background** (asphalt surface with scattered debris) is not mentioned for modification. Since the transformation is applied to the rooster, and no instruction says to change the environment, the **original background elements** (e.g., texture of asphalt, scattered leaves, moisture patches) must be retained to preserve visual context and grounding.  
- The **overall composition**: the rooster is centered in the frame, viewed from a slightly low angle. This framing supports the subject’s dominance and should be maintained unless explicitly altered.  

Preservation Targets List:  
(The rooster’s head shape and position relative to the body)  
(The presence and location of the red comb and wattles)  
(The beak’s shape and placement)  
(The leg structure and foot positioning on the ground)  
(The asphalt surface with scattered debris)  
(The rooster’s general silhouette and posture)

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

Q1:  
Thinking process: The **red comb** is a core identification feature of a rooster. Its **bright red color**, **serrated shape**, and **position on top of the head** are unmistakable markers. Even if transformed into a fiery or iridescent version, the **presence and location** of this comb must be preserved to maintain the subject’s identity. Losing it would result in a non-rooster creature, undermining recognition. This is a 3-point element due to its role in species identification.  
Question: Is the rooster’s comb present on top of its head in a prominent, upright position?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The **wattles** beneath the beak are another key anatomical feature of roosters. They are **red**, **fleshy**, and located directly below the beak. Their presence confirms the subject as a rooster. Even if stylized, their **location and form** must remain identifiable. Removing them would misrepresent the animal. This is a 3-point element due to its diagnostic value.  
Question: Are the red fleshy wattles visible under the rooster’s beak?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The **beak** is a functional and identifying feature. It is **dark-colored**, **pointed**, and attached to the front of the face. Its shape and position are essential for distinguishing a rooster from other birds. Even if glowing or enhanced, its **basic form and placement** must remain. Altering it significantly could break the link to the original subject. This is a 3-point element.  
Question: Is the rooster’s beak clearly visible and positioned at the front of the face, with a pointed tip?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The **legs and feet** are crucial for grounding the subject in reality. The rooster stands on two legs with three forward-facing toes and one backward toe. This structure is necessary for balance and movement. Even if runes are added, the **number and arrangement of toes** must remain accurate. Changing this would affect the biological plausibility. This is a 2-point element due to its importance in posture and function.  
Question: Does the rooster have two legs with three forward-facing toes and one rear toe on each foot?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The **asphalt surface** with scattered debris (leaves, twigs, moisture spots) provides environmental context. The rooster is standing on it, and this interaction is essential for scene coherence. If the background were replaced or heavily altered, the edited image would lose its original setting. Since no instruction says to change the background, it must be preserved. This is a 2-point element because it defines the scene and anchors the subject.  
Question: Is the rooster standing on a dark gray asphalt surface with visible debris such as leaves and small plant fragments?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The **posture** of the rooster—standing upright, head raised, one foot slightly forward—is a key detail indicating alertness and natural behavior. This stance is part of the original composition and helps convey the subject’s character. Even if stylized, the **overall orientation and balance** must be maintained. This is a 1-point element as it supports visual consistency but is less critical than anatomy.  
Question: Is the rooster standing upright with its head raised and one foot slightly forward?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The **tail feathers** are being replaced with smoke-like plumes, but the **original tail structure** must still be referenced in the transformation. The tail is located at the back, curved upward, and composed of layered black feathers. Even if transformed, the **placement and general shape** of the tail must remain consistent with the original. This ensures continuity in the subject’s silhouette. This is a 2-point element due to its role in form and balance.  
Question: Is the tail positioned at the rear of the rooster’s body and extending upward in a curved shape?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q8:  
Thinking process: The **feather pattern** on the neck and chest—golden-orange with fine striations—is a distinctive visual trait. While colors may shift to iridescent tones, the **direction and layering of feathers** must remain consistent. This maintains the rooster’s realistic base before transformation. This is a 1-point element as it supports texture realism.  
Question: Are the neck and chest feathers arranged in overlapping layers with a golden-orange hue?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1
