      "thinking_process": "The circular shape of the tabletop is the most fundamental identifying feature of the original table. It defines the object's primary form and distinguishes it from other types of furniture. Even if transformed into a gear, the circle must remain intact to preserve the original identity. Losing this shape would make the object unrecognizable as a derivation of the original table. This is a core identity element, so it receives a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the tabletop still circular in shape?",

      "thinking_process": "The central vertical column is a key structural component that connects the tabletop to the base. Its presence maintains the functional logic of a table — a top supported by a central post. Even if modified with steam vents or mechanical parts, the column must remain vertically aligned and singular to preserve the original design's integrity. Changing its number or orientation would disrupt the logical support system. This is a critical functional element, hence a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Does a single vertical column extend from the center of the tabletop to the base?",

      "thinking_process": "The five-pointed star-shaped base is a distinctive design feature of the original table. It provides both stability and aesthetic symmetry. Even if transformed into articulated limbs, the base must retain its five-legged radial structure to maintain visual continuity. Altering the number of legs or removing the star pattern would sever the connection to the original object. This is an important structural identifier, thus receiving a weight of 2 points.",
      "question": "Does the base consist of five symmetrically arranged legs forming a star shape?",

      "thinking_process": "The rubber feet at the end of each leg are minor but identifiable details that prevent slipping and protect surfaces. While not core to identity, they are consistent across the original image and contribute to the realism and completeness of the object. Their absence would suggest incomplete transformation or loss of detail. As a secondary detail, it receives a weight of 1 point.",
      "question": "Are there small black rubber feet at the tip of each leg?",

      "thinking_process": "The overall height and proportion of the table — specifically the ratio between the tabletop diameter and the column length — define its scale and usability. Even if mechanical components are added, the relative size of the parts must remain consistent to avoid distorting the original form. This proportionality ensures the transformed object remains visually coherent with the source. It is a structural consistency factor, thus assigned 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the height of the central column approximately equal to the diameter of the tabletop?",

      "thinking_process": "The metallic silver color and reflective surface are defining characteristics of the material used in the original table. While the editing instruction allows for brass and copper accents, the base material must remain visually consistent with stainless steel or similar silver-toned metal. If the entire object were recolored into bronze or gold without retaining any silver elements, it would lose its original material identity. This is a key visual attribute tied to recognition, so it receives a weight of 2 points.",
