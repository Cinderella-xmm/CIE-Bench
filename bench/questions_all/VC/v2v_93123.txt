### Step 1 - Description of Reference Image and Allowed Changes List:

**Description of Reference Image:**  
The subject is an elderly man with white hair and a mustache, gazing contemplatively at a pineapple placed in front of him. He is positioned on the left side of the image, facing right. The pineapple is prominently displayed on the right, with its spiky green leaves and textured golden-brown skin. Both the man and the pineapple are illuminated by a soft, warm light against a diffuse, smoky brown background. The lighting highlights their textures and creates a serene, reflective atmosphere.

**Thinking Process:**  
The editing instructions specify replacing the background while retaining the soft, warm illumination on the subjects. This means the background can be changed entirely, but the lighting conditions on the man and pineapple must stay consistent. The subjects themselves—appearance, posture, and positioning—cannot be altered.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
1. The diffuse, smoky brown background can be replaced with an aged blackboard filled with equations and sketches.
2. The color tone and light/shadow intensity can be adjusted to match the new background while keeping the warm illumination on the subjects.

### Step 2 - Determination of Elements That Should Remain Unchanged:

**Thinking Process:**  
- **Core Recognition Elements:** The elderly man’s appearance (white hair, mustache, facial expression), the pineapple’s distinctive shape and texture, and their relative positions must remain unchanged. These are essential for recognizing the subjects.
- **Functional/Logical Association Elements:** The man’s gaze directed toward the pineapple must be preserved to maintain the contemplative interaction between them.
- **Remaining Elements:** The warm lighting and shadows on the subjects should be retained to preserve the mood and visual coherence.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
1. The elderly man’s appearance (white hair, mustache, facial expression).
2. The pineapple’s shape and texture.
3. The man’s gaze directed toward the pineapple.
4. The warm lighting and shadows on the subjects.
