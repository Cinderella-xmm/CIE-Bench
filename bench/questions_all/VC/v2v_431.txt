Description of reference image: The subject consists of six distinct ornamental keys arranged in two rows of three on a dark wooden surface with visible grain patterns. Each key has a unique head design and metallic finish, differing in shape, texture, and symbolic motifs. From top left to bottom right:  
1. A golden key with a circular head featuring an intricate five-pointed star (pentagram) within a ring.  
2. A silver-gray key with a triangular head containing a symmetrical geometric pattern resembling a stylized trident or triquetra.  
3. A golden key with a circular head bearing the Eye of Horus symbol (a detailed eye with curved lines and a teardrop).  
4. A bronze-colored key with a floral-like scrollwork head composed of swirling curves and loops.  
5. A silver-gray key with a circular head displaying a Latin cross centered within a beaded border.  
6. A silver-gray key with a square head showcasing a Celtic knot pattern.  

All keys have elongated shafts ending in traditional bit ends with notches and teeth, consistent with antique-style skeleton keys. The materials appear metallic—some with polished gold tones, others with matte or oxidized silver finishes. The background is a rich brown wooden plank surface with horizontal grain lines, knots, and subtle variations in tone, providing contrast and depth. The lighting casts soft shadows beneath each key, enhancing their three-dimensional form.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions word by word. The instruction states: "Convert the keys shown in the image into 3D cartoon-style chibi renditions while preserving their distinctive shapes and designs." This indicates that the **form** of the keys can be transformed into a chibi/cartoon style, but their **distinctive shapes and designs** must be preserved. Therefore, the **core symbolic motifs** (e.g., pentagram, Eye of Horus, cross, Celtic knot) are allowed to remain recognizable even if stylized. The phrase “preserving their distinctive shapes and designs” implies that the **overall silhouette and iconography** of each key’s head must be retained, though rendered in a new artistic style.

Next, the instruction says: "Incorporate a Chinese festive theme by using red and gold hues in the patterns and details to evoke celebration and good fortune." This means color palette changes are permitted—specifically shifting toward red and gold—but only as part of the thematic overlay. However, this does **not** imply that original symbolic elements should be replaced; rather, they may be reinterpreted in those colors.

Then: "Modify the texture to resemble polished, ornamental accessories" — this allows for texture transformation (e.g., from metallic to glossy, smooth, or decorative), but again, it must still reflect the **original design intent**.

Finally: "Place them against a backdrop featuring a subtle '囍' (double happiness) paper-cut design" — this explicitly replaces the original wooden background. Thus, the **wooden surface is no longer required** and can be changed.

Allowed Changes List:
- The overall visual style of the keys (from realistic metal to 3D cartoon chibi)
- The texture of the keys (from metallic to polished, ornamental)
- The color scheme (to include red and gold hues)
- The background (replaced with a "囍" paper-cut design)
- The rendering technique (from photorealistic to stylized 3D animation)

Step 2 - Determine the elements that should remain unchanged

Thinking process:
Core recognition elements: The identity of each key hinges on its **unique head design**, which includes specific symbolic motifs. These are not arbitrary decorations but iconic symbols that define each key’s identity. For example:
- The **pentagram** in the top-left key is a distinct geometric figure with five points radiating from a central point.
- The **Eye of Horus** is a highly recognizable ancient Egyptian symbol with a defined eye shape, eyebrow, and teardrop.
- The **Latin cross** is a vertical bar with a shorter horizontal bar near the top.
- The **Celtic knot** is a continuous interlacing loop forming a square pattern.
- The **triangular geometric pattern** is a symmetrical abstract design resembling a trident or triquetra.
- The **floral scrollwork** is a curvilinear, symmetrical design with looping tendrils.

These are all **iconic identifiers**—if altered beyond recognition, the key would lose its identity. Since the instruction specifies "preserving their distinctive shapes and designs," these **must be retained in form**, even if stylized.

Functional/logical association elements: The keys are functional objects, and their **bit ends (the notched parts)** are essential for mechanical function. Even in a chibi or cartoon style, the **presence and basic structure of the bit end** must be preserved to maintain logical consistency with the object type. Removing or distorting the bit would make it unrecognizable as a key.

Non-modified element deduction: After excluding allowed changes (style, texture, color, background), the remaining **unmentioned structural features** must be preserved. These include:
- The **relative positions** of the keys (top row: left, center, right; bottom row: left, center, right)
- The **number of keys** (six total)
- The **orientation** of each key (all upright, shaft pointing down)
- The **proportional relationship** between head and shaft
- The **distinctiveness of each head design** (no merging or swapping of symbols)

Preservation Targets List:
- The pentagram motif in the top-left key's head
- The Eye of Horus symbol in the top-right key's head
- The Latin cross in the bottom-center key's head
- The Celtic knot in the bottom-right key's head
- The triangular geometric pattern in the top-center key's head
- The floral scrollwork in the bottom-left key's head
- The presence and shape of the bit end on each key
- The number and arrangement of the keys (six in a 2x3 grid)
- The orientation of each key (shaft downward)
- The relative size and proportion of head to shaft

Q1:  
Thinking process: The pentagram is the core identifying feature of the top-left key. It is a five-pointed star enclosed in a circle, with intersecting lines forming a symmetrical star shape. This is a unique and iconic symbol that defines the key’s identity. If this shape is lost or distorted beyond recognition (e.g., turned into a simple circle or star without internal lines), the key cannot be identified as the same object. Therefore, preserving the **presence and structure of the pentagram** is critical for identity retention. This is a 3-point element because it is a primary identifier of the key.

Question: Is the pentagram symbol (five-pointed star within a circular frame) present and structurally intact in the top-left key's head?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3

Q2:  
Thinking process: The Eye of Horus is a highly specific and culturally significant symbol. Its defining features include a stylized human eye with a curved upper lid, a prominent eyebrow, a teardrop-shaped extension below, and a line extending from the outer corner. This exact configuration is necessary to identify the symbol. Any simplification or abstraction that removes these components would destroy its identity. Since the instruction requires preserving "distinctive designs," this symbol must retain its core visual structure.

Question: Is the Eye of Horus symbol (with eye, eyebrow, teardrop, and side line) clearly depicted in the top-right key's head?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3

Q3:  
Thinking process: The Latin cross is a fundamental religious symbol with a vertical stem and a shorter horizontal bar near the top. This specific proportion and alignment distinguish it from other crosses (e.g., Greek or Celtic). In the context of the key, this cross is the defining feature of the bottom-center key. Altering its shape or proportions would misrepresent the key’s identity. As a core symbolic element, it must be preserved.

Question: Is the Latin cross (vertical bar with a shorter horizontal bar near the top) present in the center of the bottom-center key's head?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3

Q4:  
Thinking process: The Celtic knot is a continuous, interlaced pattern forming a square. It is characterized by flowing lines that weave over and under each other without beginning or end. This specific topology is essential to its identity. If the knot is simplified into a plain square or broken into separate lines, it loses its meaning and recognition. Since the instruction mandates preservation of "distinctive designs," this complex pattern must remain intact.

Question: Is the Celtic knot pattern (interlacing continuous lines forming a square) present in the bottom-right key's head?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3

Q5:  
Thinking process: The triangular geometric pattern in the top-center key is a symmetrical abstract design resembling a trident or triquetra. It consists of three interconnected arches forming a triangle. This is a unique shape not found in the other keys. Its preservation is necessary to distinguish this key from others. Even in a chibi style, the **basic triangular outline and internal symmetry** must be maintained.

Question: Is the triangular head with a symmetrical internal geometric pattern (three arches forming a trident-like shape) present in the top-center key?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3

Q6:  
Thinking process: The floral scrollwork in the bottom-left key is a curvilinear, symmetrical design with looping tendrils and swirls. This organic, decorative pattern is distinct from the other keys’ more geometric or symbolic designs. It serves as a key identifier for this particular key. While the style may change, the **presence of the swirling, symmetrical scroll pattern** must be preserved.

Question: Is the floral scrollwork (symmetrical curvilinear design with looping tendrils) present in the bottom-left key's head?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3

Q7:  
Thinking process: The bit end (the notched, toothed part at the bottom of each key) is a functional component that defines the object as a key. Even in a cartoon style, the **presence of a notched or toothed section** at the end of the shaft is essential for maintaining the object’s identity. Without it, the object becomes unrecognizable as a key. This is a functional/logical element that must be preserved.

Question: Does each key have a notched or toothed bit end at the bottom of its shaft?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3

Q8:  
Thinking process: The arrangement of the keys in a 2x3 grid is a spatial organization that contributes to the composition and identification of the scene. Changing the layout (e.g., rearranging or removing keys) would alter the visual narrative. Since the instruction does not mention changing the number or arrangement, and since the keys are presented as a set, the **number (six) and grid layout** must be preserved.

Question: Are there exactly six keys arranged in two rows of three on the surface?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2

Q9:  
Thinking process: The orientation of each key (shaft pointing downward) is consistent across all keys and contributes to the visual coherence of the image. Reversing or tilting any key would disrupt the uniformity and intended presentation. Although not a core identity feature, this alignment is important for maintaining the original composition and should be preserved.

Question: Are all six keys oriented with their shafts pointing downward?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
