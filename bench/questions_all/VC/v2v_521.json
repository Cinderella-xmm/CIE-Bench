      "thinking_process": "The cream-colored refrigerator with two horizontal chrome handles and a round dial on the upper door is a core recognition feature of the original image. This specific design is iconic of mid-century refrigerators and serves as a primary identifier of the era. If the shape, handle configuration, or dial is altered, the object would no longer be recognizable as the same model. The presence and position of the dial are particularly important because they distinguish this refrigerator from others. Therefore, this element is critical for maintaining the identity of the scene and must be preserved.",
