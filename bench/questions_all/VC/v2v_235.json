      "thinking_process": "The presence of short dark hair is a core identification feature of the dancer in the original image. While the chibi style may simplify the hairstyle, the fact that the dancer has short dark hair is a distinguishing trait that helps identify him as the same individual. Losing this feature could lead to misidentification, especially if the hair were made long or light-colored. Therefore, it is a key visual element that must be retained, even if stylized. This is a 2-point element because it is important for identity but not as critical as the pose itself.",

      "thinking_process": "The black sleeveless leotard is a defining piece of attire that contributes to the dancer’s identity and professional appearance. Although the material and texture may be altered in the chibi version, the garment’s shape and color must remain consistent to preserve the subject’s recognizable outfit. Changing it to a different color or style (e.g., shorts or tunic) would alter the dancer’s identity and break visual continuity. This is a 2-point element because it is a key accessory tied to the subject’s role and appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The specific ballet pose—right leg extended high, left leg supporting, right arm raised, left arm extended—is the central action of the image. The instruction emphasizes “frozen mid-pose” and requires the dancer to be in a dynamic form, so the spatial arrangement of limbs must be preserved. Reversing the leg positions or changing the arm angles would fundamentally alter the movement and make it unrecognizable as the same pose. This is a 3-point element because it is the core identity of the action and essential for maintaining the integrity of the original moment.",
      "question": "Is the dancer’s right leg extended upward while the left leg supports the body?",

        "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The direction of the gaze is a subtle but important detail that conveys focus and expression. In the original image, the dancer looks slightly to the left with a forward-facing profile. This orientation is part of the emotional and compositional balance of the pose. If the gaze were shifted dramatically or turned away, it would disrupt the sense of engagement and intention. Since the instruction mentions the dancer extending a hand toward the viewer, the facial orientation must align with that gesture. This is a 2-point element because it supports the narrative logic and maintains consistency in expression.",
      "question": "Is the dancer’s head turned slightly to the left, facing forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The extension of the left hand toward the viewer is explicitly required by the instruction (“illustrate the dancer extending their hand toward the viewer”). This gesture is not only a compositional choice but also a functional element that creates interaction with the audience. In the original image, the left arm is extended outward, and the hand is open with fingers splayed. This must be preserved in the chibi version to fulfill the narrative intent. Any deviation, such as a closed fist or backward extension, would violate the instruction and break the welcoming gesture. This is a 3-point element because it is directly tied to the purpose of the edited image and is a key functional component.",
      "question": "Is the dancer’s left hand extended forward toward the viewer with fingers splayed?",
      "choices": [

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The diagonal orientation of the body across the frame is a compositional feature that defines the dynamic energy of the pose. The dancer’s body forms a strong diagonal line from the lower left to the upper right, which is crucial for conveying motion and balance. Even in a chibi style, this spatial arrangement must be maintained to preserve the sense of movement and visual rhythm. Altering this alignment would distort the pose and make it appear static or unnatural. This is a 2-point element because it is essential for the overall structure of the image and affects how the pose is perceived.",
