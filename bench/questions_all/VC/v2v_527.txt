### Description of Reference Image:
The subject is a golden Labrador Retriever sitting atop a red octagonal stop sign. The dog has a light golden coat, floppy ears, and a happy expression with its tongue out. The stop sign is bright red with bold white lettering spelling "STOP." The background consists of a clear blue sky with a few scattered white clouds. The dog is positioned centrally above the stop sign, creating a playful and whimsical composition.

### Thinking Process:
The instructions clearly state transforming the dog and stop sign into LEGO-style figures while enclosing them in a transparent glass cube with a minimalist aesthetic. The vibrant blue sky and delicate clouds are to be represented through gradient shading. The base is described as a matte black surface with silver highlights, including a nameplate and engraved details. 

#### Allowed Changes List:
- The dog and stop sign are to be redesigned in LEGO minifigure style.
- The background is to be replaced with gradient shading representing the sky and clouds.
- The scene is to be enclosed in a transparent glass cube with a minimalist design.
- The base is to be a matte black surface with silver highlights, including a nameplate and engraved details.

### Thinking Process:
**Core Recognition Elements:** The golden Labrador Retriever's distinct features (color, posture, and expression) and the iconic shape and text of the stop sign are crucial for recognition. These elements must be preserved even in LEGO form.  
**Functional/Logical Association Elements:** The dog sitting atop the stop sign maintains a logical connection between the two elements, which should be retained.  
**Remaining Elements:** The blue sky and clouds contribute to the overall scene and should be represented through gradient shading as instructed.

### Preservation Targets List:
