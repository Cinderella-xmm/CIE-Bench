      "thinking_process": "The dark, glossy texture of the chocolate sauce is the most iconic visual feature of the dish, serving as the primary source of inspiration for the sneaker’s material design. Its deep brown color and high reflectivity are essential to conveying the \"decadent\" quality mentioned in the instruction. If this texture is lost or replaced with a matte or dull finish, the connection to the original dish breaks down, making the transformation unrecognizable. This is a core identity element, hence weighted at 3 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The flowing, pooling behavior of the chocolate sauce is a dynamic visual characteristic that defines how the sauce interacts with the cake and plate. This movement is critical to the dish’s aesthetic and must be translated into the sneaker’s design through cascading lines, layered materials, or sculpted forms. Losing this flow would remove the sense of liquidity and richness, undermining the conceptual link. This is a key design driver, thus weighted at 3 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The green, ruffled, organic shape of the lettuce is explicitly stated to inspire the \"fluid, natural contours\" of the sneaker. This shape is not just decorative but a structural guide for the sneaker’s silhouette. If the sneaker lacks any indication of wavy, undulating lines or natural curves derived from the lettuce, the inspiration is lost. This is a core design motif, so it is weighted at 3 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The reflective quality of the chocolate surface is a key detail that conveys its richness and viscosity. This shine is not just about color but about light interaction — it suggests a liquid, almost molten state. In the sneaker, this should be replicated through materials like patent leather, metallic finishes, or glossy coatings. Without this reflectivity, the chocolate’s visual identity is compromised. This is a secondary but important detail, so it is weighted at 2 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The contrast between the dark chocolate and the bright green lettuce is a fundamental compositional element that enhances the visual impact of the dish. This color contrast must be preserved in the sneaker design to maintain the original’s aesthetic balance. If the sneaker uses only dark tones or lacks a complementary green element, the visual harmony is broken. This is a key color relationship, so it is weighted at 2 points.",
