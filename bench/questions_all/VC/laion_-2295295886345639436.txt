Description of reference image: The subject is a highly muscular, stylized male figure depicted in a dynamic, aggressive pose with arms outstretched and head tilted back in a roar. The figure has an exaggerated physique with prominent pectoral, abdominal, and arm muscles, rendered in high contrast with strong black outlines and dark shading to emphasize form and definition. The character wears simple pants with a visible belt, and the lower body shows powerful thighs and calves, ending in bare feet with defined toes. The face is contorted in a fierce expression, mouth wide open in a yell, eyes narrowed, and facial features sharply defined. The overall style is illustrative and graphic, resembling comic book or action-figure art. The background is completely black, with no environmental details, focusing all attention on the central figure. The silhouette and posture suggest strength, dominance, and raw power.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions word by word:  
- "Create an infographic titled 'The Evolution of Strength through Time'" → implies a new layout and context, allowing full transformation of the scene and presentation format.  
- "Transforming the muscular character into different historical figures of strength" → indicates that the **form** of the character (clothing, equipment, role) will change across eras.  
- Specific transformations:  
  - Antiquity: Ancient Greek wrestler with mythological armor → changes attire and accessories  
  - Feudal Era: Knight with heavy plate armor and sword → changes clothing, weapon, and stance  
  - Modern Era: Olympic weightlifter with barbell → changes gear and posture  
- "Focus on intricate distinctions in attire and posture" → confirms that **attire and posture** are variable.  
- "While ensuring the head remains consistent" → explicitly states that **the head must remain unchanged**, including facial structure, expression, and features.  

Therefore, allowed changes include:  
- Clothing (armor, pants, accessories)  
- Posture (arm positions, leg stance)  
- Equipment (sword, barbell)  
- Background/environment (infographic layout, era-specific scenes)  
- Overall context and composition (split into three panels for eras)  

The only element **explicitly required to be retained** is the **head**, particularly its identity-defining features.

Allowed Changes List:  
- Attire (including armor, pants, belts)  
- Posture (arms, legs, body angle)  
- Held objects (sword, barbell)  
- Background and scene environment  
- Composition/layout (infographic format)  
- Color scheme (though original is monochrome, this can change)  

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements:  
- The **head** is explicitly stated to remain consistent. This includes the **facial structure**, **expression**, and **features** such as the open mouth, narrow eyes, and hairline. These are critical for maintaining identity across transformations. Even if the body changes, the head acts as a visual anchor.  
- Since the instruction specifies “the head remains consistent,” any feature of the head—such as the shape of the jaw, position of the nose, or direction of the gaze—must be preserved. This is a core identity element.  

Functional/logical association elements:  
- The **relationship between the head and body** is logical: even though the body changes, the head must retain its original orientation and expression to maintain continuity. If the head were rotated or distorted, it would break the intended consistency.  
- The **presence of the head in the same relative position** (top-center of the figure) must be maintained for visual coherence.  

Non-modified element deduction:  
- All other elements not listed in the allowed changes list must be retained unless they are part of the transformable body. For example:  
  - The **muscular definition** of the torso is part of the body and thus can change.  
  - But **specific facial features** like the **open mouth**, **narrowed eyes**, and **hairline shape** are not mentioned as changeable and are tied to the head's consistency requirement.  
- The **overall silhouette** may shift due to costume, but the **head’s distinct profile** must remain.  

Preservation Targets List:  
- The facial expression (open mouth, roaring)  
- The eye shape and positioning (narrowed, intense)  
- The hairline and head shape (balding top, side hair)  
- The jawline and chin structure  
- The relative position of the head atop the body (centered, upright)

    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The open mouth with visible teeth and tongue is a core facial feature that defines the character's aggressive expression. It is a key identifier of the original image's emotional tone and character identity. Since the instruction mandates the head remain consistent, this specific detail must be preserved. Loss of this feature would fundamentally alter the character’s expression and make it unrecognizable from the original.
    Question: Is the mouth wide open in a roaring expression with visible teeth and tongue?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The narrowed, intense eyes are essential to the character's fierce demeanor. They are part of the facial expression that must remain unchanged according to the instruction. Altering their shape or openness would break the consistency of the head, affecting the character's identity across transformations.
    Question: Are the eyes narrowed and focused, indicating anger or exertion?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The balding top of the head with side hair is a distinctive feature of the character's appearance. This hair pattern contributes to the unique silhouette of the head and is part of the head's identity. Since the head must remain consistent, this specific hair distribution must be retained.
    Question: Does the head have a balding crown with hair along the sides and back?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The jawline and chin structure define the character’s facial shape and contribute to the aggressive, masculine appearance. This anatomical feature is part of the head and must remain consistent per the instruction. Changing it would result in a different facial identity.
    Question: Is the jawline strong and angular, with a defined chin?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The head is positioned directly above the torso, centered and upright, which maintains the anatomical relationship and visual balance. This spatial relationship is critical for preserving the character’s identity across transformations. Even if the body changes, the head must remain in this relative position.
    Question: Is the head located at the top center of the figure, aligned with the spine?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The facial hair (if present) or lack thereof is a minor but identifiable detail. In this case, there appears to be no beard, only a clean-shaven face with defined cheekbones. Retaining this absence of facial hair ensures consistency in the head’s appearance. While not as critical as the mouth or eyes, it contributes to the overall facial identity.
    Question: Is the face clean-shaven, without a beard or mustache?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
