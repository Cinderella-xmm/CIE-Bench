      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "The profile orientation of the figure is a core compositional element that defines the viewer’s perspective and emotional engagement. Changing from profile to frontal or three-quarter view would fundamentally alter the image’s narrative focus and visual rhythm. Since the instruction does not specify changing the viewing angle, and the Renaissance style often preserves such poses, the profile view is a key identity feature. Its loss would make the figure unrecognizable in context.",
      "question": "Is the figure shown in profile, facing left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The act of holding a vertical ceremonial object in the right hand is a functional and symbolic gesture central to the character’s role. Even though the staff is to be replaced, the physical action of gripping and supporting a long object vertically is essential to maintain continuity in the character’s posture and intent. Altering this would disrupt the logic of the pose and suggest a different action (e.g., walking, gesturing).",
      "question": "Does the right hand grip a long vertical object extending downward from the shoulder?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The golden and earth-toned color palette is explicitly mandated in the instruction (“maintaining rich golden and earth tones”). This is not merely stylistic but a directive to preserve the warmth and atmosphere of the original scene. Deviating significantly (e.g., introducing cool blues or purples) would violate the instruction’s core requirement, affecting the visual coherence and mood.",
      "question": "Are the dominant colors in the image golden, ochre, and earthy browns, consistent with the original sunset lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The figure stands upright with legs slightly apart, which is a stable and grounded posture contributing to the sense of presence and authority. This stance is visually distinct and helps anchor the character in the landscape. While minor adjustments may occur, the fundamental leg position should remain intact to preserve the figure’s balance and spatial relationship to the ground.",
      "question": "Are the legs positioned slightly apart, with weight distributed evenly, suggesting a stable stance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The left arm hangs naturally at the side, contributing to the balance of the figure and avoiding asymmetry. This detail supports the realism of the pose. While the instruction does not specify it, altering this could create an unnatural silhouette. As a minor but coherent detail, it helps maintain visual harmony.",
      "question": "Is the left arm relaxed and hanging straight down along the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The figure is positioned in the foreground, with a clear separation between the person and the background landscape. This depth cue is critical for spatial understanding. The instruction mentions a distant castle, implying a similar depth structure. Therefore, the figure’s placement in the foreground relative to the background must be preserved to maintain compositional logic.",
      "question": "Is the figure located in the foreground, with open space behind it leading to distant hills or structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
