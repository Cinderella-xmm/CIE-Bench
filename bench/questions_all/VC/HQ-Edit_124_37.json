      "thinking_process": "The dark brown skin tone is a core identity feature of the subject, distinguishing her racial and cultural identity. In the context of transforming her into an angelic figure, preserving the skin tone ensures that the original subject's identity remains intact despite stylistic changes. If the skin were lightened or altered significantly, the transformation would lose its grounding in the original image. This is a 3-point element because it is essential for recognition.",
      "question": "Is the subject's skin tone still dark brown?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The upward tilt of the head and upward gaze are critical to conveying the emotion of joy and openness to the sky. This specific orientation is central to the composition and emotional tone of the original image. Even in a Renaissance angelic depiction, the direction of the gaze must remain upward to maintain continuity with the original moment of wonder. Losing this would disrupt the narrative logic of the scene.",
      "question": "Is the subject’s head tilted upward with her gaze directed toward the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The outstretched arms with hands open and facing outward are functional elements that support the dynamic motion of the skirt and express joy. These are not just aesthetic but structural to the image’s balance and narrative. The instruction allows for holding glowing wisps, but the hand position must remain consistent to preserve the original gesture. This is a 2-point element because it is important for posture and action continuity.",
      "question": "Are both arms extended outward with hands open and palms facing forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The presence of braided hair is a distinctive cultural marker and a key detail in the original image. While the instruction allows for transformation into an angelic figure, the absence of braids would erase a significant part of the subject’s identity. Even if stylized, the braid structure should be retained in some form (e.g., flowing strands or halo-like braids). This is a 2-point element because it is culturally significant and visually identifiable.",
      "question": "Does the subject have braided hair, even if stylized?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The flare of the skirt created by the wind and the subject’s movement is a key visual element that defines the image’s dynamism. Even though the dress is transformed into celestial robes, the motion of the fabric flaring outward must be preserved to maintain the sense of freedom and joy. This is a 1-point element because it is a secondary detail but contributes to visual coherence.",
      "question": "Is the lower portion of the garment flaring outward, suggesting motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The facial expression, particularly the smile and visible teeth, is a core emotional identifier. The instruction mentions shifting to \"serene grace,\" but this does not imply erasure of the joyful expression. A gentle smile or serene look can still preserve the original warmth. However, if the mouth is closed or distorted, the emotional continuity is broken. This is a 2-point element because it affects the emotional identity of the subject.",
      "question": "Is the subject smiling with visible teeth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
