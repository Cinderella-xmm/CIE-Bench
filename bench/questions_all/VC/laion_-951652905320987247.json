      "thinking_process": "The symmetrical conical shape of Mount Fuji is its most defining and universally recognized feature. It is the primary identifier of the mountain in any representation. If the shape is altered (e.g., flattened, skewed, or asymmetric), the image would no longer be identifiable as Mount Fuji. This is a core identity element, making it essential to retain even in a stylized or miniature form. Therefore, this question targets the fundamental geometric form of the mountain.",
      "question": "Is the mountain depicted as a symmetrical, perfectly conical shape with a pointed peak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The snow cap is a critical component of Mount Fuji’s appearance, especially in this image where it dominates the upper portion. Its presence and white coloration are essential for recognition. Even if made of glittering material, the snow cap must remain white and cover the summit. Removing or replacing it with a different color or texture would misrepresent the mountain. This is a core identity feature, hence high weight.",
      "question": "Does the summit of the mountain have a continuous white snow cap covering the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "thinking_process": "The lake’s reflection is a hallmark of this particular view of Mount Fuji. It creates a near-perfect mirror image, doubling the visual impact and contributing to the scene’s iconic status. Without this reflection, the image loses its signature aesthetic and becomes unrecognizable as this specific scene. Even in a miniature model, the reflection must be present and aligned with the mountain’s shape.",
      "question": "Is there a clear, mirror-like reflection of the mountain in the lake below?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The shoreline with buildings is a secondary but important detail that anchors the scene in reality. It provides scale and context, distinguishing this from a pure abstract or natural landscape. While the buildings may be replaced with figurines, their presence along the water’s edge must be preserved. Their position and alignment with the lake and mountain are crucial for maintaining scene logic and coherence.",
      "question": "Are there small structures or buildings positioned along the edge of the lake, between the water and the mountain base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The sky is part of the original composition and contributes to the contrast with the white peak. Although the instruction allows material changes, the sky’s position above the mountain and its clear blue color are visually consistent with the original. While the color could theoretically shift due to lighting in a terrarium, the sky must still occupy the upper portion of the image and appear distinct from the mountain and lake. Its presence helps define the scene’s spatial layout.",
      "question": "Is the sky visible above the mountain, appearing as a solid or gradient blue area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The slope transition from snow to dark rock to vegetation is a key detail that adds depth and realism to the mountain. While the materials can be changed (e.g., painted layers instead of natural terrain), the layered progression from white (snow) to brown (rock) to green/yellow (vegetation) must be preserved to maintain the mountain’s realistic profile. This is a detail-level feature but essential for visual consistency.",
      "question": "Are there visible layers on the mountain’s slopes, showing a transition from white snow at the top to darker rock and then to green/brown vegetation below?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
