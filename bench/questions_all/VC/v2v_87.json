      "thinking_process": "The large, fan-shaped ears are a defining anatomical feature of African elephants, distinguishing them from Asian elephants. Their size, shape, and positioning are critical for species identification. In the edited image, even if stylized, the ears must retain their broad, outward-facing form to maintain the correct species identity. Losing this feature would result in misidentification, making it a core recognition element. Therefore, the question directly targets the presence and shape of the ears, which must be preserved.",
      "question": "Does the elephant in the edited image retain large, fan-shaped ears that extend outward from the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The long, curved tusks are another key identifier of African elephants. They are not only functional but also iconic in visual representation. The instruction does not permit removal or alteration of this feature, as it is part of the elephant’s biological identity. Even in a LEGO-style design, the tusk shape must be preserved to ensure accurate species representation. This is a core identity feature, hence weighted at 3 points.",
      "question": "Are the elephant’s tusks long, curved, and off-white in color, extending downward from the upper jaw?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The wrinkled, textured skin is a distinctive trait of elephants, especially evident in the original image. This texture contributes to the animal’s realism and helps differentiate it from smoother animals. Although the style may change, the instruction implies retention of the earthy hue and likely the tactile quality. The texture is a secondary but important detail that supports visual authenticity and continuity. Its loss would reduce fidelity to the original.",
      "question": "Is the elephant’s skin depicted with deep wrinkles and folds, particularly on the trunk, legs, and ears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The five-toed feet are a specific anatomical detail that distinguishes elephants and adds to their realistic portrayal. While the form may be simplified in a LEGO model, the number of toes should still be represented to preserve biological accuracy. This is a minor but informative detail that supports the integrity of the subject’s identity.",
      "question": "Do the elephant’s feet show five distinct toes on each foot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The rich red color of the backpack is explicitly referenced in the instruction as a source for accent color in the new design. This means the color must be preserved, even if the backpack’s form changes. The red hue is a key visual anchor in the original image and serves as a stylistic bridge to the new scene. Its absence would break the intended color logic.",
      "question": "Is the backpack rendered in a rich, saturated red color matching the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The presence of the backpack next to the elephant establishes a visual relationship that is central to the original composition. Although the instruction allows transformation, it does not remove the backpack. The instruction uses its color to inform the design, implying its continued relevance. Therefore, the backpack must remain as a distinct object in proximity to the elephant.",
      "question": "Is the backpack present as a separate object positioned near the elephant in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The identity of the animal as an African elephant is implied by its morphology. The combination of large ears, tusks, and body shape confirms this. The instruction refers to \"African Elephant\" in the nameplate, confirming that the species must be preserved. Any deviation in form must still reflect this identity. This is a core logical requirement.",
      "question": "Is the animal clearly identifiable as an African elephant based on its ear size, tusk shape, and overall body structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
