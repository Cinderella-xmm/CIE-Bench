Description of reference image: The subject is a black drawer cabinet with six compartments placed against a neutral wall under a large circular mirror. On top of the drawer, there are decorative objects, including a vase with pink flowers, a stack of books, and some container-like items. A potted plant with long green leaves stands next to the drawer on the right side. The room is lit by natural light coming through a window on the left, revealing partial greenery outside. The floor is light wood, and a soft rug lies beneath the stool in the corner.
