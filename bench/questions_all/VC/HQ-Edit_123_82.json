      "thinking_process": "The black bob hairstyle is a core identifier of the subject’s appearance. Its length, straightness, and framing of the face are distinctive. Changing it significantly (e.g., longer, curly, colored) would alter her identity. Even in cartoon form, the silhouette and placement must match. Thus, preserving this hairstyle is critical for recognition.",

      "thinking_process": "The red dress is a dominant visual element. Its color and knitted texture define her outfit. While gold embroidery will be added, the base red color and knit pattern must remain. Losing the red color or altering the fabric texture fundamentally would misrepresent the original subject.",

      "thinking_process": "The butterfly wings are central to the theme. Their specific coloration—blue translucent center, brown outer edges, orange tips, and vein patterns—are unique to this image. Even if enlarged or detailed, the fundamental color distribution and wing shape must remain recognizable.",

      "thinking_process": "The hands clasped in front of the chest is a key pose that defines her posture. It conveys a gesture of joy or anticipation. Altering this (e.g., arms at sides, hands down) would change the emotional tone and break continuity.",
      "question": "Are the woman’s hands clasped together in front of her chest with fingers interlocked?",
