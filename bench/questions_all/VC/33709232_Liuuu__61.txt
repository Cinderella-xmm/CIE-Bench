Description of reference image: The subject is a traditional Japanese building with a dark tiled roof and beige walls, located at street level in an urban environment. A prominent white signboard above the entrance displays black kanji characters "どぜう" (Dozeu), indicating the name of the establishment. To the right of this sign is a red triangular stop sign with white text reading "止まれ STOP," combining Japanese and English. Below the main sign, vertical signage on the left side reads "うちおぎ 仮四宿" in black script on a white background. The building features wooden lattice windows and a small wooden balcony with horizontal slats. In front of the building, two pedestrians walk across a crosswalk; one wears a dark jacket and jeans, the other a white shirt and dark pants. A utility pole with numerous wires and streetlights dominates the left foreground. Behind the traditional structure, a tall, modern white high-rise building rises vertically, featuring evenly spaced rectangular windows and a clean, minimalist design. The sky is clear and deep blue. On the right side of the frame, additional modern buildings appear, including one with solar panels on the roof. Traffic signs are visible: a blue circular arrow indicating one-way traffic and a pedestrian crossing sign below it. A bicycle is parked near the curb on the far right.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions to determine what can be changed. The instruction explicitly states:  
- Transform the **tall building** into a **towering automaton** with a sleek, white, armored body and mechanical windows as apertures → *this allows full transformation of the high-rise’s form, material, and function*.  
- Convert the **traditional Japanese roof** into **stylized shoulder pads** with intricate patterns → *the roof's structure and symbolic role are to be reimagined, so its original form is not preserved*.  
- Replace **traffic signs** with **holographic symbols** → *physical signs are to be replaced, so their current appearance is not retained*.  
- Alter the streetscape by integrating **robotic pedestrians** with geometric designs → *human figures are to be replaced, so their biological appearance is no longer required*.  

Thus, allowed changes include:  
- The **form and material** of the tall building (now an automaton).  
- The **structure and design** of the traditional roof (now shoulder pads).  
- The **appearance and type** of traffic signs (now holographic).  
- The **identity and design** of pedestrians (now robotic).  
- The **overall streetscape layout**, including integration of futuristic elements.  

These changes permit extensive modification of architectural forms, signage, human figures, and environmental textures, but only if they do not contradict the preservation of core identity or functional logic elements that are not mentioned for change.

Allowed Changes List:  
- The shape, texture, and material of the tall white high-rise building  
- The structural form of the traditional roof (to become stylized shoulder pads)  
- The visual design of traffic signs (to become holographic)  
- The appearance and posture of pedestrians (to become robotic)  
- The overall aesthetic and technological style of the streetscape

Step 2 – Determine the elements that should remain unchanged  

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements:  
- The **"どぜう" signboard** is a key identifier of the establishment. Its presence, position, and content are central to recognizing the specific business depicted. It is not mentioned for replacement, so it must remain intact.  
- The **vertical sign "うちおぎ 仮四宿"** is another unique textual element tied to the identity of the place. As part of the building’s branding, it is essential for recognition.  
- The **red triangular stop sign with "止まれ STOP"** contains bilingual text that is iconic in Japanese urban scenes. Though the instruction says to replace traffic signs, it does not specify this one directly—however, since the instruction broadly replaces “traffic signs,” this may be included. But given its prominence and specificity, we must check whether it is explicitly targeted. Since it is a standard traffic sign, and the instruction says “replace traffic signs,” it likely falls under that category. However, if the instruction had said “replace all signs except the business name,” then it would be preserved. Here, it is ambiguous. But since the instruction does not mention preserving any specific sign, and says “replace traffic signs,” we assume it is to be replaced. Therefore, **not preserved**.  
- The **position and relative scale** of the traditional building in front of the tall skyscraper must remain consistent in terms of spatial relationship, even if both are transformed. The **foreground-background hierarchy** is implied by the scene and must be preserved unless stated otherwise.  
- The **utility pole with multiple wires and attached fixtures** is a distinct urban feature. It is not mentioned for change, so it should remain.  
- The **bicycle parked near the curb** is a minor detail but contributes to the realism of the scene. Unless specified, it should remain.  

Functional/logical association elements:  
- The **crosswalk pattern** (white stripes) is essential for understanding pedestrian movement and road function. Even if pedestrians are robotic, the crosswalk must remain to maintain logical coherence.  
- The **doorway and entrance area** of the building must retain its function as an access point. While the facade may be stylized, the entrance must still exist in the same location.  
- The **relative positions of the buildings**: the traditional building must still be in front of the tall skyscraper, maintaining the depth and perspective of the original scene. This ensures visual consistency and prevents disorientation.  

Non-modified element deduction:  
After excluding elements allowed to change (high-rise, roof, signs, pedestrians), the remaining unmentioned details must be preserved. These include:  
- The **"どぜう" signboard**  
- The **"うちおぎ 仮四宿" vertical sign**  
- The **utility pole and wiring**  
- The **bicycle**  
- The **crosswalk markings**  
- The **entrance door and surrounding wall structure**  
- The **window lattices** (though possibly stylized, their presence and position should be maintained)  
- The **clear blue sky** (as background context, unless altered globally)  

Important reminder: All retention decisions are based solely on the original image and exclusion from the allowed change list. No elements are assumed without visual evidence.

Preservation Targets List:  
- The white signboard with black kanji "どぜう"  
- The vertical sign with "うちおぎ 仮四宿"  
- The utility pole with multiple wires and attached streetlights  
- The crosswalk with white stripes on the road  
- The bicycle parked near the curb  
- The entrance doorway of the traditional building  
- The window lattice pattern on the building façade  
- The relative positioning of the traditional building in front of the tall skyscraper  

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Q1:  
Thinking process: The "どぜう" signboard is a core identity feature of the establishment. Its presence, placement above the entrance, and specific calligraphy are critical for identifying the business. If removed or altered, the building loses its primary identity. This is a key visual element tied to cultural and commercial recognition, making it a 3-point question.  
Question: Is the white rectangular signboard with the black kanji "どぜう" present above the entrance of the traditional building?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The vertical sign "うちおぎ 仮四宿" is a secondary but important identifier of the location. It provides contextual information about the establishment and is visually distinct. Its removal would reduce authenticity and recognition of the specific site. Though not as central as the main sign, it is a significant detail that supports identity.  
Question: Is the vertical white sign with black Japanese text "うちおぎ 仮四宿" mounted on the left side of the building?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The utility pole with its complex network of wires and attached fixtures is a defining feature of the urban landscape. Its silhouette and position are crucial for grounding the scene in reality. Removing or altering it would disrupt the authenticity of the streetscape. It is not mentioned for change, so it must be preserved.

Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The crosswalk with white stripes is a functional element that defines pedestrian movement. Even if robotic pedestrians are introduced, the crosswalk must remain to maintain logical coherence in the scene. Its absence would break the spatial logic of the street.  
Question: Are white zebra crossing stripes visible on the road surface in front of the building?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The bicycle parked near the curb is a minor but realistic detail contributing to the everyday atmosphere. It is not mentioned for change, so it should remain. Its presence adds environmental authenticity and helps anchor the scene.  
Question: Is a bicycle parked on the sidewalk near the right edge of the image?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The entrance doorway of the traditional building is a functional and architectural core element. Even if the building is stylized, the entrance must remain in the same location to preserve spatial logic and accessibility. Its position relative to the signs and windows is fixed.  
Question: Is there a dark doorway with hanging curtains visible at the center of the building’s ground floor?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The window lattice pattern is a distinctive architectural feature of traditional Japanese buildings. While the instruction allows transformation of the roof, it does not mention altering the windows. Their presence and arrangement contribute to the building’s identity and style.  
Question: Are there horizontal wooden lattices visible on the upper level of the building’s façade?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q8:  
Thinking process: The relative positioning of the traditional building in front of the tall skyscraper establishes depth and urban context. Even if both structures are transformed, their spatial relationship must be preserved to maintain scene coherence. This is a core compositional element.  
Question: Is the traditional building positioned in front of the tall white skyscraper, creating a layered depth effect?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
