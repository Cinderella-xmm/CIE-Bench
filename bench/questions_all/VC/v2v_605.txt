Description of reference image: The subject is a large, upright silverback gorilla standing in a dense jungle environment. The gorilla is positioned centrally, facing forward with its mouth wide open in a roar, revealing sharp teeth and a bright orange-red interior of the mouth. Its arms are bent at the elbows, hands clenched into fists and placed on its chest, emphasizing muscular definition. The fur is thick, dark gray to black, with a slightly lighter patch on the back of the head and shoulders, characteristic of a dominant male silverback. The facial features include a broad, flat nose, deep-set eyes, and pronounced brow ridges. The skin around the face is dark, almost black, contrasting with the lighter fur. The background consists of lush green foliage, tall trees, and misty atmospheric conditions, creating a sense of depth and natural habitat. The lighting is soft and diffused, suggesting an overcast or foggy day in the rainforest.

Thinking process: First, analyze the instructions that clearly state what can be changed. The instruction specifies transforming the gorilla into a Funko Pop-style box in isometric perspective, which means the form, posture, and presentation of the gorilla itself can be altered. The packaging design, including the title "JUNGLE KING," is explicitly introduced as new content, so it is not part of the original image and does not need to be preserved. The chibi-style figure inside the box and the realistic version outside are also newly created elements, not present in the original. The scene (jungle) is not required to be retained, as the instruction does not specify preserving the background or environment. Therefore, the allowed changes include:
- The physical form and posture of the gorilla (transformed into a stylized figure)
- The overall composition and layout (replaced by a product display setup)
- The background environment (can be replaced or removed)
- The addition of new objects such as the box, accessories, and text

Allowed Changes List:
- The shape, size, and orientation of the gorilla (to become a Funko Pop figure)
- The expression and pose of the gorilla (from roaring to static chibi style)
- The presence and appearance of the packaging box
- The inclusion of accessories like the leafy crown and wooden staff
- The addition of the title "JUNGLE KING"
- The creation of a second realistic version of the figure outside the box
- The background setting (jungle can be replaced or omitted)

Step 2 - Determine the elements that should remain unchanged

Thinking process:
Core recognition elements: The original image features a silverback gorilla, which has specific biological and visual identifiers essential for species recognition. These include the dark fur coloration, the prominent silver saddle on the back (though not fully visible here), the facial structure (broad nose, dark skin, pronounced brow ridges), and the muscular build. Even though the form will be transformed, the core identity of the subject as a gorilla must be preserved through these distinguishing traits. If the edited version lacks these features, it would no longer represent a gorilla, undermining the intended transformation.

Functional/logical association elements: The gorilla’s posture—standing upright with hands on chest and mouth open—is a key behavioral trait associated with dominance displays. While this specific pose may be altered in the chibi version, the underlying intent (dominance, strength) should still be reflected in the stylized figure. However, since the instruction allows for stylistic reinterpretation, the exact posture is not strictly required to be preserved. Instead, the functional logic of the gorilla being a powerful, dominant figure must be maintained in the new representation.

Non modified element deduction: After excluding all elements explicitly allowed to change (form, pose, background, accessories), the remaining unmentioned but visually present details in the original image must be considered for retention. These include the texture of the fur, the color contrast between the dark face and body, the anatomical proportions (e.g., large chest, broad shoulders), and the environmental context (dense jungle). However, since the instruction does not require retaining the scene, only the subject's core identity needs to be preserved.

Preservation Targets List:
- The dark gray to black fur coloration of the gorilla
- The dark facial skin with prominent brow ridges and broad nose
- The muscular build and broad chest
- The presence of a silverback-like feature (lighter fur on the back/shoulders)
- The anatomical proportion of the limbs and torso

Q1:  
Thinking process: The dark gray to black fur coloration is a core identification feature of the gorilla. This coloration distinguishes it from other primates and is essential for recognizing the animal as a gorilla. In the edited image, even if stylized, the fur must retain this dark tone to maintain species identity. Losing this would make the figure unrecognizable as a gorilla, hence it is a critical element with a weight of 3 points.  
Question: Is the gorilla depicted with predominantly dark gray to black fur?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The dark facial skin, especially around the eyes, nose, and mouth, is a distinctive trait of gorillas. It contrasts sharply with the fur and helps define the facial structure. This feature is crucial for accurate species recognition. If absent or altered significantly, the figure might resemble another primate. Thus, it is a key identifying element with a weight of 3 points.  
Question: Does the gorilla have dark, almost black skin on its face?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The broad, muscular chest and defined pectoral muscles are hallmark features of a silverback gorilla, indicating dominance and strength. These anatomical details are essential for conveying the correct species and gender. Even in a stylized form, the general mass and shape of the chest must be preserved to maintain realism and identity. This is a significant structural feature, warranting a weight of 2 points.  
Question: Is the gorilla shown with a broad, muscular chest and visible pectoral definition?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The presence of a lighter-colored patch on the back and shoulders (the silver saddle) is a defining trait of adult male gorillas. Although partially obscured in some views, its existence is implied by the subject’s status as a silverback. This feature is critical for identifying the individual as a dominant male. Its absence would misrepresent the subject, making it a high-priority retention element with a weight of 3 points.  
Question: Is there a lighter-colored area on the gorilla’s back and shoulders, indicative of a silverback?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The facial structure, including the broad nose and pronounced brow ridges, contributes to the gorilla’s unique appearance. These features are not just aesthetic but functional in species identification. Altering them could lead to confusion with other apes. While stylization may simplify them, their essence must remain. This is a key facial identifier, thus assigned a weight of 2 points.  
Question: Does the gorilla have a broad, flat nose and prominent brow ridges?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The posture of the gorilla—standing upright with hands on chest and mouth open—is a signature dominance display. While the instruction allows for transformation, the intent behind the pose (strength, power) should be preserved in the stylized version. The hand placement on the chest is a specific detail that conveys this behavior. Retaining this gesture ensures continuity in the character’s expression, making it a meaningful detail with a weight of 2 points.  
Question: Are the gorilla’s hands placed on its chest in a dominant stance?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2
