      "thinking_process": "The red-and-white vertical stripes on the jersey are a defining visual feature of the team uniform and are central to the subject’s identity. This pattern is unique and essential for recognizing the player’s affiliation and outfit. Changing it would alter the core visual identity of the character. Therefore, its presence and pattern must be preserved.",
      "question": "Is the red-and-white vertically striped jersey with a white collar still present on the boy?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The black-and-white paneled soccer ball is an iconic object in football imagery. Its specific design (pentagons and hexagons) is universally recognized. Altering this would make the ball unidentifiable as a traditional football, undermining the sport’s authenticity in the scene. It is a core object in the composition.",
      "question": "Is the classic black-and-white paneled soccer ball still under the boy’s foot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The boy’s pose—left leg raised, right foot on the ball—is critical to conveying motion and skill. This dynamic stance defines the action of the image. Any change to limb positioning would disrupt the narrative of active play and reduce the image’s impact. It is a functional and compositional core element.",
      "question": "Is the boy’s left leg raised while his right foot remains in contact with the soccer ball?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The red socks with white cuffs are a distinctive accessory that matches the jersey and completes the team uniform. They contribute to the visual consistency of the player’s attire. Their absence or alteration would affect the authenticity of the outfit and break the color scheme.",
      "question": "Are the red socks with white cuffs visible on both legs of the boy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The boy’s face, particularly his smile and direct gaze, establishes emotional engagement with the viewer. This expression is a key part of the image’s charm and narrative tone. Removing or distorting it would change the mood and personal connection implied in the original.",
      "question": "Is the boy’s face clearly visible with a smiling expression and looking toward the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The shadow cast by the boy on the grass provides depth and confirms the lighting direction and physical presence in the scene. It supports the realism of the moment. While lighting may be adjusted for vintage effect, the shadow’s existence and general shape should remain consistent to maintain spatial logic.",
      "question": "Is the shadow of the boy visible on the green field beneath him?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The green football pitch with white boundary lines defines the playing environment. Even with a retro filter, the field’s structure must remain identifiable to preserve the context of the game. Altering the field color or removing lines would misrepresent the setting.",
      "question": "Is the green football field with white boundary lines still visible beneath the players?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "thinking_process": "The presence of other players in the background contributes to the sense of a live match. Their positions and contrasting uniforms (e.g., white vs. red-and-white) help establish team dynamics. While background simplification is allowed, their basic forms and positions must remain to maintain scene coherence.",
      "question": "Are multiple players visible in the background, some wearing red-and-white kits and others in different colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
