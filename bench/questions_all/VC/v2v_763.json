      "thinking_process": "The number \"18\" on the back of the jersey is a core identification feature of the player. It is a unique identifier that distinguishes this individual from others. In any stylized version, the number must remain present and legible to preserve the player’s identity. Losing this element would make the character unrecognizable as the original subject. Therefore, it is a key visual element with a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the number \"18\" clearly visible on the back of the player's jersey?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The number \"18\" on the front left side of the jersey is another critical identifier, reinforcing the player’s identity. While less prominent than the back number, it is still a distinctive feature that contributes to the overall recognition of the uniform. Its absence would reduce the fidelity of the representation, especially in close-up views. This is an important detail that supports identity consistency, hence a weight of 2 points.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The purple color of the jersey and cap is a defining characteristic of the player’s team affiliation and personal appearance. Changing this color would alter the visual identity of the subject. Even in a chibi style, the dominant color must remain purple to maintain continuity. This is a core recognition element, thus assigned a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the player wearing a purple jersey and a purple cap with a black brim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The white batting gloves are a standard piece of equipment and a consistent visual feature in the original image. They are not mentioned as changeable in the instructions, so they must be retained. Their presence helps identify the player as a batter and maintains realism in the equipment. While stylized, they should remain white and worn on both hands. This is a secondary but important detail, hence a weight of 2 points.",
      "question": "Are the player's hands covered with white batting gloves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The black baseball bat is a functional object central to the action. The player is gripping it in a specific way, and its presence is essential to the batting pose. Even in a chibi style, the bat must remain black and held in the same two-handed grip to preserve the action logic. This is a key functional element, so it carries a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the player holding a black baseball bat with both hands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The white baseball with red stitching is a universally recognized object in baseball. Its presence and motion are critical to the scene’s narrative. The red stitching is a distinctive texture that identifies it as a real baseball. Even in a stylized version, the ball must retain its white color and red stitching to be recognizable. This is a core functional and visual element, thus a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Is there a white baseball with red stitching visible in the air, approaching the bat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The player’s dynamic batting stance — including bent knees, twisted torso, and head turned toward the ball — is essential to conveying the moment of action. This posture defines the scene and must be preserved in some form, even if stylized. Altering it would disrupt the narrative of the swing. This is a key action-related element, so it is assigned a weight of 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the player in a crouched batting stance with knees bent and torso twisted forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2

    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "thinking_process": "The two-handed grip on the bat is a functional detail that shows how the player is preparing to hit. It is a specific hand placement that must be retained to maintain the authenticity of the batting action. Even in a chibi style, the hands should be positioned near the handle of the bat. This is a minor but important detail that supports the action logic, hence a weight of 1 point.",
      "question": "Are both hands gripping the bat near the handle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
