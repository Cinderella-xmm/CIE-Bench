      "thinking_process": "The flag on the tallest tower is a distinct visual marker in the original image, located at the apex of the central spire. Its presence and position are critical for identifying the specific sandcastle design. If removed or relocated, the identity of the structure would be compromised. This is a core recognition feature because it is unique to this composition and not found on all sandcastles. Thus, it carries high weight.",
      "question": "Is the flag positioned at the top of the tallest central spire of the sandcastle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The dual spiral staircases are a defining architectural feature, forming a mirrored pair that leads to the central platform. Their shape and symmetry are integral to the castle's identity. Altering their form or removing one would disrupt the structural balance and make the model unrecognizable. This is a key functional and aesthetic element.",
      "question": "Are there two spiral staircases symmetrically positioned on either side of the central entrance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The central arched entrance with intricate latticework above it is a signature detail of the sandcastle’s facade. It serves as a focal point and distinguishes this design from simpler sandcastles. Removing or simplifying this carving would lose essential identity information. It is a core architectural feature.",
      "question": "Is there a central arched doorway with ornate latticework directly above it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The conical turrets are a recurring motif throughout the structure, with varying heights and placements. Their specific number and arrangement (e.g., five visible turrets on one side) define the castle’s silhouette. Changing their count or shape would alter the visual identity. While the material may change, their geometric form must remain.",
      "question": "Are there at least seven conical turrets visible around the perimeter of the sandcastle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The presence of starfish and seashells around the base is part of the original scene’s environmental storytelling. Although they may be stylized or repositioned in the new display, their inclusion is implied in the instruction (“incorporate tiny, ornately detailed seashells”). Therefore, their **presence** must be preserved, even if modified in texture or finish. This is a secondary but important contextual element.",
      "question": "Are starfish and seashells visibly present around the base of the sandcastle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The symmetrical layout of the castle, particularly the mirrored towers and staircases, is fundamental to its design. Asymmetry would break the intended aesthetic and suggest a different structure. This symmetry is a logical and visual necessity for maintaining identity.",
      "question": "Is the sandcastle designed with bilateral symmetry along its central vertical axis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The detailed carvings on the walls and arches contribute to the ornate character of the sandcastle. While the texture may be enhanced with glittering grains, the underlying patterns (e.g., floral or geometric motifs) must remain visually intact to preserve artistic fidelity. These are non-core but significant detail elements.",
      "question": "Are there decorative carvings visible on the surfaces of the towers and archways?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "thinking_process": "The central tower is the tallest and most prominent, serving as the visual anchor of the structure. Its dominance in height and position is essential for identification. If another tower were made taller or if the central one were reduced, the composition would be fundamentally altered.",
      "question": "Is the tallest tower located at the center of the sandcastle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
