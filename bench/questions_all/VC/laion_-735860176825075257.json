      "thinking_process": "The half-timbered gable ends are the defining architectural feature of the Tudor style, immediately identifying the building as such. Their presence and triangular shape are essential for recognition. Even if stylized, they must remain visually identifiable as part of the façade. Losing this feature would make the building unrecognizable as a Tudor-style hotel.",
      "question": "Are the black-and-white half-timbered gable ends visible and positioned at the top of the central and right-side sections of the building?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The black arched door on the left side is a unique structural element that distinguishes this part of the building from others. It is not merely decorative but serves as a key visual anchor in the composition. Its removal or relocation would misrepresent the building’s layout.",
      "question": "Is there a black arched door located on the left side of the building, embedded within the brick wall below the window ledge?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The \"Leeds Parkway Hotel\" sign is the primary identifier of the establishment. Its placement under the awning and legibility are crucial for functional recognition. While the color may change, the text and its location must remain intact.",
      "question": "Is the sign reading \"Leeds Parkway Hotel\" present beneath the entrance awning, aligned horizontally above the main doors?",

      "thinking_process": "The flower planters along the base and window sills are recurring decorative elements that contribute to the building’s charm and symmetry. They are not merely background details but part of the intentional landscaping. Their absence would reduce visual completeness and break continuity.",
      "question": "Are there rectangular planters with colorful flowers positioned along the base of the building, both in front of the black arched door and near the entrance steps?",

      "thinking_process": "The windows, especially the dormer windows on the roof and the bay window on the right wing, are key architectural features that define the building’s silhouette and proportion. Their grid patterns and placements are consistent with Tudor design and must remain to preserve authenticity.",
      "question": "Are there multiple windows with white frames arranged in grid patterns, including dormer windows on the roof and a bay window on the right side of the building?",

      "thinking_process": "The entrance doors under the awning are the functional entry point and a central focus of the image. Their position directly beneath the awning and their double-door configuration are essential for spatial logic. Changing their location or form would mislead viewers about the building’s layout.",
      "question": "Are the main entrance doors located centrally under the awning, consisting of two wooden doors with glass panels?",

      "thinking_process": "The brickwork base of the building, particularly the red brick walls and the archway around the black door, defines the lower portion of the structure. This material contrast between brick and timber is a core visual feature of Tudor architecture. Altering its texture or removing it would distort the building’s identity.",
      "question": "Is the lower section of the building constructed from red brick, with an arched opening housing the black door?",
