      "thinking_process": "The presence of the wide brim is a defining structural feature of the bucket hat. It is essential for identifying the hat type. Removing or significantly altering its width would transform it into a different kind of headwear, such as a cap or beret. Since the instruction only modifies the style and not the fundamental form, the brim's width must be preserved. This is a core identity element, and losing it would make the object unrecognizable as a bucket hat.",
      "question": "Is the hat still a wide-brimmed bucket hat with a broad, outward-facing brim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The model's facial structure, especially the shape of the eyes, nose, and lips, is a core identification feature. These are unique to the individual and distinguish her from others. Any alteration to these features would result in a different person, violating the principle of identity retention. The instruction does not mention modifying the face, so it must remain unchanged.",
      "question": "Are the eyes, nose, and mouth in their original positions and shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The hair’s color (light brown), length (shoulder-length), and curl pattern (soft waves) are key identifiers of the subject’s appearance. While the instruction allows modification of accessories, it does not mention changing the hair. Altering the hair color or style would misrepresent the original subject. These traits are essential for visual consistency and identity preservation.",
      "question": "Does the hair retain its original light brown color and wavy texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The sleeveless white top is visible and contributes to the overall composition and attire context. Although not the focus, it is a consistent element that anchors the subject’s clothing. Changing the top would alter the outfit and potentially misrepresent the intended look. The instruction does not mention clothing changes, so it must remain.",
      "question": "Is the visible portion of the clothing a white sleeveless top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The background is plain white, which provides a neutral setting that emphasizes the subject. The instruction does not specify changing the background, so it must remain unaltered. A changed background could distract or misrepresent the scene. This is a secondary but important environmental element for maintaining visual coherence.",
      "question": "Is the background a solid white with no additional elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The hat's crown height and shape are critical for maintaining its bucket hat identity. While the surface design may change, the crown must remain rounded and structured to preserve the original silhouette. Altering the crown’s depth or shape would distort the hat’s form beyond recognition.",
      "question": "Does the hat have a rounded crown with consistent height relative to the brim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The lighting is uniform and bright, highlighting the subject’s features without casting harsh shadows. This lighting setup is essential for clarity and consistency in the image. The instruction does not mention lighting adjustments, so it must remain unchanged. Altered lighting could affect perception of skin tone, hair, and hat texture.",
      "question": "Is the lighting even and bright across the face and hat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
