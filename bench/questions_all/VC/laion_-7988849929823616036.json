      "thinking_process": "The mustache is a defining facial feature of S. W. Kramer in the original image. Its shape, thickness, and upward curl at the ends are distinctive and contribute significantly to his identity. If removed or altered beyond recognition, the subject would no longer be identifiable as the same individual. This is a core recognition element, making its retention critical.",
      "question": "Is the mustache present with its original shape, including upward curls at the ends?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The eyes and their positioning relative to the nose and forehead are key identifiers. Their placement, size, and direction (looking directly forward) establish the subject’s expression and identity. Altering their position or shape would distort recognition.",
      "question": "Are both eyes visible and positioned symmetrically with the bridge of the nose aligned centrally?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The hairline and receding hair pattern are unique to the subject and contribute to facial identity. Even if the hair is stylized, its general shape and distribution must be preserved to maintain likeness.",
      "question": "Is the hairline clearly defined with a receding pattern at the temples?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The bow tie, although to be redesigned, must remain in the same physical location—centered at the neck, forming a symmetrical knot. Its spatial relationship to the shirt collar and suit jacket is essential for maintaining logical garment structure.",
      "question": "Is the bow tie located at the center of the neck, forming a symmetrical knot beneath the collar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The name \"S. W. Kramer\" is a textual identifier that anchors the image to its subject. Removing or altering it would sever the historical context and make the image unidentifiable in terms of provenance.",
      "question": "Is the text \"S. W. Kramer.\" present below the image in the same font and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The overall posture—head slightly turned to the left, shoulders squared, direct gaze—is essential for preserving the original composition and identity. Any major shift in angle or body tilt would alter the intended portrayal.",
      "question": "Is the subject’s head turned slightly to the left, with the body facing forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The photo border and surrounding margin are part of the original document layout. They provide framing and context, especially given the watermark and website attribution. Their removal or alteration would disrupt the archival integrity.",
      "question": "Is the image framed within a rectangular border with visible margins on all sides?",
