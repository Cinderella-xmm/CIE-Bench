      "thinking_process": "The red, gray, and navy blue color blocks are the core visual identity of the comforter and serve as the basis for the \"patchwork fur\" transformation. These specific colors define the creature’s appearance and are essential for maintaining continuity between the original and edited image. Losing any of these colors would fundamentally alter the intended design. Therefore, this is a core identity element with a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Are the red, gray, and navy blue sections of the comforter present in the edited image, preserving their original color distribution?",

      "thinking_process": "The plaid accent pillow is a distinctive feature in the original image, located centrally on the bed. It adds contrast and detail to the composition. In the transformed version, it may become part of the creature’s facial markings or body pattern, but its presence and location are critical for visual continuity. Its absence would disrupt the recognizable layout. Thus, it is a key accessory with a weight of 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the small square plaid pillow (with red, navy, and white checks) still present on the bed, positioned near the center?",

      "thinking_process": "The spatial relationship between the pillows and the comforter is essential for logical coherence. The pillows rest on top of the comforter in the original image, and this layering must be preserved in the transformation to maintain realism in the creature’s form. If the pillows were moved below or detached, it would break the functional logic of bedding. This is a structural/functional element with a weight of 2 points.",

Removing or replacing it would shift the scene’s atmosphere and undermine the original setting. While not a core identity element, it is a key environmental anchor, so it has a weight of 2 points.",

Since it is not mentioned in the editing instruction, it should remain unchanged. Its removal or relocation would disrupt the balance of the room. This is a minor but important detail with a weight of 1 point.",

Light gray walls and wooden floors are not referenced for change, so they must remain to preserve the original environment. Their alteration would create a different setting entirely.
