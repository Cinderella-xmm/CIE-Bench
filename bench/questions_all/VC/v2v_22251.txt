### Step 1 - Analyzing Allowed Changes

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a person with long, straight black hair, wearing a black blazer over a graphic T-shirt featuring a skeleton design and the text "ATTI." The individual has green dangling earrings and a neutral expression. The background is plain and neutral-colored, providing no additional context.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instructions specify transforming the attire and style to a Renaissance aesthetic. This means the clothing, background, and overall style can be altered significantly. However, the core identity of the subject must remain intact.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
1. Clothing can be changed to Renaissance-style garments with intricate patterns.  
2. The background can be replaced with one reminiscent of classical paintings.  
3. Hairstyle can be adjusted to fit the Renaissance theme.  
4. The graphic T-shirt can be replaced with an appropriate Renaissance-era design.  

### Step 2 - Determining Elements That Should Remain Unchanged

**Thinking process:**  
Core recognition elements include the subject's face, hair color, and earrings. Functional/logical elements include the subject's posture and orientation. Remaining elements like the T-shirt design and background are not critical and can be changed.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
1. The subject's face and facial features.  
2. The subject's long black hair.  
3. The green earrings.  
4. The subject's posture and orientation.
