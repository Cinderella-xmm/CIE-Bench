      "thinking_process": "The intricate floral and vine motifs are the defining ornamental feature of the teapot, forming a continuous, symmetrical pattern across the body and lid. Their preservation is explicitly required in the instructions (\"retain the intricate floral motifs\"), making them a core identity element. Any loss or simplification would break the visual continuity and diminish the luxurious aesthetic. Thus, this is a high-weight question.",
      "question": "Are the intricate floral and vine motifs present in their original pattern and spatial arrangement across the body and lid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The camel red hue is a key chromatic identifier of the original teapot. The instruction mandates that this color be maintained in the glass chamber, indicating that the red tone must be preserved exactly. Since this is a specific color requirement tied to the original visual identity, its absence would make the edited version visually inconsistent.",
      "question": "Is the central chamber rendered in a rich camel red hue matching the original teapot’s body color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The handle’s contour is directly referenced in the instruction to inspire the new wooden lid. This means the shape of the handle must remain visually identifiable. Its unique flowing, organic curve is a distinctive design feature that defines the teapot’s elegance. Losing this shape would undermine the design logic of the transformation.",
      "question": "Is the contour of the teapot handle clearly visible and accurately preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The spout’s curved form contributes to the teapot’s balanced silhouette. Though not explicitly mentioned, its presence is essential to maintaining the original object’s identity. The instruction does not suggest replacing or altering it, so it should be retained. Its shape is a secondary but necessary structural element for recognition.",
      "question": "Is the spout’s curved, elongated shape preserved without alteration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The base structure supports both the physical stability of the teapot and serves as a platform for the new brand logo. Its decorative silver band with scrollwork is a distinct feature. Since the logo is to be placed on it, the base must remain intact in form and position. Altering it would compromise both functionality and visual coherence.",
      "question": "Is the base structure, including its decorative silver band, preserved in form and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The embossed texture of the metallic details (flowers, vines, borders) is a key tactile and visual characteristic. Even though the material changes from silver to gold, the raised, detailed relief must remain. This texture defines the craftsmanship and luxury aspect. Loss of embossing would flatten the design and violate the intent of retaining ornateness.",
      "question": "Are the metallic details still rendered with embossed, raised textures rather than flat or painted designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The overall rounded, bulbous body shape is the fundamental form of the teapot. It provides the canvas for all other design elements. The instruction implies a transformation into a candle holder, but one that retains the teapot’s silhouette. Changing this shape would fundamentally alter the object’s identity.",
      "question": "Is the body of the object still a rounded, bulbous form consistent with the original teapot’s shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
