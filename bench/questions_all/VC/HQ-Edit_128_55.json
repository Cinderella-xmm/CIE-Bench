      "thinking_process": "The golden spherical knocker is a key identifying feature of the original door, located centrally at the lower third of the door. Its reflective metallic sheen and spherical shape distinguish it from the surrounding wood and studs. It is not mentioned in the editing instruction to be removed or transformed, only that the door becomes a creature. Therefore, its presence and position must be preserved to maintain visual continuity. Loss of this element would significantly alter the door’s identity and make the transformation appear inconsistent with the source. Hence, it is a core visual anchor with a weight of 3 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The geometric carving patterns on the door panels are characteristic of Moroccan Islamic art, featuring interlocking stars, polygons, and arabesques. These patterns are integral to the door’s identity and are not mentioned as being erased or replaced. While the instruction allows extending them into wings, the original patterns must remain visible in the base form. Their loss would erase the cultural and artistic essence of the door. Thus, their presence is critical for identification and coherence.",

      "thinking_process": "The black metal studs arranged in horizontal bands are a defining feature of traditional Moroccan doors. They serve both decorative and protective functions. The instruction states they are to be \"morphed into shimmering eyes,\" which implies their **positions and alignment** must be preserved to allow for plausible transformation. If their spacing or number is altered, the eye transformation would appear unnatural. Thus, their **arrangement** must remain intact.",

      "thinking_process": "The surrounding adobe wall, with its cracked and weathered texture, provides crucial environmental context. It grounds the door in a real-world setting and contributes to the aged, historical feel. The instruction does not mention modifying the wall, so it must remain unchanged. Altering its texture or color would disrupt the scene’s authenticity and visual coherence.",

Since it is not referenced in the editing instruction, it must be preserved. Its absence would create an imbalance in the composition and remove a key contextual clue.",

Though the instruction says to integrate it into a cloak, the **original outline and proportions** must remain to ensure the transformation is coherent. If the frame’s shape is distorted, the creature’s integration would appear illogical.",
