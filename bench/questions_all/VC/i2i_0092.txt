Description of reference image: The subject is a modern smartphone displayed on a white phone stand placed on a smooth white table surface. The phone has a large black screen with rounded edges and a slim design, and the stand holds the phone upright with a slight tilt. The background is a plain gray wall, and there is no additional decoration, ensuring the focus remains on the phone and stand.

### Step 1 - Carefully read the editing instructions and identify allowed changes:

**Thinking process:** Analyze each component of the instruction systematically. We're replacing the phone and stand with a seaside café tabletop setting, which means the phone and stand will be removed entirely. However, some aspects of the scene setup need to mimic the original composition in terms of focal placement and perspective. 

**Allowed Changes List:**
1. The smartphone and stand can be replaced entirely.
2. The background and table surface can be substituted with a seaside café setting featuring sunlight and sea wave reflections.
3. The overall composition and lighting may be adjusted to fit the new setting.

### Step 2 - Determine elements that should remain unchanged:

**Thinking process:** Focus on what must stay intact to preserve the essence of the image despite the transformation:

1. **Core Recognition Elements:** None of the original objects will remain, so no specific element here.
2. **Functional/Logical Association Elements:** The central placement of the main subject (new tabletop objects) and the perspective of viewing the scene should remain consistent.
3. **Remaining Non-Modified Elements:** The general clean and minimalistic style (no clutter or distractions in the scene) should be maintained for visual coherence.

**Preservation Targets List:**
- Central placement of the main subject.
- Clean and minimalistic style (no clutter or distractions).
- Consistent perspective and composition.

### Step 3 - Generate questions to assess the retention of edited elements:

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: Central placement ensures the viewer's focus remains on the new subject, maintaining visual harmony. Losing this would disrupt the balance of the new scene.
    Question: Is the main subject of the new scene (seaside café elements) centrally positioned on the table?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The clean and uncluttered style is crucial for matching the original image’s aesthetic, even with different content. Any added elements would detract from the minimalist feel.
    Question: Does the new scene retain a clean and minimalistic style with no extraneous objects or clutter?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: Maintaining the perspective keeps the viewer's experience consistent with the original. Altering the perspective could make the new scene feel disjointed.
    Question: Is the perspective and composition of the new scene consistent with the original, providing a clear view of the seaside café tabletop?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: Sunlight reflections are key to creating the intended atmosphere in the edited scene. These should be clearly visible on the table surface to convey the new setting effectively.
    Question: Are there distinct sunlight reflections visible on the table surface in the new scene?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: Including sea wave reflections adds authenticity to the seaside café environment, contributing significantly to the intended mood and setting.
    Question: Can you see subtle sea wave reflections in the background or on the table surface in the new scene?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
