**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is an elderly woman with short, wavy silver hair, wearing round glasses, seated in a deep red armchair. She is knitting a teal-colored scarf using wooden knitting needles. Her attire includes a light gray knitted cardigan over a white striped shirt and a red pleated skirt. The background features a dark wood bookshelf filled with books of various sizes and colors, suggesting a cozy study or library setting. To the right, there is a small wooden side table with a stack of books and a white teacup containing a warm beverage. A soft lampshade emits warm light from the upper right corner. On the left, a fireplace with visible flames adds warmth to the scene. The lighting is soft and golden, creating a tranquil, intimate atmosphere.

Thinking process:  
The editing instruction specifies several modifications:
- "Create a cozy-themed art card with the knitting lady in cartoon form" → This implies stylization (cartoon form), but not necessarily removal of core identity.
- "Enlarge the knitting needles" → This directly modifies the size of the knitting needles; they can be changed in scale.
- "Add steamy cup detail with swirling lines" → The teacup must be retained, but its content (steam) will be enhanced with visual effects.
- "Transform the quilt texture into yarn patterns" → This suggests that any existing quilt-like textures should be replaced with yarn patterns, so if such textures exist, they are modifiable.
- "Embed a writing panel with a knitted border and position in an open book with a soft lamplight illustration" → This introduces new elements (writing panel, open book, lamplight illustration), which may overlay or replace parts of the original scene.

From this, we infer:
- **Subject transformation**: The woman can be stylized into cartoon form, so her facial features, proportions, and style may change, but her core identity (elderly woman knitting) must remain.
- **Knitting needles**: Size can be enlarged — allowed change.
- **Teacup**: Must be present, but steam added — allowed modification of content/texture.
- **Quilt texture**: If present, it can be transformed into yarn patterns — allowed change.
- **Writing panel and open book**: New elements introduced — not required to retain original bookshelf or table layout, but their function as part of the scene may be repurposed.
- **Lamplight illustration**: Can be added or reimagined — does not require preservation of original lamp unless specified.

Allowed Changes List:
- Size of knitting needles
- Steam effect on teacup (swirling lines)
- Texture of any quilted or fabric surface (transformed into yarn patterns)
- Style of the entire image (to cartoon form)
- Addition of writing panel with knitted border
- Placement of open book with lamplight illustration
- Lighting tone (soft lamplight theme)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements must be preserved because they define the subject’s identity. The elderly woman is defined by:
- Her **silver wavy hair**, which is iconic for her age and appearance.
- Her **round glasses**, which are central to her facial identity.
- Her **knitting action** — the act of holding two needles and working on a scarf — this is essential to her role and purpose in the image.
- The **teal color of the scarf** — a distinct visual element tied to her activity.
- The **red armchair** — a key compositional anchor and symbolic of comfort.
- The **bookshelf background** — though potentially altered, it is part of the scene context and likely contributes to the "cozy library" theme, so it should remain recognizable even if stylized.

Functional/logical association elements:
- The **position of the hands** relative to the knitting needles and scarf must remain logical — she must still be actively knitting.
- The **relationship between the woman and the chair** — she must be seated, not standing or floating.
- The **placement of the teacup** on the side table — though steam may be added, its presence and location are important for continuity.

Non-modified element deduction:
After excluding changes like needle size, steam, texture, and style, the following must remain:
- The **woman’s face**, especially her expression (smiling gently), glasses, and hair shape.
- The **color and pattern of the scarf** (teal, ribbed knit).
- The **overall posture** — seated, leaning slightly forward, hands engaged in knitting.
- The **presence of the bookshelf** and **fireplace** — these are environmental anchors.
- The **side table** with books and cup — though possibly repositioned, it must be identifiable.

Preservation Targets List:
- The elderly woman's silver wavy hair
- The round glasses on her face
- The act of knitting with two wooden needles and a teal scarf
- The red armchair she is sitting in
- The bookshelf in the background
- The side table with stacked books and a white teacup
- The fireplace with visible flames on the left
- The woman’s smiling expression and overall posture

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

Q1:  
Thinking process: The silver wavy hair is a core identifier of the elderly woman. Its distinctive shape and color differentiate her from other characters. Changing it would make her unrecognizable. It is a unique feature that defines her identity in the image. Therefore, its retention is critical.  
Question: Is the woman’s hair silver in color and styled in short, wavy curls?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The round glasses are a defining facial feature, essential for recognizing her character. Removing or altering them would fundamentally change her appearance. They are part of her core identity and cannot be omitted without losing recognition.  
Question: Does the woman wear round-framed spectacles on her face?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The knitting action — hands holding two needles and manipulating a teal scarf — is the central activity and functional element of the image. Even if the needles are enlarged, the act of knitting must remain intact. Losing this would undermine the purpose of the scene.  
Question: Are the woman’s hands positioned to hold two knitting needles and work on a teal scarf?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The red armchair is a major compositional anchor and supports the “cozy” theme. Its color and form are distinctive and contribute to the scene’s warmth. Even in cartoon form, it must remain visually identifiable.  
Question: Is the woman seated in a large, deep red upholstered armchair?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The bookshelf behind her establishes the intellectual, homey environment. Though books may be rearranged or stylized, the shelf structure and presence of numerous books are essential to the scene’s identity. Removing it would destroy the setting.  
Question: Is there a dark wood bookshelf filled with multiple books visible behind the woman?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The side table with a stack of books and a white teacup is a key object group. While steam may be added, the cup and its placement must remain. It is a functional element tied to the cozy atmosphere.  
Question: Is there a small wooden side table next to the woman with a stack of books and a white teacup on it?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The fireplace on the left provides ambient warmth and lighting. Its presence contributes to the mood and spatial logic. Even if stylized, it must remain visible to preserve the scene’s coherence.  
Question: Is there a lit fireplace visible on the left side of the image, emitting flames?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q8:  
Thinking process: The woman’s expression — a gentle smile — is part of her emotional identity. It conveys warmth and contentment, reinforcing the cozy theme. Altering it could shift the mood significantly.  
Question: Is the woman smiling gently, showing a warm expression?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q9:  
Thinking process: The teal scarf has a distinct ribbed knit texture and color. It is the object being created, and its appearance is tied to the knitting activity. While texture may be altered, the color and general form must remain consistent.  
Question: Is the scarf being knitted a deep teal color with a ribbed knit pattern?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1
