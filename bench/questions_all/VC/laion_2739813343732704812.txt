Description of reference image: The subject is a pelican standing on a grassy surface, facing slightly to the left. It has a long, curved orange beak with a prominent gular pouch beneath it, which is light pink and textured with fine ridges. The pelican's head is covered in soft, fluffy gray feathers, with a tufted crest at the top. Its eyes are dark and round, set in a pale gray facial area. The neck is long and gracefully curved, leading into a body covered in layered gray feathers that transition from lighter shades on the chest to darker, more defined feather patterns on the wings and back. The wings are folded against the body, showing individual feather structure and subtle striping. The legs are short and pinkish, ending in webbed feet with visible claws. The background consists of green grass with patches of bare soil and scattered dry leaves, under bright natural daylight, casting soft shadows.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions word by word. The instruction states: "Transform the pelican into a cartoon-style magnet, exaggerating its beak and bulging eyes for comical charm." This indicates that the **form** of the pelican is to be changed—specifically, its beak and eyes are to be exaggerated, implying that their shape and proportion can be altered. “Use vivid pastels for its feathers” means color can change but implies texture may still be referenced. “Maintain the original texture” suggests that while colors shift, the **feather texture pattern** (i.e., layered, striated appearance) should remain recognizable. “Add a playful sailor hat atop its head” introduces a new element not present originally. “Set against a muted wooden plank background” explicitly replaces the current grassy scene. Therefore, the **subject’s form**, **color**, **background**, and **accessories** are allowed to change.

Allowed Changes List:
- Shape and size of the beak (exaggerated)
- Size and expression of the eyes (bulging)
- Feather color (changed to vivid pastels)
- Addition of a sailor hat
- Background (replaced with wooden planks)
- Overall style (transformed into cartoon magnet)
- Proportions (exaggerated for comical effect)

Step 2 - Determine the elements that should remain unchanged

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements: The pelican must remain identifiable as a pelican despite stylization. While its beak and eyes can be exaggerated, the **basic anatomical structure**—such as the presence of a large beak with a gular pouch, a long neck, and webbed feet—is essential for identity retention. However, since the instruction allows exaggeration, only those features that define the species beyond mere shape (e.g., **texture of feathers**) are critical. The instruction says “maintain the original texture,” so the **layered, striated feather pattern** must be preserved in form even if colored differently. This is a core identification feature because it distinguishes pelicans from other birds like herons or cranes.

Functional/logical association elements: None apply here—the pelican is not interacting with objects or environments in a functional way. The original setting (grass) is not logically tied to function, and the instruction explicitly replaces it.

Non-modified element deduction: After excluding all allowed changes, the following must remain:
- The **presence and structure of the gular pouch** beneath the beak (though possibly exaggerated, it must exist)
- The **webbed feet with visible claws** (as they are distinctive avian features)
- The **overall body silhouette** (long neck, broad body, folded wings)—this maintains bird-like anatomy
- The **feather texture** (striated, layered pattern) as per explicit instruction
- The **position of the legs and feet** relative to the body (standing posture)

Preservation Targets List:
- Presence and position of the gular pouch beneath the beak
- Webbed feet with visible claws
- Layered, striated feather texture
- Long neck and broad body silhouette
- Standing posture with legs positioned beneath the body

Q1:  
Thinking process: The gular pouch is a defining anatomical feature of pelicans, distinguishing them from other waterbirds. Its presence beneath the beak is crucial for species identification. Even if exaggerated in a cartoon style, its location and basic form must remain to preserve the pelican’s identity. Losing this would make the bird unrecognizable as a pelican. Hence, it is a core identity element.
Question: Is there a visible gular pouch located beneath the lower mandible of the beak?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: Webbed feet with visible claws are key identifiers of aquatic birds and are essential for confirming the pelican’s natural biology. Though the style may change, the presence of webbing and claw structure must remain to maintain biological accuracy within the stylized version. Their absence would suggest a non-bird or land-based creature, undermining authenticity.
Question: Are the feet clearly webbed with visible claws at the tips of each toe?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The instruction explicitly requires maintaining the original texture. The layered, striated feather pattern is a unique visual trait of real pelicans and contributes to their realistic appearance. Even with pastel colors, the underlying texture must be preserved to honor the original image’s detail and fulfill the edit’s requirement. Losing this would result in a smooth or flat-feathered bird, altering its fundamental look.
Question: Are the feathers on the body composed of layered, striated structures with visible individual feather shafts and overlapping edges?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The long neck and broad body silhouette are essential for identifying the bird as a pelican rather than a crane or stork. While proportions may be exaggerated, the general shape must remain consistent to avoid misidentification. This silhouette is a core structural feature that supports recognition.
Question: Does the bird have a long neck curving down from the head to a broad, rounded body?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The standing posture with legs positioned directly beneath the body is a natural stance for pelicans and contributes to spatial logic. Changing this could imply an unnatural pose or floating state, disrupting the sense of balance and realism. While the style may be cartoonish, the basic weight distribution must remain.
Question: Are both legs positioned under the body, supporting the pelican in a grounded standing pose?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The eye is a key facial feature, though the instruction allows bulging. However, the **presence** of a single dark, round eye must remain—even if enlarged—to retain facial structure. Removing or replacing it entirely (e.g., with a cartoon dot) would violate biological consistency unless specified. Since the instruction does not remove it, it must be preserved.
Question: Is there a single dark, round eye visible on the side of the head?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The tufted crest on the head is a minor but distinct morphological detail that adds character to the pelican’s appearance. While not essential for identification, it contributes to visual coherence and realism. If removed without replacement, it would reduce fidelity to the original.
Question: Is there a small tuft of feathers raised at the crown of the head?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1
