Description of reference image: The subject is a navy blue soft-shell suitcase with a textured fabric surface featuring fine diagonal ribbing. It has a rectangular form with rounded corners and black trim outlining the edges. A retractable telescopic handle made of silver metal with a black ergonomic grip extends from the top. A secondary top carry handle is integrated into the upper lid, also in black. The front panel features a large zippered pocket with dual silver-toned zippers and a subtle logo patch near the top center—a small black square emblem with a white stylized "T" and the brand name "TUMI" beneath it. On the right side, there is a vertical black grab handle secured with rivets. The base includes four multi-directional spinner wheels, each with a dark gray hub and black outer casing, mounted on black plastic wheel housings. The overall design emphasizes durability, modernity, and functionality, with clean lines and structured stitching defining the panels.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions that clearly state what can be changed:  
- "Transform the suitcase into a premium travel brand's flagship perfume bottle" → implies complete transformation of the object’s form and function.  
- "Reshape the case into a tall, rectangular glass vessel" → indicates the shape and material are to be altered.  
- "Incorporate retractable handle as a metallic spray nozzle" → the handle is repurposed but its structural identity may be retained in transformed form.  
- "Replace fabric panels with translucent purple-tinted sections" → material and color of surface panels change.  
- "Retaining seam details as embossed linear patterns" → this specifies that **seam lines** must be preserved in a new form (embossed), not removed.  
- "Add an elegant logo etched near the top" → introduces a new element, but suggests the original logo may be repositioned or transformed.  
- "Convert wheels into decorative caps for aesthetic balance" → wheels are to be replaced in function but possibly kept in position or form as decorative elements.  

From this, we infer:  
- The **overall structure and layout** of the suitcase (e.g., front pocket, side handle, bottom placement) may be reinterpreted in the new form.  
- **Material** (fabric → glass), **color** (navy blue → purple-tinted), and **function** (luggage → perfume bottle) are explicitly allowed to change.  
- **Seam details** are specifically mentioned to be retained as embossed patterns — so their **presence and linearity** must be preserved.  
- The **logo** is referenced again ("add an elegant logo"), suggesting the original logo’s **identity** may be retained but **transformed** (etched instead of stitched).  
- The **retractable handle** is to become a **spray nozzle**, implying its **mechanical presence and central location** are preserved, though form changes.  
- The **wheels** are to become **decorative caps**, meaning their **placement at the base** and **number** may remain, but their **functional role** is lost.  

Allowed Changes List:  
- Overall shape (soft suitcase → tall glass vessel)  
- Material (textured fabric → translucent glass)  
- Color (navy blue → purple-tinted)  
- Function (luggage → perfume bottle)  
- Wheels (functional spinner wheels → decorative caps)  
- Handle (retractable mechanism → metallic spray nozzle)  
- Fabric panels (replaced by glass)  
- Logo (stitched patch → etched design)  

Step 2 – Determine the elements that should remain unchanged

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements:  
The original image is a recognizable TUMI suitcase. Its core identity lies in its **design language**: the **structured paneling**, **diagonal texture**, **dual-zipper front pocket**, **top and side handles**, **four-wheel configuration**, and **distinctive logo placement**. However, the instruction allows transformation of most of these. The only **explicitly required retention** is the **seam details**, which are to be preserved as **embossed linear patterns**. This means the **pattern of seams** (their shape, direction, and arrangement) must remain visually identifiable, even if rendered differently.  

Functional/logical association elements:  
The **retractable handle** is repurposed as a **spray nozzle**, but its **central top location** and **vertical orientation** are likely preserved due to functional logic—nozzle placement on a perfume bottle is typically at the top. Thus, while form changes, **spatial position and axis alignment** must be retained. Similarly, the **wheels** are converted into **decorative caps**, implying they remain at the **base corners** in **same number and relative positions**, preserving the **structural symmetry** of the object.  

Non-modified element deduction:  
Although the material and color change, the **original seam pattern** is explicitly instructed to be retained in transformed form. Therefore, the **visual path and geometry of the seams** (e.g., horizontal, vertical, curved contours around pockets) must be preserved. Additionally, the **logo**, though changed in medium (from stitched patch to etched), must retain its **identity and approximate location** (near top center), as it is part of the brand’s signature. The **front pocket** is not directly mentioned, but since it is a key feature of the original design and its **zipper tracks** are part of the seam network, they must be retained in some form.  

Preservation Targets List:  
- Seam pattern (shape, direction, and layout)  
- Logo placement (near top center)  
- Retractable handle position (top center, vertical)  
- Wheel count and base positioning (four wheels at corners)  
- Front pocket outline and zipper track paths

    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The seam details are explicitly instructed to be retained as embossed linear patterns. These seams define the structural segmentation of the suitcase, including the contour of the front pocket, the vertical division between panels, and the edge outlines. Their geometric layout is a core visual identifier of the suitcase's design language. If lost, the transformed object would lack the original’s structural character, making it unrecognizable as derived from the original. Hence, the presence and alignment of the seam lines are critical.
    Question: Are the original seam lines (including those around the front pocket and vertical panel divisions) preserved as embossed linear patterns on the transformed glass vessel?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The logo is a key brand identifier. Although the instruction says to "add an elegant logo etched near the top," it implies the original logo’s identity and position should be maintained. The original logo is located near the top center of the front panel. Changing its position or omitting it entirely would break brand continuity and visual coherence. Therefore, the logo must appear in approximately the same location, even if transformed.
    Question: Is the brand logo positioned near the top center of the front face of the transformed object?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The retractable handle is repurposed as a spray nozzle, but its function and spatial role suggest it must remain at the top center of the object. The original handle is vertically aligned and centrally placed. Removing or relocating it would disrupt the logical transformation from luggage to perfume bottle, where the nozzle must be at the top. Thus, the handle’s position and vertical orientation must be preserved.
    Question: Is the metallic spray nozzle located at the top center of the object, aligned vertically with the original handle’s position?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The original suitcase has four spinner wheels at the base corners. The instruction states to convert them into decorative caps, implying their number and placement must be preserved for structural balance. Losing one or altering their position would break symmetry and visual consistency with the original object’s footprint. Thus, the count and corner-based positioning are essential.
    Question: Are four decorative caps present at the base corners of the transformed object, corresponding to the original wheel positions?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The front pocket is defined by two parallel zipper tracks and a distinct rectangular outline formed by seams. While the material changes, the instruction to retain seam details implies the pocket’s outline and zipper paths must be preserved in form. The dual-zipper configuration is a unique detail of the original design, contributing to its identity. Omitting or altering it would reduce fidelity.
    Question: Are the two zipper tracks of the front pocket preserved as linear features on the transformed object, maintaining their parallel alignment and position within the front panel?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The side handle is a functional feature located on the right side of the suitcase. While not explicitly mentioned in the transformation, its presence contributes to the object’s symmetry and usability. Since the wheels are being preserved in position, and the handle is part of the lateral profile, it is reasonable to assume it is either transformed or retained in place. However, the instruction does not mention it, so its retention is not mandatory. But given the emphasis on symmetry and structural balance, its absence would create imbalance. Thus, it is a minor but important detail.
    Question: Is a handle present on the right side of the transformed object, corresponding to the original side handle’s position?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
