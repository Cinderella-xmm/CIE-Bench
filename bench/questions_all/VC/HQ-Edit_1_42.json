If this action is omitted or replaced (e.g., with a tablet or closed book), the core identity of the scene is lost. The hands must be positioned on the paper, and the head angled toward it. This is a functional and behavioral core element.",

Even in cartoon form, it must retain the visual characteristics of a newspaper: folded pages, columns of text, and possibly images. If it becomes a magazine, book, or abstract shape, the narrative breaks. The title \"BLOOMSBURY EVENING JOURNAL\" is not required to be preserved, but the general format must be.",

Removing it or replacing it with another item (e.g., umbrella, briefcase) would alter the scene’s authenticity and consistency.

Their color (red, orange, yellow) and shape (maple-like) are essential to the seasonal theme. Even if swirling, they must retain these characteristics.
