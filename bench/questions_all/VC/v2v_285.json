      "thinking_process": "The tree trunk is a core structural and compositional element. Its presence and position on the left side of the image are essential for anchoring the scene and providing scale. If removed or relocated, the entire composition would lose its balance and narrative context. The texture and thickness of the bark are also important for identifying it as a mature tree, which contributes to the vintage atmosphere. This is a key identity feature of the scene, so its retention is critical.",
      "question": "Is the large tree trunk with textured bark positioned on the left side of the image, partially obscuring the rear wheel of the bicycle?",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The bicycle’s physical contact with the tree trunk is a functional and logical element. Even if the bicycle is stylized, it must still appear to lean against the tree. This interaction defines the scene’s stillness and narrative. Removing or altering this support relationship would break the visual logic of the image.",
      "question": "Does the bicycle make direct contact with the tree trunk, leaning against it on its left side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The dirt road is a key environmental element that defines the setting and leads the viewer’s eye into the background. Although the surface may be changed to a flower path, the road’s linear extension from foreground to background must remain. Its absence or reorientation would disrupt the depth and perspective of the scene.",
      "question": "Is there a continuous road stretching from the foreground into the background, aligned horizontally across the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The three motorcyclists in a line are a defining feature of the background. Their arrangement contributes to the sense of motion and depth. Even if replaced with chibi versions, their number and linear formation must be preserved to maintain the original scene’s rhythm and narrative.",
      "question": "Are there exactly three motorcyclists riding in a straight line along the road in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The spatial layout—bicycle on the left, tree behind it, road to the right, and motorcyclists receding into the distance—is essential for visual coherence. This composition establishes the scene’s balance and storytelling. Altering the relative positions would fundamentally change the image’s meaning.",
      "question": "Is the bicycle located on the left side of the image, with the road and motorcyclists positioned to the right and extending into the distance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The rear wheel of the bicycle is partially hidden behind the tree trunk, creating a specific visual cue about scale and depth. This detail is not just decorative but contributes to the realism and composition. Even if the bicycle is stylized, this occlusion must be preserved to maintain the original spatial relationship.",
      "question": "Is the rear wheel of the bicycle partially obscured by the tree trunk?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The presence of the headlight on the front of the bicycle is a distinctive feature of its vintage design. While the style may change, the headlight’s position and function as a front-mounted light source must be retained to preserve the bicycle’s identity as a classic model.",
      "question": "Is there a round headlight mounted on the front fork of the bicycle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
