Description of reference image: The subject is a highly detailed, ornate silver teapot sculpted in the form of an elephant, standing upright on four legs. The elephant’s head forms the front of the teapot, with its trunk curving upward and backward to serve as the spout. The ears are large and flared, and the eyes are deeply carved with expressive detail. The body of the teapot is intricately engraved with floral patterns, including lotus blossoms, leaves, and vines, covering the entire surface. The lid is domed and topped with a pointed finial resembling a miniature stupa or knob. A curved handle extends from the back of the teapot, also adorned with embossed patterns. The teapot rests on a smooth, cream-colored fabric draped over a table, creating soft folds and highlights. To the left of the teapot is a matching silver cup and saucer, both featuring similar engraved designs. The cup has a small handle and sits on a flat circular saucer. A spoon lies beside it, partially visible. The background is a neutral dark gray, providing contrast and emphasizing the metallic sheen of the objects. Lighting is directional, casting subtle shadows and enhancing the three-dimensional texture of the metalwork.

Thinking process:  
First, analyze the editing instructions word by word:  
- "Transform the intricate elephant teapot into a miniature diorama within a curved glass dome" → This indicates that the **form** of the teapot is being changed (from standalone object to enclosed diorama), so the **physical structure** of the teapot can be altered. However, the **identity** of the object (an elephant-shaped teapot) must still be recognizable.  
- "Stylize it with steampunk elements, adding gears and copper accents" → Allows modification of surface design; **gears and copper** are new additions, so original decorative motifs may be altered or overlaid.  
- "Base: Simulate wooden floorboards topped with scattered tea leaves and tiny silver utensils" → The **base** environment is being replaced, so the original cloth-covered table is no longer required.  
- "Dome: Embed soft moss accents in the base, enhance the elephant's trunk with steam effects, and surround the scene with intricate, vine-like metalwork" → Introduces **new environmental and visual effects**, including **steam from the trunk**, **moss**, and **metalwork framing**, which are not present in the original.  

Thus, allowed changes include:
- The **overall form** of the teapot (now inside a dome)
- **Surface design** (addition of gears, copper)
- **Base environment** (replaced with wooden floorboards, tea leaves, utensils)
- **Addition of steam** from the trunk
- **Addition of moss and vine-like metalwork**
- **Replacement of cloth table** with diorama setting

Allowed Changes List:
- The physical form of the teapot (now part of a diorama)
- Surface decoration (addition of steampunk elements like gears and copper)
- Base platform (changed from cloth to wooden floorboards with scattered items)
- Environmental lighting and effects (steam from trunk, moss, metalwork)
- Background and surrounding scene (replaced with glass dome and internal diorama details)

Step 2 – Determine the elements that should remain unchanged  
Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements: The **elephant-shaped teapot** is the central identity of the image. Even with steampunk stylization, the **basic shape** of the elephant—its head, trunk, ears, legs, and body—must remain identifiable. The **trunk as spout**, **handle on the back**, and **domed lid** are essential for recognizing it as a teapot shaped like an elephant. These are core identity features. If the elephant form is lost, the object cannot be recognized as such.

Functional/logical association elements: The **teapot function** is implied by the presence of a spout (trunk), lid, and handle. Even if stylized, the **functional relationship** between these parts must be preserved: the trunk must remain connected to the body and serve as the outlet. The **lid must still sit atop the body**, and the **handle must extend from the rear**. These are logical necessities for a teapot, regardless of style.

Non-modified element deduction: After excluding allowed changes, the following must remain:
- The **presence of the elephant head** with **large ears and expressive eyes**
- The **curved trunk** forming the spout
- The **four-legged stance** of the elephant
- The **domed lid with finial**
- The **floral engraving pattern** (even if overlaid with gears, the underlying motif should still be visible or traceable)
- The **silver color and metallic texture** (unless explicitly replaced; but instruction does not say so, only adds copper accents)

These elements are not mentioned as changeable and are essential for maintaining the original subject's identity.

Preservation Targets List:  
- The elephant’s head with large ears and expressive eyes  
- The trunk forming the spout  
- The four-legged stance of the elephant  
- The domed lid with finial  
- The floral engraving patterns on the body  
- The overall silver metallic texture  
- The presence of the matching cup and saucer (though possibly scaled down)  
- The functional layout: spout (trunk), handle, lid, body

    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The key identification feature of this teapot is the **elephant’s head**, particularly the **large, flared ears** and **expressive eye**, which distinguish it from other animal-shaped teapots. These are core visual identifiers that define the subject’s identity. If the ears are removed or altered beyond recognition, the teapot would no longer be identifiable as elephant-shaped. Thus, their presence and form are critical.
    Question: Is the elephant’s head with large, flared ears and visible eye clearly present?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The **trunk serving as the spout** is a defining functional and structural feature. It connects the head to the body and curves upward, forming the outlet. This is not just decorative—it defines the object’s purpose as a teapot. Any transformation must preserve this spatial and functional relationship. Losing the trunk-as-spout would break the identity of the object.
    Question: Is the trunk of the elephant clearly formed into the spout of the teapot, extending upward and backward?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The **four-legged stance** is essential to the elephant’s anatomical form. Even if stylized, the legs must support the body and maintain the weight-bearing posture of an elephant. Altering or removing them would fundamentally change the creature’s identity and make it unrecognizable as an elephant.
    Question: Are four distinct legs supporting the body of the elephant-teapot?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The **domed lid with a pointed finial** is a distinctive architectural feature of the teapot. It sits atop the body and completes the vessel’s form. Its presence is crucial for identifying the object as a teapot, even if the rest is stylized. Removing or altering the lid would disrupt the functional closure of the teapot.
    Question: Is there a domed lid with a pointed finial on top of the teapot?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The **floral engraving patterns** (especially lotus and vine motifs) cover the body and are a hallmark of the original design. While the instruction allows steampunk modifications, the **underlying decorative style** must still be recognizable. If the floral patterns are completely erased or obscured, the artistic identity of the piece is lost. Their presence ensures continuity with the original aesthetic.
    Question: Are floral patterns, including lotus flowers and vines, visibly engraved on the body of the teapot?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The **silver metallic texture** is fundamental to the material identity of the object. While copper accents may be added, the base material remains silver. The reflective, polished surface is a key visual characteristic. Changing it entirely (e.g., to matte black) would alter the perceived material and diminish authenticity.
    Question: Is the teapot primarily rendered in a silver metallic finish with reflective highlights?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The **matching cup and saucer** are part of the original composition and contribute to the tea-serving context. Though they may be resized or repositioned in the diorama, their **presence** is important for maintaining the narrative of a tea set. Their removal would break the thematic coherence.
    Question: Is a matching silver cup and saucer present next to the teapot?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
