Description of reference image: The subject is a clear glass bottle of Bacardi Mojito, filled with a pale green liquid. The bottle has a classic curved silhouette with a narrow neck and a wide body, typical of cocktail bottles. It features a bright green screw-cap with the word "MOJITO" printed in white uppercase letters on a black band below it, and the phrase "READY TO SERVE" beneath that. The label is cream-colored with gold trim and centered around the iconic Bacardi bat logo—a red circle with a black bat inside—surrounded by the text "LA CASA DEL MURCIÉLAGO" (The House of the Bat) arched above and "Est. 1862" below. The brand name "BACARDÍ" is prominently displayed in bold black serif font, followed by "CLASSIC COCKTAILS" in smaller black text. Below this, "MOJITO" is written in large, bold green sans-serif letters. Beneath the product name, the tagline "CREATED WITH BACARDÍ SUPERIOR RUM" appears in small black print, along with the signature "Facundo Bacardí" in cursive script. At the bottom of the label, there's an illustration of a mint leaf, and text specifying "natural mint flavor, lime juice, cane sugar," along with alcohol content ("15% ALC. BY VOL. (30 PROOF)") and serving instruction: "Simply pour over ice." The background is pure white, with no shadows or additional elements, emphasizing the product.

Thinking process:  
First, analyze the editing instructions to determine what can be changed. The instruction explicitly states:  
- Transform the Bacardi Mojito bottle into a LEGO structure → **entire form of the subject can be reimagined as LEGO**, so the physical material and texture are changeable.  
- Use translucent green bricks for the glass body → **color and translucency of the body are specified but not required to match original glass exactly**; thus, color and material may be altered within the LEGO aesthetic.  
- Multicolored blocks for the label design → **label’s visual content can be recreated using colored blocks**, meaning layout and text can be reconstructed in block form, but must remain legible.  
- Construct the cap from smooth, circular blue bricks → **cap shape and cylindrical form must be preserved, but color changes from green to blue**; therefore, **color of cap is allowed to change**, but **form must remain cylindrical**.  
- Arrange on a minimalist white shelf → **background scene is changed from plain white to a shelf**, so **original background is not retained**.  

Thus, allowed changes include:  
- Material (glass → LEGO bricks)  
- Color of cap (green → blue)  
- Texture (smooth glass → brick surface)  
- Background (white void → white shelf)  
- Label construction method (paper → LEGO blocks), though content must remain readable  

Allowed Changes List:  
- Material of the bottle body (from glass to translucent green LEGO bricks)  
- Cap color (from green to blue)  
- Texture of the bottle (from smooth glass to LEGO brick surface)  
- Background (from plain white to minimalist white shelf)  
- Construction method of the label (from printed paper to multicolored LEGO blocks)  
- Shape of the cap (must remain cylindrical, but made of smooth circular bricks)  

Step 2 – Determine the elements that should remain unchanged  
Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements:  
- The **Bacardi bat logo** is a globally recognized trademark and central identity element. Even if built from LEGO, its shape, position, and symbolic red-black color scheme must be preserved for brand recognition.  
- The **wording “BACARDÍ”** in bold black serif font is essential for brand identification. Its placement, font style, and capitalization must be maintained.  
- The **product name “MOJITO”** in green sans-serif font is critical for identifying the variant. Its color and placement must be preserved.  
- The **signature “Facundo Bacardí”** is a distinctive branding element associated with authenticity and heritage.  
- The **mint leaf icon** at the bottom of the label is a key flavor indicator and visual cue. Its presence and general shape must be retained.  
- The **text “natural mint flavor, lime juice, cane sugar”** and **“Simply pour over ice”** convey functional information and must remain legible.  
- The **alcohol content “15% ALC. BY VOL.”** is a regulatory and informational detail that must be preserved.  

Functional/logical association elements:  
- The **bottle shape** must retain its general silhouette (curved body, narrow neck) to maintain the recognizable form of a cocktail bottle. While constructed from LEGO, its proportions and outline must align with the original.  
- The **label’s layout** must preserve the hierarchical structure: logo at top, brand name, product name, signature, ingredients, and instructions — to ensure readability and logical flow.  
- The **position of the cap** must remain at the top of the neck, maintaining the correct spatial relationship between cap and bottle.  

Non-modified element deduction:  
After excluding allowed changes (material, texture, cap color, background), all other **visual details tied to brand identity, product labeling, and structural integrity** must be preserved. These include:  
- The **bat logo’s specific design** (black bat with wings spread, red circle, stylized eyes)  
- The **font styles and sizes** of key text elements  
- The **relative positioning** of all label components  
- The **presence of the mint leaf** and **ingredient list**  
- The **overall proportion and curvature** of the bottle  

Preservation Targets List:  
- The Bacardi bat logo (shape, red circle, black bat)  
- The word “BACARDÍ” in bold black serif font  
- The word “MOJITO” in green sans-serif font  
- The signature “Facundo Bacardí” in cursive script  
- The mint leaf icon  
- The ingredient text: “natural mint flavor, lime juice, cane sugar”  
- The instruction “Simply pour over ice”  
- The alcohol content label: “15% ALC. BY VOL.”  
- The general silhouette and proportions of the bottle (curved body, narrow neck)  
- The cylindrical form of the cap  
- The label’s layout hierarchy (logo → brand → product → signature → ingredients → instructions)
