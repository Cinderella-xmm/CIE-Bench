**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

Description of reference image:  
The subject is a bonsai tree with a compact, intricately branched structure, featuring small green leaves and numerous pinkish-red flower buds distributed across its branches. The trunk is dark brown and gnarled, showing natural texture and curvature typical of cultivated bonsai. The plant is potted in a wide, shallow, teal-colored ceramic pot filled with dark soil and some visible root matter. A small white tea light candle rests on the black surface to the left of the pot. The background is plain and uniformly light gray, providing high contrast to the bonsai and emphasizing its form. The lighting is soft and even, casting subtle shadows beneath the pot and highlighting the texture of the bark and foliage.

Thinking process:  
The editing instruction explicitly transforms the bonsai into an *enchanted woodland sprite*, which indicates that the **form and identity** of the bonsai are to be fundamentally altered. Specific transformations include:
- Branches becoming **delicate butterfly wings** with **luminescent patterns**
- **Glowing pink blossoms** as **eyes and antlers**
- The **pot** morphing into an **ancient stone base** with **intricate carvings**
- The **trunk** gaining **bark-like textures mimicking flowing robes**

These changes suggest that the **overall shape, function, and symbolic meaning** of the bonsai are being reimagined into a fantasy entity. However, the instruction does not mention altering or removing any specific **visual elements from the original image** such as the **position of the candle**, the **color of the pot’s exterior**, or the **general layout** of the scene (e.g., black table, neutral background). It also does not state that the **original composition** should be abandoned—only that the **subject** should be transformed.

Thus, while the **subject's form** is allowed to change dramatically, **scene context and certain background/auxiliary elements** may still need to be preserved for consistency unless otherwise specified.

Allowed Changes List:
- The **shape and structure** of the bonsai branches (to become butterfly wings)
- The **function and appearance** of the flower buds (to become eyes and antlers)
- The **material and design** of the pot (to become a carved stone base)
- The **texture and visual metaphor** of the trunk (to resemble flowing robes)
- The **lighting effect** (to include luminescence and glow)
- The **overall symbolic identity** of the bonsai (from plant to sprite)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements must be identified based on what makes the original image uniquely identifiable. Even though the bonsai is being transformed, certain **physical attributes** of the original object and scene are not mentioned in the transformation and thus should remain unchanged unless implied by the edit.

- **Core recognition elements**: The bonsai itself is defined by its **small size, dense foliage, and structured branching pattern**. However, since the instruction explicitly states it will be transformed into a sprite, the **biological identity** of the bonsai can be altered. But **its position in space**, **the presence of the pot**, and **the surrounding environment** are not described as changed—so these must be retained for continuity.
- **Functional/logical association elements**: The **candle** is placed beside the pot and appears to serve a compositional or ambient role. Since it is not mentioned in the instructions, its **presence, position, and form** should be preserved to maintain logical coherence of the scene.
- **Non-modified element deduction**: While the **tree's form** is to be changed, the **original container** (teal pot), **soil**, **table surface**, and **background** are not specified for alteration. Therefore, their **existence, color, and placement** should remain intact unless they are integrated into the new design. For example, if the pot becomes a stone base, its **original location and general silhouette** might still be preserved, but its **material** changes. Thus, **spatial relationships** must be maintained.

Preservation Targets List:
- The **presence and position** of the white tea light candle on the left side of the pot
- The **black flat surface** on which the pot and candle rest
- The **plain light gray background** behind the bonsai
- The **original placement and orientation** of the bonsai within the frame (centered, upright)
- The **teal color and general shape** of the pot (even if material changes, its visual footprint remains)
- The **soil and root matter** visible at the top of the pot (as part of the planting medium)

Note: Although the pot’s material may change, its **size, shape, and position** are likely intended to remain consistent for visual grounding. Similarly, the **candle’s presence** supports scene authenticity and scale.

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

Q1:  
Thinking process: The white tea light candle is a distinct object in the lower-left corner of the image. Its presence contributes to the scene’s realism and scale. Since it is not mentioned in the editing instruction, it should remain unaltered. Removing it would disrupt the spatial logic and reduce visual coherence. This is a minor but identifiable detail, so it is assigned a weight of 1 point.  
Question: Is the white tea light candle present on the black surface to the left of the bonsai pot?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1

Q2:  
Thinking process: The black surface serves as the base for both the bonsai and the candle. It provides contrast and defines the foreground. The instruction does not mention changing the surface, so it must remain unchanged. Altering its color or texture would affect the overall balance and realism of the scene. This is a key environmental element, hence 2 points.  
Question: Is the bonsai and candle resting on a flat black surface?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2

Q3:  
Thinking process: The light gray background is essential for isolating the subject and ensuring focus. It is not referenced in the transformation, so it should remain untouched. Changing it could shift the mood or distract from the central figure. As a core scene element, it is vital for consistency and earns 2 points.  
Question: Is the background uniformly light gray with no visible patterns or objects?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2

Q4:  
Thinking process: The teal-colored pot is a defining feature of the original image. While the instruction says it should become a stone base, its **position, size, and general shape** must be preserved for continuity. If it were moved or resized drastically, the edited image would lose its anchor. Thus, its **visual footprint** is critical. This is a core functional element, earning 3 points.  
Question: Is the bonsai planted in a wide, shallow, teal-colored ceramic pot that occupies the center of the image?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3

Q5:  
Thinking process: The soil and visible root matter at the top of the pot are part of the bonsai’s planting detail. They contribute to the realism of the plant’s presentation. Though the tree may become magical, the **soil layer** should remain visible and undisturbed unless explicitly replaced. This is a minor but important detail that supports authenticity. Weight: 1.  
Question: Are dark soil and exposed root matter visible at the surface of the pot?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1

Q6:  
Thinking process: The bonsai’s **upright posture and centered composition** are fundamental to its visual identity in the original image. Even after transformation, the **spatial arrangement** should remain consistent to preserve the viewer’s sense of orientation. Moving or tilting the tree would break the original framing. This is a key compositional element, so it is worth 2 points.  
Question: Is the bonsai positioned centrally and upright in the frame?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2
