      "thinking_process": "The white hair and mustache are the most distinctive facial features of the elderly man, serving as core identity markers. Their absence or alteration would make the character unrecognizable, especially since the narrative centers on his wisdom. This is a 3-point element due to its irreplaceable role in identifying the subject.",
      "question": "Is the elderly man depicted with white hair and a white mustache?",

      "thinking_process": "The rubber duck chess pieces are the defining feature of the narrative. The green, pink, and yellow ducks are uniquely shaped and colored, forming a functional chess set. Their retention ensures the story of \"Duck Chessmaster\" remains intact. Losing any key duck or changing its form would break the concept.",
      "question": "Are the chess pieces composed of rubber ducks in green, pink, and yellow colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The chessboard’s grid pattern and its position beneath the ducks are essential for establishing the game context. The board’s presence and structure define the activity being performed. Altering or removing it would destroy the functional logic of the scene.",
      "question": "Is the chessboard visible beneath the duck pieces, with a green-and-brown checkered pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The man’s posture—seated, leaning forward with arms crossed—establishes his engagement and contemplative mood. This pose is critical to portraying him as a wise figure involved in thought. Changing it would misrepresent his demeanor and weaken the narrative.",
      "question": "Is the man seated with his arms crossed and leaning slightly forward toward the board?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The reflective pond behind the table provides depth and serenity, reinforcing the tranquil environment. Its presence and approximate shape are important for maintaining scene coherence and supporting the \"wise elder in nature\" theme. While stylized, it must remain visually identifiable.",
      "question": "Is there a reflective pond visible directly behind the table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The kimono’s silhouette and fold lines contribute to cultural authenticity and character identity. While texture may change in woodblock style, the garment’s shape and wrapping pattern must remain consistent to preserve the traditional appearance.",
      "question": "Does the man wear a traditional kimono with visible fold lines and layered sleeves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The isolated yellow duck on the far right of the board serves as a visual focal point and likely represents the king or final piece. Its position and distinct color make it a key narrative element. Moving or replacing it would alter the game’s implied structure.",
      "question": "Is there a single yellow duck standing alone on the rightmost square of the board?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question": "Are large trees visible in the background, partially framing the scene on both sides?",
