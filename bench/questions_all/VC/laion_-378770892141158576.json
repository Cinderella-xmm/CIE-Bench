Although the instruction allows stylization (e.g., cartoon form), the hairstyle (short and dark) is not specified to be changed, making it a core identifier of the individual. Losing this feature would make the character unrecognizable as the same person. Therefore, it is a key identity element with weight 3.",

This positioning defines the spatial relationship between the subject and the environment. Even though the posture changes to seated, the location at the lake’s edge must be preserved to maintain logical continuity. Thus, the shoreline setting is critical and worth 2 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The lake reflects the surrounding mountains in the original image, creating a mirror-like effect. This reflection is a defining visual characteristic of the scene, contributing to the sense of serenity and symmetry. Although the instruction allows different lake views, the presence of a reflective surface in a mountainous alpine setting must remain to preserve the intended atmosphere. Hence, this is an important scene element worth 2 points.",

These flowers are visually distinctive and contribute to the natural beauty of the scene. While the artistic style may change, their presence helps ground the image in a real-world alpine meadow. Their retention supports visual coherence, making them a secondary but important detail worth 1 point.",

These rocks are not mentioned as being removed or altered, so they must be preserved to maintain environmental accuracy. Their presence supports the realism of the setting, even if stylized.

Even if the posture changes to seated, the direction of gaze (toward the lake) must remain consistent to preserve narrative logic. This is a functional spatial relationship critical to the scene’s meaning, thus worth 2 points.",

While the instruction allows different lake views, the general setting of mountains surrounding a lake must remain to maintain thematic consistency. The presence of high-altitude terrain with snow remnants is a key environmental marker, supporting the alpine identity of the scene. This is an important contextual element worth 2 points.",
