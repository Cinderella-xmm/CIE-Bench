Description of reference image: The subject is a skateboard leaning against a kitchen cabinet. The skateboard has a black grip tape surface with visible screw holes and orange wheels. The kitchen features a stainless steel sink with a modern faucet, a granite countertop, wooden cabinets with silver handles, and a green dish soap bottle placed near the sink. The background consists of white tiled walls and beige tiled flooring.

### Step 1 - Allowed Changes List:

Thinking process: The instructions specify transforming the image into a stained-glass style with vivid geometric designs outlining the skateboard, sink, and cabinets. This implies changes to the color palette, addition of geometric outlines, and a shift towards a more artistic representation. However, the core forms and positions of the skateboard, sink, and cabinets must remain recognizable.

Allowed Changes List:
Specific element 1 that allows for changes: Color palette transformation to mimic stained glass.
Specific element 2 that allows for changes: Addition of geometric outlines and patterns.
Specific element 3 that allows for changes: Adjustment of lighting and shadows to fit the stained-glass aesthetic.

### Step 2 - Preservation Targets List:

Thinking process: Core recognition elements include the distinct shape and orientation of the skateboard, the recognizable form of the kitchen sink and cabinets, and their spatial arrangement. Functional/logical associations involve the skateboard leaning against the cabinet and the sink's placement on the countertop. Remaining elements like the tile patterns and cabinet handles contribute to visual coherence.

Preservation Targets List:
(Element 1 that should be maintained): The skateboard's shape and orientation.
(Element 2 that should be maintained): The sink's form and position relative to the countertop.
(Element 3 that should be maintained): The cabinets' structure and arrangement.
(Element 4 that should be maintained): The spatial relationship between the skateboard and the cabinets.
(Element 5 that should be maintained): The tile patterns on the floor and wall.

### Step 3 - Question Generation:

Q1:  
Thinking process: The skateboard's shape is crucial for recognition. Losing this would make it unidentifiable as a skateboard, impacting core identity.
Question: Is the skateboard's distinct elongated rectangular shape with rounded ends retained?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
Weight: 3

Q2:  
Thinking process: The sink's form is essential for recognizing the kitchen setting. Altering it would disrupt the scene's logic.
Question: Is the stainless steel sink's oval shape and placement on the countertop retained?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
Weight: 3

Q3:  
Thinking process: The cabinets' structure is vital for maintaining the kitchen's identity. Changing this would affect the scene's coherence.
Question: Are the wooden cabinets with silver handles and their arrangement retained?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
Weight: 2

Q4:  
Thinking process: The spatial relationship ensures the logical placement of objects. Disrupting this would undermine the scene's realism.
Question: Is the skateboard still leaning against the cabinet in the same position?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
Weight: 2

Q5:  
Thinking process: The tile patterns provide context and detail, contributing to the scene's authenticity. Losing them would slightly affect visual consistency.
Question: Are the beige tile patterns on the floor and white tile patterns on the wall retained?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
Weight: 1

Important Reminder: Each question focuses on a single visual feature critical for maintaining the image's identity and coherence post-editing.
