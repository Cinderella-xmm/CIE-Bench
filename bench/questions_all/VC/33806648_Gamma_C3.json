      "thinking_process": "The fallen log is a distinct, physically present object in the foreground that contributes to the scene’s realism and scale. Its presence is not referenced in the editing instructions, meaning it should remain unaltered. Removing or modifying it would disrupt the visual balance and spatial grounding of the scene. It is a minor but identifiable detail that supports the original environment’s authenticity.",
      "question": "Is the fallen log still present in the foreground, lying diagonally across the cave floor?",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The direction of sunlight entering through the arch is a core element of the original image’s lighting dynamics. The instructions do not state that the light source should be altered, so the sunlit area on the right side of the arch and the shadow cast on the left must remain consistent. Changing this would break the logical relationship between the interior and exterior environments.",
      "question": "Does sunlight still enter from the arch opening and illuminate the right side of the cave interior?",

      "thinking_process": "The rocky ground surface beneath the arch is a foundational element of the scene. It defines the terrain and provides continuity between the foreground and background. Since the instructions focus only on transforming the arch and not the floor, this surface must remain intact. Altering it would undermine the physical consistency of the environment.",
      "question": "Is the rocky, uneven ground surface visible beneath the arch and extending toward the foreground?",

      "thinking_process": "The visible sky and distant greenery through the arch are key indicators of the external environment. They establish context and depth. The instructions do not specify replacing or obscuring this view, so it must remain visible. Losing this would eliminate the sense of openness and connection to the outside world.",
      "question": "Is the bright sky and distant tree-covered hillside still visible through the arch opening?",

      "thinking_process": "The spatial depth created by the cave’s interior leading toward the arch is essential to the image’s composition. The perspective lines formed by the rock walls and the path to the opening must remain consistent. This depth is not mentioned as something to be changed, so it must be preserved to maintain the scene’s realism and navigability.",
      "question": "Is the cave interior structured with converging rock walls and a clear path leading toward the arch opening?",

      "thinking_process": "The texture and color variation of the rock surfaces (beige to light brown with weathering patterns) are characteristic of the original geological formation. While the arch itself may gain new textures, the surrounding rock walls should retain their natural appearance unless specified otherwise. Preserving these textures maintains the authenticity of the non-transformed parts of the scene.",
      "question": "Are the surrounding rock walls still composed of layered sedimentary rock with natural weathering patterns and beige-to-brown coloration?",
