Description of reference image: The subject is a portrait of an elderly man with long, wavy gray hair and a full, flowing beard that extends down to his chest. He wears a dark, soft-textured black cap that sits low on his forehead, partially covering his brow. His facial features are finely rendered, with high cheekbones, a straight nose, and deep-set eyes that gaze directly forward with a calm, introspective expression. The skin tone is pale with subtle modeling of light and shadow, indicating a naturalistic rendering typical of Renaissance portraiture. He is dressed in dark, textured clothing, likely wool or linen, with a visible collar and layered fabric suggesting a heavy garment. The background is a plain, muted olive-brown tone, devoid of any decorative elements, providing a neutral backdrop that emphasizes the figure’s presence. The overall composition is centered, with the subject occupying most of the frame, and the lighting is soft, coming from the left side, casting gentle shadows on the right side of his face and beard.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions word by word. The instruction specifies transforming the portrait into a stylized oil painting on a wooden panel — this indicates a change in medium and texture but does not specify altering the identity of the subject. It explicitly states changes to the mustache and beard (exaggerated, elongated, flowing like water), clothing (dark velvet cloak with golden embroidery), headwear (wide-brimmed hat with peacock feathers), accessories (gem-encrusted brooch), and background (abstract swirling starry night). These are all clear modifications to form, material, and setting. However, no mention is made of changing the core facial structure, eye position, or overall identity of the subject. Therefore, the subject's face — particularly the eyes, nose, mouth, and general facial proportions — should remain recognizable as the original figure. The background is explicitly replaced, so it is not required to be preserved. The clothing style, hat type, and accessories are all specified to be changed, thus allowed for modification.

Allowed Changes List:
- Mustache and beard shape, length, and flow (to be exaggerated and fluid)
- Clothing material and design (to be dark velvet with golden embroidery)
- Hat type (from beret-style to wide-brimmed with peacock feathers)
- Accessories (addition of gem-encrusted brooch)
- Background (to be abstract swirling starry night)
- Medium and surface (to be oil on wooden panel)
- Overall artistic style (stylized oil painting)

Step 2 - Determine the elements that should remain unchanged

Thinking process:
Core recognition elements: The identity of the subject in this image is widely recognized as Leonardo da Vinci based on historical and artistic context. Key visual identifiers include the distinctive facial structure — especially the shape of the eyes, the bridge and tip of the nose, the placement of the eyebrows, and the overall symmetry of the face. These features are essential for recognizing the individual as Leonardo da Vinci. Altering them would result in loss of identity. Additionally, the direction of gaze (forward) and the positioning of facial features relative to each other (e.g., eye alignment, jawline) are critical for maintaining likeness.

Functional/logical association elements: There are no functional interactions (e.g., holding tools, interacting with objects) in this image, so no logical dependencies exist between subject and object. However, the spatial relationship of the head to the shoulders and torso must remain consistent — the head should still be positioned atop the body in a natural pose, even if clothing changes.

Non modified element deduction: After excluding all elements listed as allowed to change (beard, clothing, hat, background), the remaining unmentioned facial features — including eye shape, eyebrow arch, nose contour, lips, and ear visibility — must be retained. These are not mentioned in the editing instructions as being altered, and they are key to preserving the identity of the subject. Furthermore, the texture and coloration of the skin, though possibly enhanced stylistically, must retain the original tonal values and shading patterns to maintain realism and continuity with the original.

Preservation Targets List:
- The shape and position of the eyes
- The contour and structure of the nose
- The shape and position of the mouth and lips
- The overall facial symmetry and proportion
- The direction of gaze (forward-facing)
- The visible portion of the ear on the left side
- The skin tone and shading pattern around the face
- The positioning of the head relative to the shoulders

Q1:  
Thinking process: The eyes are the most prominent feature in this portrait and serve as a primary identifier of Leonardo da Vinci. Their almond shape, upward tilt at the outer corners, and direct forward gaze are iconic and historically documented. Any alteration to their shape, position, or orientation would fundamentally change the subject's identity. This is a core recognition element, making it essential to preserve.
Question: Are the eyes positioned symmetrically within the face, with a slight upward slant at the outer edges and gazing directly forward?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The nose is a defining anatomical feature in this portrait, characterized by a straight bridge and a refined tip. Its shape contributes significantly to the facial identity and has been consistently represented in known depictions of Leonardo. Changing its form would disrupt recognition.
Question: Does the nose have a straight bridge and a slightly rounded tip, aligned centrally between the eyes?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The mouth and lips are distinct in their thinness and closed, serene expression. The slight upward curve at the corners suggests contemplation, a hallmark of Leonardo’s portrayal. This detail is crucial for emotional authenticity and identity retention.
Question: Are the lips thin, closed, and slightly upturned at the corners, forming a neutral yet thoughtful expression?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The overall facial symmetry and proportion are central to the portrait’s balance and recognizability. Any distortion in width, height, or spacing between features would make the face unrecognizable as Leonardo’s. This includes the relative distance between the eyes, nose, and mouth.
Question: Is the face proportionally balanced, with equal spacing between the eyes and symmetrical distribution of facial features?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The ear on the left side is partially visible beneath the hair and is a minor but identifiable anatomical detail. While not as prominent as the eyes or nose, its presence helps confirm the three-dimensionality and realism of the portrait. Removing or distorting it could affect coherence.
Question: Is the left ear partially visible, emerging from under the hair near the temple?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The skin tone and shading around the face — particularly the soft transition from light to shadow on the cheeks and chin — are characteristic of the original painting technique. These details contribute to the lifelike quality and must be preserved even if stylized.
Question: Are there soft shadows along the right side of the face and under the jawline, created by directional lighting from the left?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The head is positioned naturally atop the shoulders, maintaining a realistic posture. Even with changes to clothing and background, the structural alignment of the head relative to the torso must remain intact to preserve the figure’s integrity.
Question: Is the head centered above the shoulders, with no unnatural tilt or rotation?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2
