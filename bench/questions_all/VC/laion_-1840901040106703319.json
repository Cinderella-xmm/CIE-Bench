      "thinking_process": "The three triangular windows at the peak of the A-frame roof are a defining architectural feature of this cabin. Their presence and arrangement form a distinctive visual signature that identifies the structure. Removing or altering their shape would fundamentally change the identity of the building. Even if transformed into crystal facets, their triangular geometry and central positioning must be preserved to maintain recognition. This is a core identity element, hence weighted 3 points.",
      "question": "Are the three triangular windows positioned at the apex of the A-frame roof clearly present and maintaining their triangular shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The two-level structure — with a deck on the upper level and a garage on the lower level — is critical to the functional layout of the cabin. Changing the deck to a different level or removing the garage would violate the architectural logic of the original. Even in crystal form, the upper deck must exist and be supported by columns, and the lower level must house the garage. This spatial hierarchy is essential for coherence, making it a high-priority retention target.",
      "question": "Is the cabin structured with a raised deck on the upper level and a garage on the lower level, maintaining the same vertical separation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The garage door is located on the right side of the lower level and is a key functional component. Its position is consistent with the original image and must be preserved to maintain spatial logic. Moving it to another side or replacing it with a non-functional opening would disrupt the intended layout. Although the material may change, its location and purpose must remain unchanged.",
      "question": "Is the garage door located on the right side of the lower level, adjacent to the main entrance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The central vertical axis of the cabin is symmetric, with the main entrance and roof peak aligned. This symmetry is a core design feature. Any asymmetry introduced during transformation would distort the original identity. Preserving this alignment ensures the structure remains recognizable as the same cabin, even in crystal form.",
      "question": "Is the cabin symmetric about its central vertical axis, with the roof peak, main entrance, and supporting columns aligned centrally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The deck is supported by vertical columns that extend from the ground to the upper level. These columns are essential for structural integrity and are visually distinct in the original image. Even if transformed into crystal facets, their number, spacing, and vertical orientation must be preserved to maintain the architectural framework. Losing them would collapse the support system and make the transformation illogical.",
      "question": "Are the vertical support columns beneath the deck present and positioned at regular intervals along the front facade?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The lower-level window on the left side of the cabin is a minor but identifiable detail. It contributes to the balance of the façade and helps distinguish this cabin from others. While not as critical as the garage or deck, its presence adds visual coherence. Its removal or relocation would create an imbalance and reduce fidelity to the original.",
      "question": "Is the small rectangular window located on the lower level, to the left of the main entrance, still present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The stone retaining wall on the right side of the cabin, composed of large boulders, is a specific environmental detail that grounds the structure in its setting. While the instruction allows changes to the ground, preserving this feature maintains contextual authenticity. It is a secondary detail but contributes to the overall realism and scene consistency.",
      "question": "Is the stone retaining wall made of large, irregular boulders visible on the right side of the cabin's base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
