**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a humanoid figure wearing a highly detailed, realistic tiger mask with prominent orange and black stripes, white fur around the face, and sharp fangs visible through an open mouth. The mask features upright ears with orange inner linings, dark eyes, and long, distinct whiskers extending from the snout. The figure is dressed in a traditional Japanese kimono with a cream-colored base adorned with pink cherry blossom patterns and black branches. The kimono has a layered structure with a black obi (sash) accented by red horizontal bands, and a red inner collar. The background consists of hanging pink cherry blossoms suspended on strings, some with small tassels, creating a soft, ethereal atmosphere. The setting appears to be indoors, possibly within a wooden temple or shrine, with blurred vertical beams and ambient lighting that enhances the serene yet mystical mood.

**Thinking process:**  
First, analyze the editing instructions word by word:  
- "Convert into a paper-cut style" → This indicates a complete transformation of visual texture and rendering technique; thus, **texture, shading, and depth cues** are allowed to change.  
- "Exaggerated stripes and enlarged whiskers for a playful effect" → **Stripe thickness and whisker length** can be altered.  
- "Integrate floral kimono as layered paper panels" → The **kimono’s design and layering** can be restructured into paper layers.  
- "Gold foil cherry blossoms" → **Color and material of blossoms** can change (gold foil instead of natural pink).  
- "Add detachable panels for each postcard with interactive folding elements" → **Structural functionality** (folding, detachability) is added, implying modifications to physical form.  

However, the instruction does not mention changing:  
- The **presence of the tiger mask**, though its style changes.  
- The **cherry blossom motif** on the kimono and background—only its material (gold foil) and presentation (layered panels) are modified.  
- The **overall composition** (subject centered, facing forward, seated posture) is implied to remain consistent for postcard layout.  
- The **identity of the subject** (masked tiger in kimono) must persist, even if stylized.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
- Texture of the entire image (from photorealistic to paper-cut)  
- Stripe pattern thickness and exaggeration on the tiger mask  
- Whisker length and prominence  
- Kimono fabric texture and structure (transformed into layered paper panels)  
- Cherry blossom color and material (changed to gold foil)  
- Addition of detachable, foldable panel elements  
- Background rendering (softness, depth, lighting) adjusted to match paper-cut aesthetic

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
Core recognition elements:  
- The **tiger mask** is central to identity. Even in paper-cut style, it must remain recognizable as a tiger. Key features such as **orange and black striped pattern**, **white facial fur**, **black eye markings**, **open mouth with fangs**, and **ear shape** are essential for identification. These cannot be replaced with other animal features.  
- The **kimono with cherry blossom pattern** is a key cultural identifier. While the material may change, the **blossom motifs themselves must remain present**—their presence ensures continuity with the original theme.  
- The **subject’s posture and orientation** (front-facing, seated, upper body visible) must be preserved to maintain compositional integrity for postcards.  

Functional/logical association elements:  
- The **mask-kimono pairing** represents a symbolic fusion of animal spirit and human culture. Changing this relationship would undermine the thematic logic.  
- The **background cherry blossoms** are not just decoration—they reinforce the seasonal and cultural context. Their **presence and position relative to the subject** should be maintained, even if stylized.  

Non-modified element deduction:  
After excluding allowed changes (texture, stripe exaggeration, whisker size, material), the following remain:  
- The **exact shape and arrangement of cherry blossoms** on the kimono (not just their presence but their pattern distribution).  
- The **color scheme** of the kimono (cream base with pink blossoms, red obi, black trim)—though gold foil may be added, the underlying floral design must still be visible.  
- The **structure of the obi**, including its red bands and placement across the waist.  
- The **tiger’s facial structure**: eye shape, nose position, mouth openness, and fang visibility.  

These elements are not mentioned as changeable and are necessary for visual coherence and identity retention.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
- The tiger mask's orange and black striped pattern  
- The presence and positioning of the cherry blossom motifs on the kimono  
- The open mouth revealing fangs in the tiger mask  
- The front-facing, seated posture of the subject  
- The cream-colored kimono with pink cherry blossoms and black branch outlines  
- The red obi with horizontal bands wrapped around the waist  
- The hanging cherry blossoms in the background  
- The overall composition placing the subject centrally

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

Q1:  
Thinking process: The orange and black striped pattern on the tiger mask is the core identity feature distinguishing it as a tiger. Without these stripes in the correct color and distribution, the mask would lose its essential identity. Even in paper-cut style, the pattern must remain identifiable. This is a 3-point element because it defines the subject’s species and role in the artwork.  
Question: Is the tiger mask clearly defined with orange and black stripes arranged in a typical tiger pattern?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The cherry blossom pattern on the kimono is a key cultural and visual motif. Its presence and specific arrangement (pink flowers on black branches) are essential for maintaining the scene’s identity. Even if rendered in paper-cut style, the floral pattern must remain visually recognizable. This is a 3-point element due to its symbolic importance and visual dominance.  
Question: Are pink cherry blossoms with black branch outlines visible on the kimono?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The open mouth showing fangs is a defining characteristic of the tiger mask, contributing to its fierce expression and realism. This feature must be preserved to retain the mask’s expressive intent, even if stylized. Losing it would alter the emotional tone and identity of the subject.  
Question: Does the tiger mask show an open mouth with visible fangs?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q4:

Q5:  
Thinking process: The subject’s front-facing, seated posture is crucial for the postcard format and composition. It ensures the viewer sees the full frontal view of the mask and kimono, which is essential for artistic display. Altering the angle would disrupt the intended presentation.  
Question: Is the subject positioned directly facing the viewer in a seated posture?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The hanging cherry blossoms in the background provide environmental context and thematic consistency. Their presence reinforces the springtime and Japanese aesthetic. Even if transformed into paper-cut style, they must remain suspended in the air around the subject.  
Question: Are pink cherry blossoms hanging from above in the background?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The cream base color of the kimono is a foundational element that contrasts with the pink blossoms and red obi. Changing it would alter the visual harmony and cultural representation. Though material may change, the base color must remain.  
Question: Is the kimono primarily cream-colored with pink floral patterns?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q8:  
Thinking process: The black trim along the kimono’s edges and obi provides structural definition and contrast. It is a minor but important detail that contributes to the garment’s authenticity. Removing it would simplify the design too much.
