      "thinking_process": "The metallic mask with its distinct angular shape and filigree engraving is the primary identifier of the fairy’s identity. Its unique design, especially the upward-pointing crest and eye-covering section, is essential for recognizing her as a fantasy figure. If the mask’s shape is altered, such as becoming rounded or simplified, it would no longer be recognizable as the same character. Therefore, the presence and form of the mask are core identity features, warranting a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the angular, filigree-patterned metallic mask covering the upper face, including the prominent crest and eye-covering section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The wings’ vein structure and overall shape are critical to identifying the subject as a fairy with butterfly-like wings. Although the instructions allow for a metallic or shimmering texture, the underlying structure—specifically the branching veins and mottled brown-orange coloration—must remain to preserve the original visual identity. Altering the wing shape or vein pattern would fundamentally change the character’s appearance. This is a core identity feature, hence a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Are the butterfly wings retained with their original veined structure and mottled brown-orange coloration, even if rendered with a metallic or shimmering surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The thin wire or cord extending from the base of the wing is a specific detail that suggests mechanical or magical attachment. It is a non-redundant feature that contributes to the narrative logic of the wings. Removing or replacing it would disrupt the functional coherence of the design. Since it is not mentioned as changeable, it must be preserved. This is a functional detail, important for maintaining logical consistency, so it receives a weight of 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the thin wire or cord extending from the base of the left wing still present and connected to the wing structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The form-fitting dress with its halter neckline, lace-like embroidery, and high waistline defines the character’s silhouette and style. While texture may be enhanced, the outline and placement of decorative patterns must remain consistent to maintain visual continuity. This is a key accessory and design element, crucial for identification. Its alteration would affect recognition, making it a 2-point element.",
      "question": "Does the outfit retain the halter-neck silhouette with lace-like embroidery along the torso and arms, including the high waist and fitted form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The subject’s pose—side profile with head slightly turned toward the viewer—is integral to her presentation and emotional expression. This posture contributes to the elegance and mystery of the character. Changing it would alter the narrative framing. Though not the most defining feature, it is a key compositional element that affects visual coherence. Thus, it is assigned 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the fairy depicted in a side profile pose, with her head slightly turned toward the viewer and her gaze directed forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The dangling beaded earrings are a minor but distinctive detail that complements the mask and adds to the character’s ornamental style. They are visually unique and contribute to the overall aesthetic. While not central to identity, their absence would reduce visual fidelity and coherence. Hence, they are a detail-level element, assigned 1 point.",
      "question": "Are the dangling beaded earrings still visible on the subject’s ears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The closed eyes and red lips are facial features that define the subject’s serene and mysterious expression. These are not merely decorative but convey emotion and identity. Altering them (e.g., opening the eyes or changing lip color) would significantly affect the character’s mood and recognition. As key facial identifiers, they are essential and thus receive a weight of 2 points.",
      "question": "Are the subject’s eyes closed and her lips painted red, matching the original appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
