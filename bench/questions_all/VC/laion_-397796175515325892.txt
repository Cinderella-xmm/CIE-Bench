**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a historic church with a prominent central spire topped by a cross, constructed in light beige stone with red-tiled roofing. The architectural style is Neo-Romanesque or Neo-Gothic, featuring arched windows, decorative stonework, and a symmetrical façade with a central entrance framed by columns and a pointed arch. The spire rises sharply from the roofline, tapering to a red conical top with a golden cross at its apex. The building has multiple levels of ornamentation including small arched openings, blind arcades, and decorative cornices. In front of the church are parked cars, leafless tree branches (some with sparse yellow leaves), overhead tram lines, and adjacent urban buildings. The sky is overcast, creating a soft, diffused lighting condition. The scene includes a mix of natural elements (trees) and urban infrastructure (traffic lights, street lamps, power lines).

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction specifies:  
- "Convert the structure into a semi-cartoon style" → allows transformation of artistic style, line work, and rendering technique.  
- "Enhance symmetry" → permits adjustment of proportions and alignment for idealized balance.  
- "Add metallic gold accents to highlight spires" → explicitly modifies color and material on spire elements.  
- "Adjust proportion for grandeur" → allows scaling and exaggeration of size relationships.  
- "Integrate into celestial-themed backgrounds" → replaces original background entirely.  
- "Present prints in matte black frames, curated in a trifold album" → changes presentation context but not content of the image itself.

These instructions indicate that:
- The **artistic style** can be changed (semi-cartoon).
- The **proportions** of the church can be altered.
- The **background** is fully replaceable (celestial theme).
- The **color scheme** of certain elements (spires) can be modified (gold accents).
- The **symmetry** may be enhanced beyond original.
- However, the **identity of the church**—its structural form, key architectural features, and symbolic elements—must remain recognizable despite stylization.

Therefore, allowed changes include:
- Artistic rendering (semi-cartoon)
- Background replacement (celestial theme)
- Color modification (gold on spires)
- Proportion adjustment
- Symmetry enhancement

**Allowed Changes List:**  
(Specific element 1 that allows for changes): Artistic style (e.g., cartoon-like outlines, simplified textures)  
(Specific element 2 that allows for changes): Background environment (replaced with celestial theme)  
(Specific element 3 that allows for changes): Proportional scale of the church (to enhance grandeur)  
(Specific element 4 that allows for changes): Symmetry of architectural layout (can be exaggerated)  
(Specific element 5 that allows for changes): Color of spire elements (addition of metallic gold)  
(Specific element 6 that allows for changes): Rendering technique (e.g., flat colors, bold lines)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
To determine what must remain unchanged, we apply exclusion based on the above allowed changes:

1. **Core recognition elements**:  
   - The church’s **distinctive spire with a cross at the top** is a defining feature. Even if stylized, the presence of a tall, pointed spire capped with a cross is essential for identification as a Christian church and likely a landmark. This is a core identity marker.  
   - The **central arched doorway** with flanking columns and ornamental pediment is an architectural hallmark. Its position and shape are critical for recognizing the building’s entrance and stylistic intent.  
   - The **overall silhouette** of the church—especially the tall spire rising above a lower roofline with gabled sections—is iconic. Even with symmetry enhancement, this form must remain recognizable.  
   - The **red-tiled roof** and **light-colored stone walls** are dominant visual characteristics. While color can be adjusted (e.g., gold added), the base materials and their spatial distribution should still reflect the original.  

2. **Functional/logical association elements**:  
   - The **relationship between the spire and the main body** must remain logical: the spire must still rise from the center of the roof, maintaining its role as a vertical focal point.  
   - The **position of the entrance** relative to the rest of the façade must stay consistent—centered under the main gable—to preserve architectural logic.  

3. **Non-modified element deduction**:  
   After excluding allowed changes, the following must be retained due to visual coherence and identity preservation:
   - The **presence of arched windows**, especially those in the upper tiers and around the central rose window.  
   - The **ornamental detailing** such as blind arcades and decorative bands between levels.  
   - The **basic layout** of the façade: two lateral towers (or projections), central nave, and spire.  
   - The **cross atop the spire** must remain present—even if stylized—as it is a religious symbol and key identifier.  

These elements are not mentioned in the allowed change list and are essential for preserving the identity of the church as a specific historical and architectural object.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
(Element 1 that should be maintained): Presence of a tall, pointed spire with a cross at the apex  
(Element 2 that should be maintained): Central arched entrance beneath a triangular pediment  
(Element 3 that should be maintained): Red-tiled roof covering the main structure and side gables  
(Element 4 that should be maintained): Arched windows arranged symmetrically across the façade  
(Element 5 that should be maintained): Light-colored stone masonry forming the primary wall material  
(Element 6 that should be maintained): Overall three-part façade composition (side towers, central section, spire)  
(Element 7 that should be maintained): Presence of a cross at the very top of the spire  
(Element 8 that should be maintained): Position of the main entrance directly below the central gable

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

Q1:  
Thinking process: The tall, pointed spire with a cross at the apex is the most distinctive feature of the church and serves as its primary identifier. If removed or replaced with another form (e.g., dome or flat roof), the building would no longer be recognizable as this specific church. Its presence and vertical dominance are essential for identity retention. Therefore, this is a core recognition element with a weight of 3 points.  
Question: Is there a tall, pointed spire rising from the center of the church roof, topped with a cross?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The central arched entrance with a triangular pediment is a key architectural feature that defines the main access point and contributes to the church’s formal symmetry. Its absence or relocation would distort the building's identity and functional layout. This is a critical structural element that must remain in place, making it a high-weight preservation target.  
Question: Is there a centrally located arched doorway beneath a triangular pediment on the main façade?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The red-tiled roof is a defining visual contrast against the light stone walls and contributes significantly to the church’s appearance. While the instruction allows adding gold accents, it does not permit removing or replacing the red tiles. The color and placement of the tiles are integral to the original design and must be preserved even if stylized.  
Question: Are the roof surfaces covered with red tiles, particularly on the main gable and side slopes?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The arched windows are characteristic of the church’s Neo-Romanesque style and appear in multiple rows across the façade. Their shape and arrangement contribute to the building’s rhythm and identity. Changing them to rectangular or removing them would alter the architectural character. They are important but not the sole identifier, so they are assigned a weight of 2.  
Question: Are there multiple arched windows visible on the upper levels of the church façade, arranged symmetrically?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The light-colored stone masonry is the primary material of the church’s exterior and provides the base texture and tone. Even with cartoon-style rendering, the material must remain visually identifiable as stone, not wood or metal. This is a key detail for authenticity and consistency.  
Question: Is the main body of the church constructed from light-colored stone blocks or masonry?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The overall three-part façade—side towers or projections, central nave, and central spire—is a structural signature of the building. Altering this layout (e.g., merging sides or flattening the center) would fundamentally change the architecture. This compositional structure is essential for recognition.  
Question: Does the church façade consist of a central section flanked by two symmetrical side sections, with a spire rising from the center?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The cross at the top of the spire is a religious symbol and a key identifying feature. It distinguishes this church from others and confirms its function. Removing or replacing it would violate both visual and symbolic identity. Even if stylized, it must remain present.  
Question: Is there a cross positioned at the very tip of the spire?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q8:  
Thinking process: The presence of a central entrance directly beneath the main gable ensures architectural coherence. Moving it off-center or placing it elsewhere would break the symmetry and logical flow of the design. This is a functional and visual anchor point.  
Question: Is the main entrance located directly under the central gable and aligned with the peak of the roof?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2
