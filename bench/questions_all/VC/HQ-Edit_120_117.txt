**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a tall, cylindrical lighthouse situated on a rocky coastal outcrop surrounded by turbulent ocean waves. The lighthouse has a weathered stone base with a rectangular foundation featuring arched windows and a central wooden door. Above this base, the tower rises in a tapering cylindrical form made of aged, grayish stone with visible rust stains and discoloration. Near the top, there are two small rectangular windows and a circular gallery railing. The lantern room at the summit is red with glass panes and a red dome roof topped by a small metallic cross or finial. The surrounding environment includes crashing turquoise waves, white foam, and jagged rocks covered in patches of green moss and grass. A narrow stone path leads from the foreground toward the lighthouse. In the background, distant mountains are visible under a partly cloudy sky with voluminous white clouds against a bright blue expanse. Several broken wooden utility poles lean precariously near the lighthouse, partially submerged by water. The foreground features wildflowers (pink and red), dry grass, and low shrubs growing along the coastline.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction states: *"Transform the lighthouse scene into a nautical globe display."* This indicates a complete transformation of the **scene’s physical form**, not just a stylistic change. The original lighthouse and its environment will be reimagined as **contained within a globe**. Therefore, the **overall spatial structure** and **presentation format** are allowed to change.

Specifically:
- "Inside the globe: A miniature 3D lighthouse model stands on rocky terrain surrounded by stylized crashing waves made from translucent blue resin" → implies that the **lighthouse itself is preserved in miniature form**, but now **scaled down and embedded in a new medium**.
- "Globe base: A wooden base with engraved compass rose pattern" → introduces a **new structural element** not present originally; thus, the base is replaceable.
- "Background elements: Add painted clouds and a distant mountain panorama for depth" → indicates that **background elements may be altered or replaced**, though **some scenic components (like mountains and clouds)** may be retained in **stylized form**.
- "Color palette: Earthy tones for rocks and vibrant blues for water" → allows **color adjustments**, especially in materials and lighting, but **does not mandate changing core visual identities**.

Key changes allowed:
- **Form of presentation**: From real-world coastal scene to enclosed globe.
- **Materials**: Original natural textures replaced by resin, wood, paint.
- **Scale**: Lighthouse becomes miniature.
- **Environment**: Realistic ocean and sky replaced with stylized representations inside a globe.
- **Background**: Replaced with painted versions, though inspired by original.

However, the instruction **does not specify altering the fundamental identity** of the lighthouse — it says “a miniature 3D lighthouse model,” implying **retention of its core shape and structure**.

Thus, **the lighthouse’s iconic form and key architectural features must be preserved**, even if scaled or stylized.

---

**Allowed Changes List:**
- The overall scene layout (from open sea to enclosed globe)
- Background sky and clouds (replaced with painted version)
- Water representation (realistic waves → translucent blue resin)
- Rocks (natural texture → earthy tone material)
- Foreground vegetation (wildflowers and grass → possibly omitted or simplified)
- Utility poles (likely removed or reinterpreted)
- Lighting and color scheme (adjusted to match new medium)
- Scale of the lighthouse (miniature version)
- Presence of a globe container and wooden base with compass rose
- Perspective and framing (from wide-angle coastal view to close-up of globe)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
We now identify what **must remain unchanged** based on exclusion from the allowed changes list and logical consistency:

1. **Core recognition elements**:
   - The lighthouse is the central subject. Its **distinctive architectural form** — cylindrical tower, red lantern room, gallery railing, stone base with arched windows and door — defines its identity. Even in miniature, these features must be recognizable.
   - The **red lantern room** is an iconic feature; its color and position are critical for identification.
   - The **cylindrical shape** of the tower is essential — a square or conical shape would make it unrecognizable as this specific lighthouse.
   - The **position of windows and door** relative to the structure must be preserved to maintain architectural authenticity.

2. **Functional/logical association elements**:
   - The **lighthouse stands on rocky terrain** — this is implied by the instruction ("on rocky terrain"), so the **foundation context** must be retained.
   - The **relationship between the lighthouse and the sea** must be preserved in some form — the lighthouse must still appear to be **surrounded by waves**, even if they are stylized resin waves.
   - The **door and windows** are functional parts of the building; their presence and placement are necessary for structural coherence.

3. **Non-modified element deduction**:
   - Although the **utility poles** are mentioned in the original image, they are **not referenced in the instructions** and are likely considered **accidental debris** rather than core features. They can be removed.
   - The **foreground path** and **wildflowers** are part of the original composition but are **not required in the globe description** — they may be omitted.
   - The **sky and clouds** are replaced with painted versions, so their **original form** need not be preserved, only their **presence and function** (depth and atmosphere).

Therefore, **only the lighthouse's core architectural elements** and **its spatial relationship to the terrain and sea** must be retained.

**Preservation Targets List:**
- The cylindrical tower with tapered design and weathered stone texture
- The red lantern room with glass panes and domed roof
- The gallery railing around the lantern room
- The rectangular stone base with arched windows and central wooden door
- The positioning of the lighthouse on rocky terrain
- The presence of waves surrounding the base of the lighthouse
- The relative placement of windows and door on the structure

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The red lantern room is a defining feature of the lighthouse, providing strong visual contrast and symbolic identity. It is located at the top of the tower and is distinct in both color and structure. If this element is lost or changed (e.g., turned yellow or removed), the lighthouse would no longer be identifiable as the original subject. Thus, its presence and color are critical for recognition.
    Question: Is the red lantern room with glass panes and domed roof present at the top of the lighthouse?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The cylindrical tower with its tapering form is the primary structural identifier of the lighthouse. Changing its shape to conical or rectangular would fundamentally alter its identity. The texture of the stone, including rust stains and weathering, contributes to its realism and uniqueness. Preserving this form ensures the object remains recognizable as the same lighthouse.
    Question: Does the lighthouse have a cylindrical tower with a tapering shape and weathered stone surface?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The gallery railing encircling the lantern room is a distinctive architectural detail that separates the lighthouse from similar structures. Its presence confirms the correct design and adds to the functional appearance of the tower. Removing it would make the structure look incomplete or incorrect.
    Question: Is there a metal railing encircling the lantern room near the top of the lighthouse?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The rectangular stone base with arched windows and a central wooden door is a key component of the lighthouse’s lower structure. This section provides functional and aesthetic grounding. Altering its shape or removing the door/windows would compromise the architectural integrity of the lighthouse.
    Question: Does the lighthouse have a rectangular stone base with arched windows and a central wooden door?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The lighthouse is positioned on rocky terrain, which is essential for its coastal identity. Even in the miniature globe, the lighthouse must rest on rock-like terrain to reflect its original setting. Removing this would break the environmental logic and reduce recognizability.
    Question: Is the lighthouse standing on rocky terrain within the scene?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The waves surrounding the base of the lighthouse are crucial for conveying its maritime location. While the material may change (to resin), the presence of waves crashing around the rocks must be maintained to preserve the scene’s context. Without them, the lighthouse appears isolated and loses its coastal character.
    Question: Are there waves depicted around the base of the lighthouse, indicating its seaside location?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The window placement — particularly the vertical alignment of small rectangular windows and the larger arched window below — is a specific architectural detail. These are not arbitrary; their positions contribute to the lighthouse’s unique silhouette. Changing their location would distort the structure.
    Question: Are the windows on the tower arranged vertically with one small window above another, and an arched window on the base?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}
{
    Q8: 
    Thinking process: The presence of a wooden door centered on the front of the base is a minor but identifiable feature. While not as critical as the lantern room, it contributes to the overall architectural accuracy. Its absence might suggest a different structure, slightly affecting coherence.
    Question: Is there a wooden door centered on the front face of the lighthouse base?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
