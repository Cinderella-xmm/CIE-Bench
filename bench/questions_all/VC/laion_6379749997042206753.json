      "thinking_process": "The brand name \"Karls\" is a key identifier of the product and manufacturer. Its presence on the label is essential for brand recognition. If removed or altered, the product becomes unidentifiable as Karls' offering. This is a core identity feature, making it a 3-point question.",
      "question": "Is the brand name \"Karls\" clearly visible on the label of the jar?",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The product name \"Pumpkin Spice Popcorn\" defines the flavor and product type. It is a core textual element that distinguishes this item from others. Losing it would make the product ambiguous. It is a high-priority identification element, thus weighted at 3.",
      "question": "Is the text \"Pumpkin Spice Popcorn\" present on the label of the jar?",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The glass jar with metal lid is the primary container and a signature packaging format. Even in a whimsical version, retaining its basic form ensures product recognition. Changing it to a non-jar shape would break the visual link to the original. This is a key structural element, hence 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the popcorn contained in a clear glass jar with a silver metal lid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The ceramic bowl with a blue rim is a distinctive object in the scene. It appears in two locations and is part of the final destination of the popcorn. Its unique shape and rim color are important for scene continuity. Removing or altering it would disrupt the visual narrative and scene coherence. Thus, it is a 2-point element.",
      "question": "Is there a white ceramic bowl with a blue rim containing popped popcorn?",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The presence of both unpopped kernels and popped popcorn establishes the transformation narrative. The unpopped kernels in the separate jar are essential for showing the starting point of the journey. Their absence would break the logical flow of the story. This is a key functional element, so it is weighted at 2.",
      "question": "Are unpopped corn kernels visible in a separate clear jar?",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The orange-brown color scheme is central to the autumn theme and brand identity. While stylized, the dominant colors must remain consistent to preserve the seasonal and brand feel. Deviating significantly would alter the product's visual identity. This is a key aesthetic element, thus 2 points.",
      "question": "Are the dominant colors of the labels and popcorn orange and brown?",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The wooden surface provides context and grounding for the scene. While it may be stylized, its presence supports the rustic, homemade feel. Removing it would change the environmental tone. It is a minor but important scene element, hence 1 point.",
      "question": "Is the scene set on a wooden surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "thinking_process": "Scattered popcorn kernels on the surface add realism and suggest activity. They reinforce the idea of popcorn being freshly popped and active. While not central, their absence would reduce visual richness and coherence. This is a detail-level element, so 1 point.",
      "question": "Are unpopped or popped popcorn kernels scattered on the surface around the jars?",
