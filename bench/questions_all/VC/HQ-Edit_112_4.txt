Description of reference image: The subject is a Blue Jay perched sideways on a wooden fence rail, facing right. Its head is slightly turned toward the viewer, showcasing its sharp black beak and dark eye with a subtle white ring around it. The bird’s crest is prominent and vividly blue, standing upright. Its upper body features a gradient of bright cobalt blue transitioning into lighter lavender-blue on the neck and chest. The wings are folded close to the body, displaying intricate patterns of deep blue feathers interlaced with bold white patches forming cloud-like shapes along the wing edges. The tail is long and fan-shaped, composed of striking vertical bars of alternating deep blue and black, ending in broad white tips at the feather ends. The underbelly is pale grayish-white, contrasting with the vibrant plumage above. The legs are thin and black, gripping the wooden rail firmly. The background consists of dense, lush green ivy leaves covering a wall, creating a natural, textured backdrop. Sunlight filters from the top-right corner, casting a warm golden glow and lens flare effect, enhancing depth and highlighting the bird's feathers.

Thinking process: First, analyze the instructions that clearly state what can be changed. The instruction says to "transform the Blue Jay into a whimsical miniature sculpture inside a glass dome terrarium," which implies the **form** of the bird (its physical state) may change — from a live bird to a sculpted representation. It also specifies new scene elements like a glass dome, wooden perch within the terrarium, ivy winding upward, tiny crafted leaves, and a stylized tree stump. These indicate that the **environmental context** is fully replaceable. However, the instruction explicitly retains certain visual characteristics: “use the bird's vibrant blue and white palette” — this means the **color scheme** must remain consistent even if the form changes. Additionally, the instruction refers to placing it "on a wooden perch" — so while the perch may be reimagined as part of a terrarium setup, the presence of a wooden perch element must still exist. The instruction does not mention changing the bird’s species or identity; instead, it describes transforming it into a sculpture based on its appearance. Therefore, the **core identity** of the bird — including its distinctive coloration and pattern — must be preserved, even if rendered in a different medium.

Allowed Changes List:
- The physical form of the Blue Jay (from living bird to miniature sculpture)
- The surrounding environment (from outdoor ivy-covered wall to enclosed glass dome terrarium)
- Background lighting and atmosphere (sunlight flare may be altered or removed)
- The scale of the bird (reduced to miniature size)
- Addition of new elements such as glass dome, stylized tree stump, crafted leaves
- Positioning of the bird relative to the perch (may now be elevated within a dome)

Step 2 - Determine the elements that should remain unchanged

Thinking process:
Core recognition elements: The Blue Jay is identifiable by its unique combination of colors and patterns. Specifically, the **vibrant blue crest**, **white facial markings**, **black facial stripe**, **blue-and-white wing patterns**, and **barred blue-and-black tail with white tips** are iconic features that distinguish it from other birds. Even when transformed into a sculpture, these visual identifiers must be retained for the subject to remain recognizable as a Blue Jay. The instruction mandates using the “vibrant blue and white palette,” confirming that color remains critical.

Functional/logical association elements: The bird must still be perched on a wooden surface, as stated in the instruction ("place it atop a wooden perch"). Although the setting changes, the **perching action** and **wooden support** are logically tied to the bird’s posture and position. This functional relationship — bird resting on wood — must be preserved, even if the wood is now part of a terrarium design.

Non modified element deduction: After excluding allowed changes (e.g., form, environment), the remaining unmentioned but visually present details in the original image that contribute to identity and coherence must be preserved. These include specific feather patterns (such as the white cloud-like patches on wings), the shape of the tail, the positioning of the crest, and the contrast between blue and white in the plumage. While the overall scene changes, the **visual essence** of the bird — its defining marks — must remain intact.

Preservation Targets List:
- The vibrant blue crest with upright posture
- The white facial markings and black facial stripe
- The blue-and-white wing patterns with distinct cloud-like white patches
- The barred blue-and-black tail with white-tipped feathers
- The bird's perching posture on a wooden surface
- The use of the blue and white color palette as primary visual elements

    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The upright blue crest is a key anatomical and visual identifier of the Blue Jay. Its presence and shape are essential for species recognition. If lost or altered in form (e.g., flattened or absent), the bird would no longer be identifiable as a Blue Jay. This feature is central to both real-world identification and artistic representation, making it a core identity element.
    Question: Is the bird’s crest upright and vividly blue, matching the original image?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The white facial markings and black facial stripe are signature traits of the Blue Jay, distinguishing it from similar corvids. Their precise placement and contrast are crucial for accurate identification. Altering or omitting them would fundamentally change the bird’s identity, even in a sculptural form.
    Question: Are there distinct white markings around the eye and a black stripe running through the face, as seen in the original?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The wing pattern — specifically the cloud-like white patches on a blue background — is a unique and highly recognizable trait of the Blue Jay. This pattern is not only diagnostic but also visually dominant in the image. Losing it would make the bird unrecognizable, even if color is preserved.
    Question: Do the wings display clear white patches resembling clouds against a blue background?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The tail feathers have a distinctive barred pattern of alternating blue and black stripes ending in white tips. This pattern is a hallmark of the Blue Jay and contributes significantly to its silhouette and identity. Even in a miniature sculpture, this detail must be preserved to maintain authenticity.
    Question: Does the tail show vertical blue and black bars ending in white tips?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The instruction specifies placing the bird on a wooden perch. Though the environment changes, the functional relationship of the bird perched on wood must remain. The wooden surface supports the bird and maintains continuity with the original pose. Changing this would break the logical consistency of the subject’s position.
    Question: Is the bird positioned on a wooden surface, maintaining the perching posture from the original image?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The instruction explicitly requires using the bird’s "vibrant blue and white palette." This means the dominant colors — especially the contrast between blue and white — must be preserved. While shading or material may change (e.g., due to sculpture texture), the core color scheme is essential for visual fidelity and identity.
    Question: Are the primary colors of the bird predominantly vibrant blue and white, matching the original?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
