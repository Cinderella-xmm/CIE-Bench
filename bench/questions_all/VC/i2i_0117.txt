Description of reference image: The subject is a superhero character dressed in a sleek, black, textured suit designed to resemble the scales of a panther. The character has a full face mask with pointed ears and sharp geometric lines around the eyes, giving a fierce and determined expression. The suit includes metallic accents on the shoulders and chest, featuring a distinct design that resembles a panther's claws. The character stands with a confident and powerful stance, set against a blurred background that suggests a cityscape with illuminated lights.

### Step 1 - Allowed Changes List:

**Thinking process:**  
The instructions request adding a high-tech robot and changing the scene to a futuristic city rooftop at night. Therefore, the background and positioning of elements can be altered. However, instructions do not mention changing the hero's suit, mask, or body posture, implying these should remain consistent. 

**Allowed Changes List:**  
- The background can be replaced with a futuristic city rooftop scene at night.  
- A new high-tech robot element can be added.  
- The lighting and atmosphere can be adjusted accordingly, such as adding neon or LED effects.

### Step 2 - Preservation Targets List:

**Thinking process:**  
- Core recognition elements: The superhero’s suit design, mask appearance, and iconic features (like the panther-like claws on the suit) should remain unchanged to ensure viewers recognize the character. 
- Functional/logical association elements: The character’s confident stance and overall posture should stay intact to maintain the heroic feel and consistency with the new scene.  
- Remaining elements: The texture and color of the suit, as well as the metallic accents' shape and position, should match the original for visual coherence.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
- The character's full-face mask with its distinctive geometric design and pointed ears.  
- The panther-scale texture and color of the suit.  
- The metallic claw-like accents on the suit.  
- The character's confident posture and stance.  
- The sharp lines and contours of the suit’s design.
