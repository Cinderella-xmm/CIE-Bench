      "thinking_process": "The \"Wildtrak\" badge is a core identity feature of the Ford Ranger Wildtrak trim level. Its presence on the lower side fender is a defining visual marker that distinguishes it from other trims like XLT or XL. If this badge is omitted or misplaced in the LEGO version, the model would lose its specific model identity, making it unrecognizable as a Wildtrak. Therefore, its position and visibility are essential.",
      "question": "Is the \"Wildtrak\" badge visible on the lower side fender of the vehicle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The open tailgate and visible truck bed are functional and visual identifiers of the pickup truck's utility. In the original image, the tailgate is fully down, exposing the textured bed floor and blue sticker. This configuration is critical to representing the truck as a work-ready vehicle. If the LEGO model closes the tailgate or hides the bed, it would misrepresent the intended function and appearance.",
      "question": "Is the tailgate fully lowered, exposing the truck bed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The dual-cab configuration with four doors is a fundamental design element that defines the vehicle type. The presence of two rear doors behind the front seats is essential to identify it as a crew cab rather than a regular cab. Losing this feature would make the model appear as a different vehicle class.",
      "question": "Are there two rear doors visible on the passenger side of the truck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The vertical taillight design with a red upper section and clear lower lens is a signature lighting feature of the Ford Ranger. It contributes to the vehicle’s brand identity and must be preserved in the LEGO model to maintain visual authenticity. Altering its shape or orientation would result in a non-representative design.",
      "question": "Do the rear taillights have a vertical orientation with a red upper portion and clear lower section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The roof rack is a distinctive accessory that identifies the Wildtrak trim. It is mounted across the top of the cab and is visible in the original image. Its inclusion in the LEGO model is necessary to preserve the vehicle's trim-specific appearance. Omitting it would reduce the model's fidelity to the original.",
      "question": "Is a roof rack visible on top of the cab?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The black trim along the window edges and bed surround is a consistent design element that enhances the truck's aesthetic and separates body panels. While not a core identity feature, it contributes to visual coherence and brand styling. Retaining it ensures the LEGO model matches the original’s refined look.",
      "question": "Is there black trim running along the edge of the windows and the bed surround?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The rear wheel arches and wheel placement define the truck’s stance and ground clearance. The wheels are positioned within defined arches, which is important for maintaining the vehicle’s proportions and off-road appearance. Misplacing or altering the wheel wells would distort the model’s realism.",
      "question": "Are the rear wheels positioned within distinct wheel arches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
