**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a vintage-style still life scene featuring a wooden desk with an open, aged book at the center. To the left stands an ornate brass desk lamp with a curved arm and decorative engravings on its shade and base. The lamp emits a warm, focused beam of light onto the open book. On the right side of the desk, two stacked books are visible—one dark blue leather-bound and one red—while a small, closed book lies to the left of the open one. The background consists of a dark teal wall with a floral wallpaper pattern in muted beige and brown tones, depicting stylized flowers and leaves. The lighting creates soft shadows and highlights, emphasizing the texture of the wood, leather, and metal. The overall color palette is warm and earthy, dominated by browns, golds, and deep blues, evoking a classic, scholarly atmosphere.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction specifies transforming the image into a **steampunk style**, which involves stylistic augmentation rather than complete replacement. Key changes include:
- Enhancing the **ornate brass lamp** with **cogs and gears** on its armature.
- Modifying the **book's pages** so they unfold like **mechanical schematics** with **cog-like margins**.
- Altering the **floral wallpaper** to feature **rivet patterns**.
- Retaining the **warm, vintage leather-and-brass color palette**.

From this, we can extract:
- **Allowed changes:**
  - The **form and structure** of the lamp’s armature (adding cogs and gears).
  - The **appearance of the book’s pages** (transformed into mechanical schematics with cogged edges).
  - The **design of the floral wallpaper** (replaced with rivet patterns).
  - **Stylistic enhancements** consistent with steampunk (e.g., industrial textures, mechanical motifs).

However, the instruction **explicitly preserves**:
- The **warm, vintage leather-and-brass color palette** → must remain intact.
- The **core objects**: lamp, open book, stacked books, wooden desk, and background wall — though their appearance may change, their **presence and spatial layout** are implied to be retained.

Therefore, **allowed changes list** includes:
- Addition of **cogs and gears** to the lamp’s armature.
- Transformation of **book page content and margins** into mechanical schematics with cog-like borders.
- Replacement of **floral wallpaper** with **rivet patterns**.
- Stylistic enhancement of **metallic sheen and industrial textures** in line with steampunk.

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
We now apply exclusion logic based on the allowed changes to identify what **must be preserved**.

**Core recognition elements:**
- The **open book** is central to the composition. While its pages may become schematics, its **physical presence**, **position on the desk**, and **open state** must remain. Changing its location or closing it would break the narrative focus.
- The **brass desk lamp** is iconic due to its **curved articulated arm**, **ornate shade**, and **base design**. Though cogs may be added, the **overall form and function** (lighting the book) must persist.
- The **wooden desk** must retain its **material texture**, **color**, and **position** as the foundational surface.
- The **stacked books** on the right and **small closed book** on the left are part of the scene’s balance and must remain in place, even if their covers are modified slightly.
- The **background wall** must remain present, but its **pattern** changes from floral to riveted; however, the **dark teal base color** and **texture** should stay consistent to preserve the mood.

**Functional/logical association elements:**
- The **lamp must still illuminate the book** — the **beam of light** must originate from the lamp and fall on the open book. This functional relationship is critical to the scene’s logic.
- The **spatial arrangement** — lamp on the left, book centered, books on the right — must be maintained for visual coherence.
- The **warm, vintage leather-and-brass color palette** is explicitly required to be retained. Therefore, **no drastic shifts in hue or tone** (e.g., turning the desk green or the lamp silver) are permitted.

**Non-modified element deduction:**
- Any unmentioned details not altered by instruction — such as the **grain of the wooden desk**, the **texture of the book’s leather cover**, the **shape of the lamp’s base**, or the **placement of the small book** — must be preserved unless directly affected by the steampunk transformation.

Thus, the following must remain unchanged:

**Preservation Targets List:**
- The **presence and position** of the open book on the desk.
- The **presence and position** of the brass desk lamp.
- The **wooden desk surface** with its grain and texture.
- The **stacked books** on the right and **closed book** on the left.
- The **direction and source** of the light beam from the lamp onto the book.
- The **overall warm, vintage color palette** (browns, golds, deep blues).
- The **basic shape and structure** of the lamp’s arm and base (though internal mechanics may be added).
- The **physical state** of the book (open, lying flat).
- The **wall surface** behind the desk (though pattern changes, base color and texture must remain).

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The open book is the central subject of the composition, and its physical presence is essential to the scene’s identity. Even if the pages transform into mechanical schematics, the book must remain open and centered on the desk. Losing this would fundamentally alter the scene’s purpose and narrative. Thus, the presence and open state of the book are core identity features, warranting a weight of 3 points.
    Question: Is the book physically present and open on the wooden desk?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The brass desk lamp is a key object whose form and function define the scene’s lighting and aesthetic. Although cogs may be added, the lamp must retain its original shape and position to maintain continuity. Its role as the light source is critical. If the lamp were removed or replaced, the scene’s logic collapses. Hence, its presence and structural integrity are core, earning a weight of 3 points.
    Question: Is the ornate brass desk lamp positioned on the left side of the desk, with its arm extended toward the book?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The wooden desk provides the foundational surface and anchors the entire composition. Its texture and color contribute to the vintage feel. Even with steampunk additions, the desk must remain wooden and in the same position. Altering its material or removing it would destroy the scene’s coherence. It is a key structural element, thus worth 2 points.
    Question: Is the desk made of wood with visible grain texture and located beneath all objects?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The stack of two books on the right and the single closed book on the left are compositional balancing elements. Their presence maintains symmetry and realism. While their covers may gain metallic accents, their positions and forms must remain. Removing them would disrupt the scene’s balance. They are important but not central, hence a weight of 2 points.
    Question: Are there two stacked books on the right side of the desk and one small closed book on the left?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The light beam from the lamp must still illuminate the open book, preserving the functional relationship between the lamp and the book. This is a logical necessity — without this, the scene loses its purpose. The direction and origin of the light must remain consistent. This is a critical functional element, hence 3 points.
    Question: Does the lamp emit a focused beam of light that falls directly onto the open book?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The warm, vintage leather-and-brass color palette is explicitly required to be maintained. This includes the golden hues of the lamp, the brown tones of the book covers and desk, and the deep blue of the wall. Even with steampunk additions, these colors must not shift drastically. Preserving this palette ensures stylistic consistency. It is a key directive, thus 3 points.
    Question: Are the dominant colors in the scene warm browns, golds, and deep blues, consistent with a vintage leather-and-brass aesthetic?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The background wall, though its pattern will change to rivets, must remain dark teal and textured. The wall’s presence and color are essential for depth and mood. Even if the floral pattern is replaced, the wall’s base color and surface must be preserved. This is a secondary detail but contributes to visual coherence, hence 1 point.
    Question: Is the wall behind the desk dark teal in color with a textured surface?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
