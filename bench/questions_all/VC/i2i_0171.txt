Description of reference image: The subject is a skier captured mid-action, skiing downhill in a dynamic stance. The skier wears a blue jacket, black ski pants, a helmet, and reflective goggles. They carry two ski poles and are equipped with skis. Snow powder sprays up around them as they carve through the slope. The backdrop features a stunning mountainous terrain covered in snow, with sharp peaks under a clear blue sky. The bright sun shines from the upper left corner, casting long shadows and enhancing the brightness of the scene.

Thinking process:
Based on the instruction, the skier's dynamic pose, attire, and equipment (skis, poles, etc.) will be transformed into an extreme sports figurine. Elements like the detachable skis, magnetic snow powder base, and packaging illustrations will be added. However, the skier's pose and some iconic elements must remain intact. The background is not explicitly required to be retained, so changes can be made there.

Allowed Changes List:
1. The transformation from a real-life skier to a figurine, altering physical proportions and materials.
2. Addition of detachable skis, a magnetic snow powder base, and packaging illustrations.
3. Modification of the background environment to accommodate the new figurine setting.

Step 2 - Determine the elements that should remain unchanged:

Thinking process:
1. Core recognition elements include the skier's pose (dynamic skiing action), the essential skiing gear (goggles, helmet, poles), and the skis themselves. These define the skier's identity and action.
2. Functional/logical association elements involve maintaining the skier’s interaction with the snowy slope, which supports the skiing activity logically.
3. Remaining elements such as the snow spray and skier’s outfit contribute to visual authenticity while not being core identifiers.

Preservation Targets List:
1. Dynamic skiing pose of the skier
2. Skiing gear (helmet, goggles, poles)
3. Skis attached to the figurine
4. Snow spray effect around the skier
5. Skier's outfit (blue jacket, black pants)

{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The skis are integral to the figurine's purpose as an extreme sports representation. Losing them would make the figurine unrecognizable as a skier.

    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The skier's outfit is a minor detail compared to the pose and gear but contributes to the visual accuracy of the figurine.
