      "thinking_process": "The en pointe stance is the defining physical feat of the ballerina’s pose and is central to identifying her as a dancer in mid-performance. The position of both feet on their toes, with the right foot slightly ahead, creates a distinct silhouette that must be preserved to maintain the integrity of the dance gesture. Losing this would fundamentally alter the action depicted, making it unrecognizable as ballet. This is a core functional element of the pose, hence assigned 3 points.",
      "question": "Are both feet positioned en pointe, with the right foot slightly ahead of the left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The lateral extension of the arms is a signature feature of classical ballet poses, contributing to the sense of balance and grace. The specific direction and curvature of the arms — extending outward with palms inward and fingers softly curved — are key to recognizing the pose. Altering this would disrupt the aesthetic and dynamic balance of the figure. It is a critical component of the dance posture, thus assigned 3 points.",
      "question": "Are both arms extended laterally from the body, with palms facing inward and fingers gently curved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The head turn to the left is a crucial detail in establishing the ballerina’s profile and direction of focus. This orientation is consistent with the natural flow of the pose and contributes to the three-dimensional sense of movement. Even in a sculpture, this angle must be preserved to retain the intended gaze and posture. It is a core spatial element of the pose, hence assigned 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the head turned to the left, with the chin slightly raised?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The straight alignment of the legs and spine is essential to the structural integrity of the en pointe stance. Any deviation in knee angle or spinal curve would compromise the realism and balance of the pose. Since the instruction requires retaining the dance pose, this anatomical alignment must remain unchanged. It supports the functionality of the stance, thus assigned 2 points.",
      "question": "Are the legs fully extended and aligned vertically, with the spine slightly arched backward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The relative positioning of the arms in relation to the hips and torso establishes the balance and symmetry of the pose. This spatial relationship ensures the figure appears harmonious and proportionate. While not as critical as the feet or head, it contributes significantly to the visual coherence of the ballet stance. It is a secondary but important compositional element, thus assigned 2 points.",
      "question": "Are the arms positioned at approximately hip level, extending outward from the sides of the torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The slight forward tilt of the upper body, combined with the elevation of the heels, creates the illusion of upward motion and balance. This subtle posture is characteristic of ballet technique and must be preserved to maintain the authenticity of the pose. Though minor, it affects the overall dynamics and should remain unchanged. Assigned 1 point as a detail-level consistency check.",
      "question": "Is the upper body slightly tilted forward while maintaining vertical alignment through the spine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
