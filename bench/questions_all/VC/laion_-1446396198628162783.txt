Description of reference image: The subject is a person wearing a full NASA space suit, standing in profile view facing right. The suit is white with red trim along the arms and legs, and features the NASA logo on the left shoulder. A large white backpack unit (likely a Portable Life Support System) is attached to the back, connected by coiled white hoses that run down the sides of the suit. The helmet is fully sealed and white, with a visor partially raised. The astronaut stands on a blue tarp covering the floor, positioned centrally in a cluttered workshop environment. Behind the figure, there is a wall painted with a large American flag motif (red, white, and blue with stars), a clock mounted on the wall, and various tools, storage containers, and equipment scattered across workbenches. On the far wall, two framed images are visible—one showing a map-like layout, possibly of a space facility or launch site, and another depicting a rocket launch. A red toolbox labeled “KLEIN” is visible on a shelf, alongside other mechanical and electronic components. The ceiling has fluorescent lighting and exposed ductwork.

Thinking process:  
First, analyze the editing instructions:  
- The instruction asks to **create an educational infographic titled "Journey to Space"** using the astronaut image as the **central element**, meaning the astronaut must remain present and recognizable.  
- It specifies transforming the **room into a mission control center**, which implies the background environment will be replaced or heavily modified.  
- It instructs adding **illustrative icons representing key training stages** (Physical Training, Technical Skills, Simulators, Space Suit Check), suggesting new graphical elements will overlay or surround the astronaut.  
- It requires **vibrant color-coded sections** for each stage, implying changes to the surrounding layout and color scheme.  
- However, it **does not mention altering the astronaut’s appearance**, suit details, or posture—only using them as the central visual anchor.  

Thus, allowed changes include:  
- Background transformation from workshop to mission control center  
- Addition of illustrative icons and text overlays  
- Color-coding of sections around the astronaut  
- Replacing or modifying environmental objects (tools, tables, walls)  

The astronaut’s **identity, suit design, posture, and key visual features** are not mentioned as changeable, so they must be preserved.

Allowed Changes List:  
- Background environment (workshop → mission control)  
- Wall decorations (American flag, framed pictures)  
- Workbench contents and tools  
- Floor surface (blue tarp may be replaced or overlaid)  
- Lighting and ceiling structure  
- Addition of infographic elements (icons, text, color blocks)

Step 2 - Determine the elements that should remain unchanged  
Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements:  
- The **NASA logo** on the left shoulder is a critical identifier of the organization and mission context. It is a branded emblem essential to the identity of the suit and its purpose. If removed or altered, the astronaut’s affiliation becomes ambiguous.  
- The **white space suit with red trim** is a signature design of NASA's Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU). Its shape, color, and markings define its authenticity and function. Any distortion would undermine its recognizability.  
- The **backpack unit (PLSS)** and **coiled hoses** are functional components of the suit; their presence confirms the suit’s operational readiness and realism. Removing or altering them would make the suit appear incomplete or fictional.  
- The **helmet and visor configuration** (partially raised) is a distinctive feature of the suit’s design and indicates the astronaut is in a ready state. This detail contributes to the realism and identity of the suit.  

Functional/logical association elements:  
- The **connection between the PLSS and the suit via hoses** must remain intact to preserve the logical functionality of the life support system. If disconnected or misrepresented, the suit appears non-functional.  
- The **astronaut’s stance and orientation** (standing upright, facing right) are important for maintaining spatial coherence in the infographic layout. Changing posture could disrupt the intended visual flow.  

Non-modified element deduction:  
All unmentioned suit details (e.g., gloves, boots, joints, zippers) must be retained unless explicitly stated otherwise. Since the instruction only adds overlays, these structural components must stay true to the original. The **blue tarp** underfoot is not referenced for modification, so it may be retained or subtly altered but should not be erased entirely if it supports the astronaut’s placement.

Preservation Targets List:  
- NASA logo on the left shoulder  
- White suit with red trim on arms and legs  
- Backpack unit (PLSS) with coiled hoses  
- Helmet with partially raised visor  
- Astronaut’s upright standing posture facing right  
- Connection of hoses from backpack to suit  
- Boots and gloves of the suit  
- Blue tarp beneath feet

    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The NASA logo is the primary organizational identifier on the suit. Its presence, shape, and placement on the left shoulder are critical for recognizing the astronaut as part of NASA’s program. Altering or removing it would misrepresent the agency and diminish the authenticity of the suit. This is a core identity element, making it essential to retain.
    Question: Is the NASA logo clearly visible on the left shoulder of the space suit?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The white suit with red trim is a defining characteristic of NASA’s EMU spacesuit. The color contrast and placement of red bands on the arms and legs are iconic and distinguish this suit from others. Losing this detail would make the suit unidentifiable as a NASA design, affecting both recognition and authenticity.
    Question: Are the red trim bands visible on the upper arm and lower leg of the space suit?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3

{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The backpack unit (PLSS) and the coiled hoses connecting it to the suit are essential functional components. Their presence ensures the suit appears fully equipped and operational. Removing or distorting them would make the suit appear incomplete or non-functional, undermining its credibility as a real space suit.
    Question: Is the white backpack unit attached to the back of the suit, with coiled white hoses extending down the sides?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The helmet with a partially raised visor is a distinctive feature of the suit’s design, indicating readiness and visibility. This specific configuration is important for identifying the suit as a modern NASA EMU. Changing it to a fully closed or open visor would alter the intended representation of the astronaut’s state.
    Question: Is the helmet’s visor partially raised, revealing part of the astronaut’s face?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2

    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The astronaut’s posture—standing upright, facing right—is crucial for maintaining spatial consistency in the infographic. This orientation allows for clear presentation of the suit’s side profile and integration into the layout. Altering the stance would disrupt the visual flow and potentially misalign with the infographic’s design.
    Question: Is the astronaut standing upright with their body oriented to the right side of the image?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2

{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The connection of the hoses from the backpack to the suit is a functional detail that must remain intact to preserve the realism of the life support system. Breaking this link would suggest the suit is not properly equipped, which contradicts its purpose in the infographic.
    Question: Are the hoses visibly connected from the backpack to the suit at the torso area?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The boots and gloves are integral parts of the suit’s structure and contribute to its completeness. While not as iconic as the logo or trim, their presence ensures the suit appears fully assembled and realistic. Omitting them would make the astronaut appear incomplete.
    Question: Are the astronaut’s boots and gloves visible and properly attached to the suit?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
