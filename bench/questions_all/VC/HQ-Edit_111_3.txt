Description of reference image: The subject is a vividly colored blue morpho butterfly, positioned centrally in the frame with its wings fully spread. The butterfly displays iridescent electric blue upper wing surfaces bordered by dark black edges, with fine venation patterns clearly visible across each wing segment. Its body is slender and dark, segmented into thorax and abdomen, with two thin antennae extending forward. The butterfly rests on a bright pink cosmos flower with delicate, layered petals radiating outward from a yellow central disc composed of stamens. Surrounding the main flower are several unopened pink buds on green stems, along with lush green foliage in the background that is softly blurred due to shallow depth of field. Sunlight filters through the scene from the top right, casting gentle highlights on the butterfly’s wings and flower petals, enhancing their vibrancy. The overall composition emphasizes natural beauty, color contrast, and ecological harmony.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions for explicit modifications allowed or required. The instruction specifies creating an educational infographic titled “Butterfly Biology Basics” using the vibrant blue butterfly as the central focus. It explicitly allows adding monochrome line-drawing overlays labeling anatomical parts (antennae, wings, abdomen, thorax), which means these labels can be superimposed but do not alter the original form of the butterfly. It also permits adding text boxes about pollination and botanical details such as pink petals—indicating that while new informational elements may be added, the visual core of the butterfly and flower must remain intact. Importantly, it states to "keep the visual theme delicate" and "emphasize the butterfly’s striking color as a focal point"—which implies the butterfly's color, shape, and position must not be distorted or replaced. The scene is not stated to be changed; instead, botanical details like pink petals are mentioned as part of the content to be included, suggesting they should remain visually present even if enhanced. Therefore, any transformation of the butterfly’s identity, color, or pose would violate the intent of retaining the original subject’s essence. Similarly, removing or altering the pink flower would contradict the specified ecological context.

Allowed Changes List:
- Addition of monochrome line-drawing overlays for labeled anatomical parts (antennae, wings, abdomen, thorax)
- Inclusion of text boxes describing pollination role
- Addition of botanical detail annotations related to pink petals
- Introduction of infographic layout elements (title, borders, layout structure)
- Adjustment of lighting or contrast to enhance clarity for educational purposes

Step 2- Determine the elements that should remain unchanged  
Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements: The butterfly is identified by its distinctive iridescent blue wings with black margins and intricate venation—a hallmark of the Morpho genus. This specific wing pattern and coloration are essential for public and scientific identification. Changing the hue or removing the blue iridescence would make it unrecognizable as a Morpho butterfly. Similarly, the pink cosmos flower with its layered petals and yellow center is a key botanical element tied to the butterfly’s feeding behavior and ecological interaction. Removing or altering this flower would disrupt the biological narrative implied by the instruction.  

Functional/logical association elements: The butterfly's positioning on the flower supports the functional logic of pollination. If the butterfly were removed from the flower or placed elsewhere without spatial coherence, the ecological message would be compromised. The connection between the butterfly and the flower is both visually and functionally critical. Thus, their relative placement and physical contact must be preserved.  

Non modified element deduction: After excluding the allowed additions (labels, text, overlays), all intrinsic features of the butterfly and flower—such as wing shape, petal structure, color distribution, and body segmentation—are not mentioned as changeable and therefore must remain. These elements are necessary for maintaining visual authenticity and biological accuracy in the final infographic. Even though style may shift toward educational clarity, the foundational imagery must stay true to the original.

Preservation Targets List:  
- The iridescent electric blue coloration of the butterfly’s wings  
- The black border outlining the wings  
- The full-winged, symmetrical posture of the butterfly with wings spread  
- The presence and structure of the pink cosmos flower beneath the butterfly  
- The physical contact between the butterfly and the flower  
- The yellow central disc of the flower with visible stamens  
- The surrounding unopened pink buds on green stems  
- The soft-focus green foliage background

    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The iridescent electric blue color of the butterfly’s wings is the most iconic and biologically defining feature of the Morpho species. It is responsible for the butterfly’s recognition in both nature and art. If this color is altered (e.g., desaturated, shifted to purple or green), the butterfly loses its identity. The instruction emphasizes preserving the "striking color as a focal point," so this feature must remain unmodified. This is a core identity element, hence weighted at 3 points.
    Question: Does the butterfly retain its original iridescent electric blue wing color?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The black border around the wings is a consistent morphological trait of the Morpho butterfly and contributes significantly to its visual distinction from other species. Removing or lightening this border would make the butterfly appear unnatural or misidentified. Since no instruction allows altering wing outlines, this feature must be preserved. It is a core structural identifier, thus weighted at 3 points.
    Question: Are the dark black edges along the outer margins of the butterfly’s wings preserved?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The butterfly is shown with wings fully spread and symmetrically aligned, which is crucial for displaying its full coloration and anatomical structure. Any folding, tilting, or asymmetry would misrepresent its natural resting state and hinder accurate biological representation. The instruction requires the butterfly as the central focus, implying its full display. This posture is essential for identification and educational clarity, so it must remain unchanged. Weighted at 3 points as a core identity feature.
    Question: Is the butterfly depicted with both wings fully extended and symmetrically open?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The pink cosmos flower serves as both a visual anchor and ecological context. Its presence under the butterfly illustrates feeding behavior and pollination dynamics. The instruction specifically mentions including "pink petals" to show feeding preference, meaning the flower must remain visually present. Altering its color, removing it, or replacing it with another plant would break the intended ecological narrative. This is a key scene element, so it must be retained. Weighted at 2 points as an important contextual element.
    Question: Is the bright pink cosmos flower directly beneath the butterfly still present and clearly visible?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The yellow central disc of the flower, composed of stamens, is a critical botanical detail indicating the reproductive structure of the cosmos. It provides evidence of the flower’s role in pollination. The instruction references the butterfly’s ecological role, making this feature relevant. Removing or altering it would mislead viewers about the flower’s biology. While not the most prominent feature, it is a key detail for scientific accuracy. Weighted at 2 points as an important functional detail.
    Question: Are the yellow stamens forming the central disc of the pink flower visible?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The physical contact between the butterfly and the flower is essential for illustrating the pollination interaction. The butterfly’s legs or body touching the flower surface reinforces the ecological relationship described in the instruction. If this contact is removed or obscured, the logical connection between the butterfly and the flower is broken. Though not a core identity feature, it is a functional and compositional necessity. Weighted at 2 points for maintaining scene logic.
    Question: Is the butterfly physically touching the surface of the pink flower?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The unopened pink buds surrounding the main flower provide environmental context and reinforce the idea of a thriving ecosystem. They contribute to the botanical richness of the scene and support the theme of floral diversity. Although not the primary focus, their presence adds depth and realism. The instruction mentions "botanical details," which includes such elements. Removing them would reduce visual coherence and ecological authenticity. This is a minor but supportive detail, so it is weighted at 1 point.
    Question: Are multiple unopened pink flower buds visible around the main flower?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}
{
    Q8: 
    Thinking process: The soft-focus green foliage in the background establishes the natural habitat and enhances depth perception. While the instruction does not require strict preservation of the background, it does emphasize keeping the visual theme "delicate" and focused on the butterfly. Disrupting the background with sharp lines or artificial textures could distract from the subject. Therefore, the general green tone and blurred leaf shapes should remain consistent. This is a secondary environmental detail, so it is weighted at 1 point.
    Question: Is the background composed of softly blurred green leaves, maintaining a natural garden ambiance?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
