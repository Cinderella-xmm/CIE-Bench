Description of reference image: The subject consists of two elephant figurines, one larger and one smaller, positioned side by side on a plain white background. Both elephants are stylized with a glossy, textured blue glaze that has a mottled appearance, resembling aged metal or patina. Their backs feature ornate circular designs composed of glittering gold and brown mosaic-like textures, bordered by thin golden trim. The ears, trunks, and tusks are highlighted with golden accents, especially around the edges and tips. Each elephant has a decorative band around its lower body, featuring intricate scrollwork in gold against the blue base. The elephants’ trunks are curled upward, and their eyes are dark and defined. The overall form is compact and stylized, with arched legs and no visible feet, suggesting they are designed as decorative objects. The surface texture includes subtle variations in color and reflective highlights, indicating a handcrafted finish.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions to determine what can be changed. The instruction explicitly states transforming the elephants into high-end fragrance bottle designs—this means the **form** of the subject (elephant shape) is allowed to change into a **bottle shape**, and the **function** shifts from decorative object to product packaging. It specifies modifying the **texture** (glittering surface → glass mosaic), **material perception** (metallic glaze → glass), **addition of branding elements** (logo on trunk, label), and **design features** (gold-trimmed caps resembling ears). The scene (white background) is not mentioned for retention, so it may be altered. However, the **core identity** of the elephants—such as their shape, posture, and key design motifs—must still be derivable from the original to maintain visual consistency with the transformation logic. Therefore, changes are permitted in **form**, **texture**, **material**, **functional labeling**, and **scene**, but **iconic visual traits** tied to the original must remain identifiable.

Allowed Changes List:
- Form of the elephants (transformed into curved bottles)
- Surface texture (glittering pattern → glass mosaic)
- Material appearance (blue metallic glaze → transparent/glass-like)
- Addition of brand logo and fragrance name label
- Gold-trimmed caps shaped like elephant ears
- Background environment (not required to be preserved)
- Proportion and scale (can be adjusted for product design)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thinking process:
Core recognition elements: The original elephants have distinct visual characteristics that define their identity—most notably the **upward-curled trunks**, **large flared ears**, **golden tusks**, and **ornate back mosaic patterns**. These features are essential to identifying them as elephants in this artistic style. Even if transformed into bottles, the **trunk's curve**, **ear-like cap**, and **mosaic back design** must retain enough similarity to anchor the transformation. The **golden trim** and **scrollwork bands** are also stylistic signatures that contribute to the unique aesthetic. If these are completely removed or replaced without resemblance, the edited version loses connection to the original.

Functional/logical association elements: The **position of the trunk** (curled upward) and **placement of the mosaic pattern** on the back are not just decorative—they are functional in defining the animal’s silhouette and orientation. In the new design, the trunk becomes a spout or neck of the bottle, so its **shape and position** must remain consistent to preserve logical continuity. The **back mosaic** becomes part of the bottle’s surface decoration, so its **location and shape** should be retained even if material changes.

Non modified element deduction: After excluding allowed changes (form, texture, material, labels, background), the remaining unmentioned visual elements include the **specific shape of the ears**, **tusk placement**, **eye position**, **overall body silhouette**, and **decorative band detail**. These are not explicitly changed in the instructions, and altering them would disrupt visual coherence. They serve as anchors between the original and the transformed version.

Preservation Targets List:
- The upward-curved trunk shape
- The large, flared ear shape
- The location and oval shape of the back mosaic pattern
- The presence of golden tusks
- The decorative band with scrollwork at the base
- The eye placement and dark coloring
- The relative size ratio between the two elephants

    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The upward-curved trunk is a core identification feature of the elephants in the original image. It defines the posture and directionality of the figure and is central to the stylized representation. Even when transformed into a fragrance bottle, the trunk’s curve must be preserved to maintain the visual link to the original subject. Losing this shape would make the transformation unrecognizable as an elephant-derived design.
    Question: Is the trunk of each elephant still curved upward in the same manner as in the original?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The large, flared ears are iconic to the elephant’s profile and are specifically referenced in the editing instruction as being repurposed into "gold-trimmed caps." This indicates the ear shape must be preserved in form, even if functionally reimagined. The outline and position of the ears are critical to maintaining the elephant identity.
    Question: Are the ears of both elephants still present in their original flared shape and position?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The mosaic-like pattern on the back is a distinctive decorative feature that differentiates these elephants from others. Its oval shape, central placement, and golden border are key design elements. The instruction mentions converting this into a glass mosaic, which implies the **shape and location** must be retained, even if texture changes. Removing or relocating it would break the visual continuity.
    Question: Is the oval-shaped mosaic pattern located on the back of each elephant, centered and bordered by gold trim?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The golden tusks are small but significant details that reinforce the elephant’s identity. Their presence, color, and placement near the mouth are consistent across both figures. While the instruction allows material changes, the **presence and position** of the tusks must be preserved to maintain fidelity to the original design.
    Question: Do both elephants retain golden-colored tusks positioned near the mouth?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The decorative band with scrollwork at the base is a consistent stylistic element across both figures. It contributes to the ornamental quality and helps define the lower edge of the body. Although the instruction allows material transformation, the **band’s presence and pattern** must remain to preserve the design language.
    Question: Is there a decorative band with scrollwork pattern around the lower body of each elephant?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The eye placement and dark coloring are essential for facial recognition and expression. The eyes are clearly defined and positioned on the sides of the head, contributing to the overall character of the figurines. Changing their position or removing them would alter the identity of the subject.
    Question: Are the eyes of both elephants positioned on the sides of the head and colored dark?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}

{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The relative size difference between the two elephants (larger and smaller) suggests a parent-offspring relationship or a pair. This proportional relationship is visually important for composition and narrative. The instruction does not mention resizing, so the **size ratio** should be preserved to maintain balance and context.
    Question: Is the larger elephant positioned to the left and the smaller one to the right, maintaining their original relative size?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
