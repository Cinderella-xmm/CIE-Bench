Description of reference image: The subject is an ancient amphitheater with a semi-circular arrangement of stone seating tiers leading up to a multi-tiered wall structure featuring numerous arches. The amphitheater is surrounded by lush greenery, with trees framing the scene on both sides. The sky above is partly cloudy, with patches of blue visible. The stone material has a weathered texture, and the arches are evenly spaced across the wall.

### Step 1 - Allowed Changes List:

Thinking process: The instructions specify transforming the amphitheater into a kawaii enamel pin design. This means the form of the amphitheater can be stylized, and glossy metal outlines and bright enamel colors can be added. The scene background is replaced with a white background, and the square mockup layout is introduced. However, the core shape and iconic features of the amphitheater must remain recognizable.

Allowed Changes List:
Specific element 1 that allows for changes: The texture and color of the stone material can be changed to bright enamel colors.
Specific element 2 that allows for changes: The background can be changed to a white background.
Specific element 3 that allows for changes: The proportions and angles can be adjusted to fit a kawaii style while maintaining recognizability.
Specific element 4 that allows for changes: The addition of glossy metal outlines around the design.

### Step 2 - Preservation Targets List:

Thinking process: Core recognition elements include the semi-circular seating arrangement, the tiered wall with arches, and the overall shape of the amphitheater. Functional/logical association elements include the relationship between the seating and the stage area. Remaining elements like the arch spacing and the general layout should also be retained for visual coherence.

Preservation Targets List:
(Element 1 that should be maintained): The semi-circular arrangement of seating.
(Element 2 that should be maintained): The tiered wall with arches.
(Element 3 that should be maintained): The relationship between the seating and the stage area.
(Element 4 that should be maintained): The even spacing of the arches.
(Element 5 that should be maintained): The overall shape and outline of the amphitheater.

### Step 3 - Question Generation:

Q1:
