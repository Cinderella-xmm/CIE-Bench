This specific arrangement of facial muscles and skin texture is unique to her and essential for recognition. If altered, especially in terms of the shape of the smile or the depth of wrinkles, the subject would no longer be identifiable as the same person. This is a key identity feature and thus carries a weight of 3 points.",

Any change in color (e.g., gray or darkened) or style (e.g., longer or disheveled) would alter her appearance significantly. Since it is not mentioned in the editing instructions as something to be changed, it must be preserved. This is a core recognition element, hence weighted at 3 points.",

Their shape, position on the face, and lens color are visually prominent and help distinguish her. Removing or altering them would compromise recognition. As they are not specified for change, they must remain unchanged. This is a key accessory element, so it receives a weight of 3 points.",

This gesture and detail contribute to the authenticity and emotional tone of the portrait. While the clothing may be modified, the hands’ position and appearance are not mentioned for alteration.

The instruction does not specify changing the background, so it must remain intact. The spatial relationship between the subject and the path, as well as the blurred trees, supports visual consistency. This is an important scene element, thus weighted at 2 points.",

Although the texture and pattern may be redesigned, the structural outline must remain to preserve the garment’s identity as a qipao.
