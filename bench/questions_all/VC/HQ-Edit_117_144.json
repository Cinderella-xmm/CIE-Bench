In any artistic transformation, including cartoon style, their presence is essential for recognition. Losing them would make the figure unrecognizable as the original subject. Therefore, this is a 3-point question.",

      "thinking_process": "The upright posture with the right hand holding an object and the left hand in the pocket is a defining compositional feature. It conveys dignity and balance. Any deviation would alter the character’s demeanor and spatial logic. This is a critical structural element, thus weighted 3 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The layered clothing structure — overcoat, sweater vest, shirt, tie, and trousers — defines the man’s formal attire. While colors may change to pastel tones, the **structure and order** of garments must remain to preserve identity. Altering the layering would misrepresent the original outfit. This is a key identity element, hence 3 points.",
      "question": "Does the man wear a long overcoat over a sweater vest, shirt, tie, and trousers?",

      "thinking_process": "The oval-shaped reflective pool is a central environmental anchor. It frames the subject and reflects the ambient light. Its presence establishes the setting and spatial context. Removing or distorting it would break the scene’s coherence. Though stylized, its shape and function must remain. Thus, it is a 2-point element.",

      "thinking_process": "The cobblestone path under the man’s feet grounds him in the scene and maintains continuity with the environment. Even if stylized, the path must exist to preserve spatial logic. Its absence would disconnect the figure from the setting. This is an important scene element, so it receives 2 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The man’s position at the edge of the pool, facing forward, is crucial for the composition. It ensures visual balance and directs focus. Moving him away from the pool or changing his orientation would disrupt the intended framing. This is a logical spatial relationship, thus 2 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The object in the man’s right hand must be held in the same manner regardless of transformation (cane → scepter). The act of holding is functional and compositional. If the hand were empty or the object misplaced, the action would be lost. This is a functional association, hence 2 points.",
