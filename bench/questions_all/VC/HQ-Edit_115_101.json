      "thinking_process": "The symmetrical floral and scrollwork pattern is the defining visual characteristic of the watch's casing. It is not just decorative but structurally organized in a radial fashion, forming a continuous band around the central dial. This pattern is specifically mentioned to be preserved as embossed on the bottle. Losing this exact design would result in a loss of identity and artistic continuity, making the edited object unrecognizable as derived from the original. Hence, this is a core identity feature.",
      "question": "Is the radial floral and scrollwork pattern with symmetrical swirls and leaf-like motifs present around the central area of the object?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The Roman numerals (I to XII) are key functional and stylistic elements of the original clock face. Although the instruction replaces the face with a label, it explicitly requires that Roman numerals appear around the label’s edge. Their specific sequence and circular arrangement are essential to maintaining the temporal theme and visual consistency with the original. Without them, the thematic link between time and \"Timeless Reserve\" breaks down.",
      "question": "Are the Roman numerals I through XII arranged in a circular sequence around the central label or design element?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The embossed texture of the engravings gives the object its three-dimensional character and luxurious feel. The instruction specifies that these engravings become \"embossed patterns\" on the bottle, meaning their physical depth and raised nature must be visually preserved. If flattened or simplified, the transformation loses authenticity and fails to honor the original craftsmanship.",
      "question": "Do the decorative patterns exhibit clear embossed relief with visible depth and shadowing, indicating raised surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The central circular motif, originally housing the clock face, is a structural anchor point. Even though it becomes a label, the instruction implies it remains a focal point. Its position at the geometric center of the object maintains compositional balance. Removing or displacing it would disrupt the radial symmetry and weaken the design’s coherence.",
      "question": "Is there a clearly defined central circular element positioned at the geometric center of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The dense arrangement of small dots and flourishes within the scrollwork adds richness and complexity to the design. These minor details contribute to the ornate aesthetic and distinguish it from simpler patterns. While not core identifiers alone, their absence would make the design appear simplified or inaccurate, affecting visual fidelity.",
      "question": "Are small decorative dots and filigree details integrated into the scrollwork, particularly at junctions and tips of curves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
