### Description of Reference Image:
The subject consists of four brightly colored skis with intricate, vibrant patterns leaning against a snow-covered rock near a frozen river in a snowy forest setting. The skis display a mix of bold colors like orange, blue, red, and yellow, with swirling and geometric designs. Two wooden hockey sticks lie in the foreground on the snow. The background features bare trees covered in snow, a frozen river, and an overall serene winter landscape.

### Thinking Process:
The editing instructions specify transforming the skis and hockey sticks into avant-garde footwear while retaining their vivid patterns and wooden textures. This means the form of the skis and hockey sticks can change, but their distinctive patterns and textures must be preserved. The scene is not required to be retained, allowing for changes to the background and setting.

#### Allowed Changes List:
- The form of the skis and hockey sticks can be redesigned into footwear.
- The scene and background can be altered or replaced.
- The size, proportion, and angle of the skis and hockey sticks can be adjusted.

#### Preservation Targets List:
- The vibrant patterns and colors on the skis.
- The wooden texture of the hockey sticks.
- The overall shape and structure of the skis and hockey sticks (to some extent, as they are transformed into footwear).
