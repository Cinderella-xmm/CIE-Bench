### Description of Reference Image:
The subject is a man dressed in a black suit and shirt, standing on a beach during sunset. He has his hair tied back and is holding a red cloth. To his left is a vintage film camera mounted on a tripod. The background features a serene ocean with gentle waves and a setting sun casting golden hues across the horizon.

### Thinking Process:
The editing instructions specify transforming the individual into five chibi-style Russian nesting dolls while retaining certain elements. The scene's background and some key objects must also be preserved. Therefore, the subject's transformation is allowed, but his attire, stance, and the surrounding objects must be represented in the chibi dolls. The scenic beach sunset background must remain consistent.

#### Allowed Changes List:
- The individual's physical form can be changed into chibi-style Russian nesting dolls.
- The size and proportions of the nesting dolls can vary, with the largest doll representing the original subject and progressively smaller ones nested inside.
- The positioning of the nesting dolls can be adjusted to fit atop a wooden table.

### Thinking Process:
Core recognition elements include the man's black suit and shirt, his stance, and the red cloth he holds. Functional/logical elements include the tripod-mounted camera and the beach sunset background. Remaining elements like the ocean waves and the sun's position should be retained for visual coherence.

#### Preservation Targets List:
- The man's black suit and shirt.
- His stance and the red cloth.
- The tripod-mounted camera.
- The beach sunset background.
