      "thinking_process": "The moko kauae facial tattoos are the most culturally significant and visually distinct feature of the warrior, serving as a core identity marker. Their specific spiral and angular patterns, particularly around the eyes, nose, and jaw, are unique to Māori tradition and define the character’s status and lineage. Any alteration to these patterns—such as simplification, removal, or repositioning—would fundamentally change the character’s identity and render him unrecognizable as a traditional Kaitiaki figure. This element is therefore critical for cultural and visual identification, warranting the highest weight.",
      "question": "Is the facial moko kauae tattoo pattern with symmetrical spirals and angular lines clearly visible and intact, covering the forehead, cheeks, and chin?",

      "thinking_process": "The full-body moko designs on the chest, shoulders, and arms are integral to the warrior’s appearance and represent spiritual and ancestral connections. These swirling patterns are not merely decorative but carry symbolic meaning. Removing or distorting them would compromise the authenticity of the character. Since the instruction explicitly requires keeping “bold moko patterns,” their preservation is mandatory. The exact shapes, density, and flow of the spirals must remain consistent with the original.",
      "question": "Are the intricate moko patterns on the chest, shoulders, and upper arms present with continuous swirling and curved motifs matching the original design?",

      "thinking_process": "The flax piupiu skirt is a key cultural garment associated with Māori ceremonial dress. Its layered, textured construction from dried flax blades is visually distinctive and functionally tied to the haka performance. Changing its material, layering, or color would break cultural accuracy. The instruction specifies retaining the skirt, so its structural integrity and texture must be preserved.",
      "question": "Is the flax piupiu skirt composed of layered, light brown dried flax strands hanging in tiers, secured by a red-brown woven belt with a central metallic buckle?",

      "thinking_process": "The flax leg wraps are secondary but still important accessories that complete the traditional attire. They are made of similar fibrous material and serve both aesthetic and functional roles during movement. Their presence contributes to the authenticity of the warrior’s costume. While less prominent than the skirt or tattoos, they are part of the required traditional ensemble and must be retained.",
      "question": "Are thick, shaggy flax leg wraps present on both lower legs, reaching approximately mid-calf and matching the texture of the piupiu skirt?",

      "thinking_process": "The wide haka stance is not just a pose but a ritualized expression of strength and challenge. The bent knees, splayed arms, and extended fingers are essential components of this action. Altering the posture—such as straightening the legs or raising hands differently—would destroy the intended dramatic effect and cultural significance. The instruction explicitly mentions preserving this stance, making it a functional and visual necessity.",

The steep, forested slopes, mist, and natural lighting establish a sense of place. While the instruction allows stylization, it requires retaining the layered green-valley backdrop. Thus, the overall topography, vegetation density, and atmospheric depth must remain recognizable.",

It is a specific environmental detail that supports the naturalistic setting. While not a core identity feature, its presence helps maintain visual consistency and grounding. Removing it would disrupt the compositional balance and suggest a different location.",
