      "thinking_process": "The scientist's posture—specifically, her right hand holding a pipette while looking down at the test tubes—is the core functional gesture indicating scientific activity. This is not just a pose but a behavioral identifier of her role. If this action is altered (e.g., hands empty, no pipette), the image loses its narrative coherence and identity as a researcher at work. It is a key identity feature, making it a 3-point element.",
      "question": "Is the scientist depicted with her right hand holding a pipette or similar instrument, angled toward the test tubes?",

      "thinking_process": "The test tube racks with teal-colored liquids are central to the laboratory setting. Their vertical alignment and grouping in metal racks are distinctive and functional. Removing or altering their shape or color would undermine the scientific context. The teal color is also specified in the instruction as a key tone, so its retention is critical. This is a core scene element, hence 3 points.",
      "question": "Are there multiple test tubes arranged in metal racks, containing teal or greenish-blue liquid?",

      "thinking_process": "The microscope on the right side of the bench is a functional object tied to scientific observation. Its presence grounds the scene in realism and supports the scientist’s role. Even in semi-cartoon style, its silhouette and position must be preserved to maintain logical consistency. This is an important scene element, so weight is 2.",
      "question": "Is there a microscope visible on the right side of the workbench, with an eyepiece and stage clearly defined?",

      "thinking_process": "The digital screens behind the scientist display distinct circular, symmetrical molecular structures—these are not generic patterns but specific scientific visuals that define the high-tech lab. They are iconic representations of research data and must be preserved to maintain thematic integrity. Their loss would remove a key contextual clue. This is a 2-point element due to its importance in scene identification.",
      "question": "Are there two digital screens in the background displaying circular, intricate, symmetrical molecular or crystalline patterns in blue-green tones?",

Without them, the character could be misread as a technician or student. This is a core identity feature, hence 3 points.",

This color choice is not incidental but intentional for visual cohesion. Altering it to another hue would break the intended scientific aesthetic. Though not a structural element, it is a critical detail for visual consistency, so it is a 2-point element.",

Changing this arrangement (e.g., moving the microscope to the left) would disrupt the functional flow of the lab. This is a key compositional element, affecting how the viewer interprets the environment. Therefore, it is a 2-point element.",
