      "thinking_process": "The coiled circular posture is the defining compositional feature of the carving. It creates a continuous, flowing form that distinguishes this piece from other fish carvings. If this looped structure is broken or altered, the work loses its unique visual identity. This is a core structural element directly tied to the subject’s recognition.",
      "question": "Is the fish depicted in a continuous, coiled circular posture with its head pointing toward the upper right and tail curving beneath it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The barbels (whiskers) are iconic features of catfish and are clearly carved near the mouth in the original. Their presence is crucial for identifying the species and maintaining biological accuracy in the representation. Removing them would misrepresent the subject.",
      "question": "Are there three distinct barbels extending from the lower jaw of the fish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The dorsal fin is a prominent feature positioned along the back of the fish and contributes to its overall silhouette. Its shape and placement are consistent with the anatomy of a catfish and help define the profile. Altering it would affect the realism and recognizability of the fish.",
      "question": "Is the dorsal fin located along the upper back of the fish and shaped with a serrated edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The scale pattern is intricately carved along the body and is a key detail that adds texture and realism. While the material may change, the pattern’s layout and directionality should be preserved to maintain the visual fidelity of the original design.",
      "question": "Are the scales arranged in overlapping rows along the body of the fish, running from head to tail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The tail curves under the body to complete the circular loop, forming a closed shape. This specific positioning is part of the design’s symmetry and balance. Any deviation would disrupt the intended composition.",
      "question": "Does the tail of the fish curve underneath the body and connect near the head, completing a nearly full circle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The pectoral fins are visible on the sides of the fish and contribute to its three-dimensional appearance. Their position and shape are consistent with the anatomy of the species and should be retained to preserve the integrity of the figure.",
      "question": "Are there two pectoral fins visible on the side of the fish, one near the head and one further back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The square wooden plaque serves as the base for the carving and frames the design. Although the material may change, the overall rectangular shape and framing function should remain to preserve the context of the artwork.",
      "question": "Is the fish carving contained within a square-shaped panel with rounded corners?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
