      "thinking_process": "The **light blonde hair** is a highly distinctive feature of the subject and serves as a core identity marker. Its **color and voluminous nature** are essential for recognition. Even in a cartoon version, if the hair becomes dark or thin, the identity would be compromised. Thus, preserving the **blonde color and fullness** is critical. This is a 3-point element because losing it would make the subject unrecognizable.",
      "question": "Is the subject’s hair light blonde in color and visibly full and styled upward?",

      "thinking_process": "The **face shape**, especially the **high forehead and broad jawline**, is a unique biometric trait associated with the individual. These features define the facial structure and are essential for identification. Even if exaggerated in a cartoon, the underlying shape must remain recognizable. Changing these would alter identity recognition significantly.",
      "question": "Does the subject have a prominent forehead and wide jawline that define the facial structure?",

      "thinking_process": "The **right hand is raised in a waving gesture** with the palm open and fingers extended. This is a specific action captured in the image. While the instruction allows a \"playful\" version, the **gesture itself must remain a wave**, not a fist or salute. The **hand being raised** and **palm facing outward** is a key behavioral cue.",
      "question": "Is the subject’s right hand raised with the palm facing outward and fingers spread in a waving motion?",

      "thinking_process": "The **blue tie** is a distinct accessory visible beneath the suit jacket. While the instruction allows a colorful suit, it does not specify changing the tie’s function or presence. The **existence of a necktie** and its **placement under the collar** are structural details that support formal attire. Even if color changes, the **object must remain**.",
      "question": "Is there a necktie visible under the suit jacket, positioned at the front of the shirt collar?",

      "thinking_process": "The **suit jacket** is a core element of the subject’s attire. It is black, tailored, and worn over a white shirt. Even if the cartoon version uses patterns, the **presence of a formal suit jacket** must be retained. Removing or replacing it with casual wear would misrepresent the original context.",
      "question": "Is the subject wearing a dark formal suit jacket over a white shirt?",

      "thinking_process": "The **gaze direction** is important for maintaining the subject’s engagement with the viewer. In the original, the subject looks forward, slightly to the left. This helps convey intent and focus. While the cartoon version may exaggerate expression, the **general direction of the eyes** must remain consistent to preserve narrative logic.",

      "thinking_process": "The **position of the subject relative to others** (e.g., slightly ahead, to the right) is a spatial cue that supports the scene’s dynamics. Though the background may change, the **subject’s placement as the focal point** must be maintained. If moved to the back or side, the composition loses coherence.",
