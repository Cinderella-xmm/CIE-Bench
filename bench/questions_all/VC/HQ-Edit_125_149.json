      "thinking_process": "The river is a core element of the scene, serving as the foundational landscape feature under the bridge. Its presence is required for the transformation to make sense—roots descending into the stream imply the river must exist. If the river were removed or relocated, the entire ecological logic of the guardian creature merging with nature would collapse. Therefore, preserving the river’s location and flow is a **core identity requirement** for the scene’s coherence.",
      "question": "Is the river present beneath the bridge, flowing from the background toward the foreground with visible white water over mossy rocks?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The moss-covered rocks in the river are distinctive visual markers that anchor the natural setting. Their texture and placement contribute to the scene’s realism and depth. Since the instruction mentions “mossy roots descending into the flowing stream,” the existing moss on rocks supports this transformation and must remain to maintain continuity. Removing them would break the visual link between the original and transformed states.",
      "question": "Are there moss-covered rocks visible in the river, especially near the center and right side of the frame?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The fallen logs on the riverbanks are key environmental details that enhance the untamed forest atmosphere. They are not part of the bridge but are integral to the scene’s composition. Since they are not mentioned in the editing instructions, they must be preserved to maintain visual consistency. Their absence would make the scene feel artificially cleaned or staged.",
      "question": "Are multiple fallen logs visible along the left and right riverbanks, some partially submerged in the water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The dense forest canopy with dappled sunlight is a defining atmospheric feature. It creates the mood and lighting conditions of the scene. The instruction does not specify changing the sky or light, so this ambient effect must be retained. Losing the dappled light would alter the entire tone and believability of the forest environment.",
      "question": "Is there a canopy of green leaves overhead, allowing dappled sunlight to filter down onto the bridge and river?",

      "thinking_process": "The leaning tree trunks on the left side of the image are unique compositional elements that frame the bridge and add dynamism. Their presence suggests natural growth interacting with the structure. Since they are not mentioned in the transformation instructions, they must remain to preserve the original spatial relationships and prevent the scene from feeling disconnected.",
      "question": "Are there several large, moss-covered tree trunks leaning toward the bridge from the left bank, with one prominently curving over the structure?",

      "thinking_process": "The low-angle perspective emphasizes the bridge’s height and dominance in the scene. This viewpoint is crucial for conveying scale and drama. While the bridge’s form may change, the camera angle must remain consistent to preserve the viewer’s experience. Altering the perspective would fundamentally change how the transformation is perceived.",
      "question": "Is the image captured from a low-angle viewpoint, looking upward at the bridge from near the river level?",

      "thinking_process": "The bridge spans the river, connecting two forested banks. This spatial relationship is essential for the scene’s logic. Even if the bridge becomes a creature, it must still appear to span the river. Removing this connection would make the transformation nonsensical.",
      "question": "Does the bridge structure extend horizontally across the river, supported by towers on both sides, forming a continuous span?",
