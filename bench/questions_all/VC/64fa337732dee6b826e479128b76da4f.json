      "thinking_process": "The woman’s facial features — particularly her oval face, almond-shaped eyes, straight nose, and serene expression — are critical for identifying her as the original subject. These features are not mentioned in the editing instructions as being changed, and altering them would fundamentally transform the identity of the person depicted. Since this is a portrait, facial recognition is paramount. Losing these features would make the subject unrecognizable, hence a weight of 3 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The dark hair styled in an updo with a blue ribbon is a defining feature of the subject’s appearance. It matches the color of the dress and is a key part of the portrait’s aesthetic harmony. The instruction allows modification of the gown and jewelry but does not mention changing the hairstyle. Therefore, the hairstyle must be retained. Its loss would disrupt the visual cohesion and identity of the figure. This is a core identity element, hence 3 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The off-the-shoulder neckline is a hallmark of the dress style and contributes to the subject’s elegance and period-specific fashion. While the instruction says to simplify the gown into oversized frills, it does not specify removing the off-the-shoulder cut. Thus, the neckline must remain, even if stylized. Its presence defines the garment’s silhouette and is essential to the original composition. This is a key structural element, so it receives 2 points.",
