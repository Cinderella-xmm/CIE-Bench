### Step 1 - Analyzing the Allowed Changes 

**Description of reference image:** The subject is a muscular male figure dressed in a detailed, black armor suit with metallic and gold accents, standing powerfully. He holds a glowing hammer that emits blue lightning. The character has long blond hair, a beard, and wears a red cape draped over his shoulders. The background is a dramatic sky with clouds illuminated by sunlight.

**Thinking process:** The instructions indicate transforming the character into a plastic figurine while keeping the same standing pose and adding it to a desk scene with lighting effects. The background and environment of the original image can thus be replaced. Other than the figurine's material and size change, the posture, costume design, hammer, and notable accessories are expected to stay consistent.

**Allowed Changes List:**
- The background can be replaced with a desk setting.
- The character's material can change to resemble plastic.
- Lighting effects are to be added around the figurine.
  
### Step 2 - Determining Elements That Should Remain Unchanged

**Thinking process:** Core recognition elements here would include the iconic features of Thor – his armor, hammer, cape, and general appearance. Functional elements, such as the hammer’s design and the way it is held, must also remain as they define Thor. Secondary details like specific textures and colors, while not core, should still be preserved for visual coherence.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
- The detailed design of Thor's armor  
- The glowing hammer with blue lightning  
- The red cape draped over the shoulders  
- Thor's standing pose  
- The beard and long blond hair
