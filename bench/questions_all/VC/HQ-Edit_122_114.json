      "thinking_process": "The window’s position at the top center of the house is a core architectural feature that defines the house’s symmetry and visual balance. It is a fixed element in the original image and not mentioned in the editing instructions as being removed or relocated. Its retention ensures the house remains recognizable and maintains its original design logic. Loss of this window or its relocation would fundamentally alter the house’s identity.",
      "question": "Is the window located at the top center of the house?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The chimney’s placement on the left side of the roof is a distinctive landmark that anchors the house’s spatial orientation. It is not mentioned in the instructions as being removed or moved, so it must remain. Its preservation is essential for maintaining the original scene’s integrity and preventing confusion about the house’s structure.",
      "question": "Is the chimney positioned on the left side of the roof?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The A-frame roof shape is a defining characteristic of the house’s silhouette. Although the roof may gain copper pipes, its overall triangular form must remain unchanged to preserve the house’s identity. Altering the roof’s angle or removing the peak would make the structure unrecognizable.",
      "question": "Does the house have an A-frame roof with a pointed peak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The central circular opening in the house, where the nest is placed, is a critical spatial feature that allows the stork to be visible. This opening is not mentioned for removal or modification, and its presence is necessary for the stork to be housed within the structure. Its retention ensures the logical relationship between the stork, nest, and house remains intact.",
      "question": "Is there a large circular opening in the front of the house where the nest is located?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The stork’s position inside the nest is a functional and compositional centerpiece. Even if transformed into a mechanical form, it must remain within the nest to maintain the original narrative. Moving the stork outside or altering its containment would break the symbolic meaning of the scene.",
      "question": "Is the stork located inside the nest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The presence of the path and yellow flowers in the foreground provides environmental context and visual grounding. Though minor, they contribute to the scene’s realism and continuity. Their absence would create a gap in the setting, making the image feel incomplete or inconsistent with the original.",
      "question": "Are there yellow flowers and a path visible in the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The background trees and sky texture establish the natural setting of the image. They are not mentioned for alteration, and their retention ensures the scene remains cohesive. Removing or drastically changing them would disconnect the house from its environment.",
      "question": "Are green trees and a textured sky visible in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
