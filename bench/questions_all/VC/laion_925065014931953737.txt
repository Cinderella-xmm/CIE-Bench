**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a male figure in the iconic Superman costume, standing upright with a confident posture, facing slightly to the right. He wears a textured dark blue suit with a prominent red and gold "S" shield emblem centered on the chest. The suit features a detailed, scale-like texture across the torso and arms, with silver metallic accents along the sides and waist. A red cape drapes over his shoulders and flows behind him. His black hair is neatly styled, and he has a strong jawline with a serious expression. The background includes an outdoor urban setting: a paved road, greenery, a partially visible American flag painted on a wall, a stop sign, and a building with a flat roof under a bright sky with scattered clouds. The lighting is natural daylight, casting soft shadows.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction explicitly states:  
- Transform the character into a **chibi-style fridge magnet**, implying a complete change in form, scale, and artistic style.  
- Emphasize the **iconic suit and cape**, indicating these elements should remain recognizable but stylized.  
- Maintain the **"S" symbol prominently on the chest with bright primary colors**, meaning the symbol must be preserved in location and identity, though color saturation may increase.  
- Add **exaggerated, simplified features**: oversized head, small limbs — this allows for drastic changes in proportions.  
- Use **vibrant blues and reds**, suggesting color palette can be intensified.  
- Add **thick black outlines** — this is a stylistic addition not present in the original.  
- The scene is not mentioned as required for retention; therefore, the **background environment can be changed or removed**.

From this, we deduce:

**Allowed Changes List:**  
- Character’s body proportions (e.g., oversized head, stubby limbs)  
- Artistic style (from realistic to chibi/cartoonish)  
- Color intensity (brighter blues, reds)  
- Addition of thick black outlines  
- Background elements (can be replaced or omitted)  
- Overall size and format (fridge magnet implies small, flat object)  
- Facial features (simplified, cartoonish eyes, mouth)  
- Texture details (realistic fabric textures can be replaced with flat fills)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
We now identify what **must not be altered**, based on exclusion from the allowed changes list and core recognition logic.

**Core recognition elements:**  
- The **"S" symbol** on the chest is the central icon of Superman. It is the most universally recognized element of the character. Even in chibi form, it must remain identifiable as the classic "S" shield. Its position (center chest), shape (shield with curved "S"), and basic color scheme (red outer border, yellow/gold center, red inner "S") are essential. While the instruction allows for brighter colors, the **form and placement** cannot change.  
- The **suit's overall silhouette** — particularly the **cape** and **chest emblem** — defines the character visually. Though stylized, the **presence of the cape flowing from the shoulders** and the **distinctive armored look of the suit** must be retained for identification.  
- The **color scheme** — while enhanced, the **primary use of blue, red, and gold/yellow** is part of Superman’s identity. The instruction specifies maintaining vibrant versions of these, so they are not optional.

**Functional/logical association elements:**  
- The **relationship between the "S" emblem and the suit** — the emblem is embedded within the suit, not floating. This spatial relationship must be preserved to maintain logical coherence.  
- The **cape’s attachment point** — it must originate from the shoulders, consistent with how capes are worn. In chibi style, it may be simplified, but its origin must be clear.

**Non-modified element deduction:**  
- **Texture details** such as the scale-like pattern on the suit are **not required** to be preserved because the instruction calls for a simplified, cartoon style. Thus, they are allowed to be removed.  
- **Background elements** like the American flag, stop sign, and buildings are **not specified for retention**, so they can be changed or removed.  
- **Facial features** (like specific jawline or eye shape) are not required to be preserved due to the chibi transformation.

However, the **core visual identity markers** — especially the **"S" shield**, **cape**, and **color palette** — must remain recognizable despite stylization.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
- The presence and shape of the "S" emblem on the chest  
- The red cape attached at the shoulders  
- The blue suit with red and gold accents  
- The positioning of the "S" emblem centrally on the chest  
- The color contrast between red, blue, and gold/yellow

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

Q1:  
Thinking process: The "S" emblem is the definitive symbol of Superman. Its unique shield shape with a red outer border, yellow/gold inner field, and red "S" lettering is the core identifier. Any loss of this shape or placement would make the character unrecognizable. Even in chibi style, this symbol must retain its fundamental form and position. Therefore, this is a key identity element with weight 3.  
Question: Is the "S" emblem present on the chest of the character, with a shield shape, red outer border, yellow/gold inner field, and red "S" lettering?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3

Q2:  
Thinking process: The red cape is a signature feature of Superman, distinguishing him from other characters. It must originate from the shoulders and flow behind him. In chibi form, it may be simplified, but its presence and attachment point are essential for recognition. Removing or altering its origin would disrupt identity. This is a major identity element, thus weight 2.  
Question: Is there a red cape attached at the shoulders and extending downward behind the character?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2

Q3:  
Thinking process: The blue suit is the base of Superman’s costume. While texture may be simplified, the dominant color and form must remain. The instruction emphasizes vibrant blues, so the blue color must still be present. Losing the blue suit would make the character unidentifiable. This is a key component of the costume, hence weight 2.  
Question: Is the character wearing a predominantly blue suit that covers the torso and arms?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2

Q4:  
Thinking process: The gold/yellow trim around the "S" emblem and possibly the belt is a distinctive detail. While not as critical as the emblem itself, it contributes to the iconic design. The instruction mentions bright primary colors, so gold/yellow must be retained in key areas. Its absence would reduce visual accuracy. This is a secondary but important detail, so weight 1.  
Question: Are there gold or yellow accents present on the "S" emblem and/or the belt area of the suit?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1

Q5:  
Thinking process: The character’s pose — standing upright with arms at sides — is not strictly defined in the instruction, but the instruction does not allow for dramatic repositioning. However, since the transformation is to a chibi magnet, posture may be simplified. But the **overall orientation** (facing forward) and **limb positioning** (arms down) are implied by the original stance. Since the instruction allows exaggerated limbs, this is not a core requirement. However, the **relative position of the head and torso** must remain coherent. This is a minor detail, so weight 1.  
Question: Is the character depicted in an upright stance with arms positioned at the sides of the body?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1

Q6:  
Thinking process: The **color contrast** between red, blue, and gold is essential to Superman’s visual identity. The instruction specifies vibrant primary colors, so these hues must be preserved. If the colors were muted or reversed, the character would not be recognizable. This is a functional aspect of the costume’s design, so weight 2.  
Question: Are the dominant colors of the costume red, blue, and gold/yellow, with high contrast between them?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2

Q7:  
Thinking process: The **placement of the "S" emblem** directly on the chest is non-negotiable. Moving it to the back or side would violate the character’s established design. The instruction requires it to be “prominently” displayed, confirming its central position. This is a core spatial feature, so weight 3.  
Question: Is the "S" emblem located centrally on the chest of the character?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3
