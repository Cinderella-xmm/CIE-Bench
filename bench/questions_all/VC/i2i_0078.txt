The watch has a black and silver design, featuring a white face with black markings for hours and minutes, a date window, and a metallic bracelet.

### Step 1: Allowed Changes List  
Thinking process:  
The instruction explicitly states replacing the background with a steampunk-style train station waiting room. Therefore, the current background elements like the couch, pillows, plant, and window can be changed. However, the original lighting and shadows of the watch need to be preserved.

Allowed Changes List:  
Specific element 1 that allows for changes - Couch and pillows in the background  
Specific element 2 that allows for changes - Potted plant on the windowsill  
Specific element 3 that allows for changes - Window and natural light

### Step 2: Determination of Elements That Should Remain Unchanged  
Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements include the wristwatch’s design, position, and lighting/shadows. Functional/logical association elements involve maintaining the watch on the white surface. Non-modified elements include the watch's bracelet, dial, and positioning on the table for visual coherence.

Preservation Targets List:  
(Element 1 that should be maintained) - The wristwatch's black and silver design  
(Element 2 that should be maintained) - White watch face with black markings  
(Element 3 that should be maintained) - Metallic bracelet  
(Element 4 that should be maintained) - Position of the watch on the white surface  
(Element 5 that should be maintained) - Original lighting and shadows of the watch
