      "thinking_process": "The brand name \"MICHAEL KORS\" is the primary identifier of the watch's origin and model. It is centrally placed below the 12 o’clock marker and is critical for recognizing the product. Removing or altering it would misrepresent the item, making it unidentifiable as a Michael Kors watch. Thus, it is a core identity feature with a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the text \"MICHAEL KORS\" present in uppercase letters below the 12 o'clock position on the dial?",

      "thinking_process": "The three subdials at 3, 6, and 9 o’clock are functional components defining the chronograph nature of the watch. Their specific positions and internal markings (24-hour, seconds, minutes) are unique to this model. Changing their layout or values would alter the watch’s identity and functionality. Hence, preserving their arrangement and content is essential, assigning a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Are there three subdials located at the 3, 6, and 9 o'clock positions, with the 3 o'clock subdial marked 24-hour scale, the 6 o'clock subdial marked seconds, and the 9 o'clock subdial marked minutes?",

      "thinking_process": "The rectangular date window at 4 o’clock displaying \"18\" is a distinctive feature of this watch model. Its precise location and shape contribute to the visual signature. Altering its position or content would disrupt the original design. As a key identifying detail, it deserves a weight of 3 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The black leather strap with crocodile texture and visible stitching is a prominent aesthetic element distinguishing this watch from others. The texture and stitching pattern are consistent across the band and contribute to the luxury appearance. While the strap may be stylized in the comic, its fundamental characteristics must remain. This is a secondary but important detail affecting brand perception, so it receives a weight of 2 points.",
      "question": "Does the watch have a black leather strap with an embossed crocodile texture and visible stitching along the edges?",

      "thinking_process": "The silver metallic finish of the case and dial is a core visual trait that defines the watch’s elegance and material quality. Changing the color or texture would fundamentally alter its appearance and brand alignment. Although the comic may use shading, the base silver tone must persist. This is a critical identity feature, thus weighted at 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the watch case and dial finished in a silver metallic tone with a brushed texture?",

      "thinking_process": "The outer minute track with numerical markings from 5 to 60 is a standard feature on chronographs and helps define the precision of the watch. Its presence reinforces the functional design. While minor artistic liberties might be taken in the comic, the track must remain intact. This is a functional detail that supports the watch’s identity, assigned a weight of 2 points.",
      "question": "Is there a continuous minute track around the outer edge of the dial with markings from 5 to 60?",

      "thinking_process": "The Arabic numerals at 12, 2, 4, 8, and 10 o’clock are key design elements that distinguish this model’s minimalist yet readable dial. Their positions and shapes are integral to the watch’s look. Even in a cartoon version, they should retain their original placement. This is a significant detail contributing to visual recognition, earning a weight of 2 points.",
      "question": "Are the numbers 12, 2, 4, 8, and 10 displayed as Arabic numerals at their respective positions on the dial?",

      "thinking_process": "The two pushers and crown on the right side of the case are functional components of a chronograph. Their presence confirms the watch’s type and operation. They must remain in their correct positions to preserve the mechanical logic. This is a functional detail tied to the watch’s identity, so it is given a weight of 2 points.",
