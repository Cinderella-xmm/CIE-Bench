Description of reference image: The image features two cartoon bears sitting closely together on a grassy field under a clear sky with a few floating clouds. Both bears appear fluffy and friendly, with the larger bear on the left and a smaller bear on the right. They have round faces, small ears, and paws with visible paw pads. Surrounding them are small flowers, including daisies, and the lighting suggests it is either early morning or late afternoon, giving the scene a warm and cozy atmosphere.

Thinking process:
Based on the given instruction, the primary modification involves designing the bears as plush toys and adding a cute scarf. The scene elements and other intrinsic details must remain consistent unless specifically altered by the instructions. Thus, the bear's overall shape, scene positioning, and interaction must remain largely unchanged while adding new design features.

Allowed Changes List:
Specific element 1 that allows for changes: The texture of the bears can be adjusted to reflect a plush toy material.
Specific element 2 that allows for changes: A cute scarf accessory can be added around the neck of the bears.
Specific element 3 that allows for changes: Fine details such as facial expressions or color shades may be slightly adjusted to align with the plush toy design.

Thinking process:
Core recognition elements (like the bears’ round bodies, fluffy appearance, and warm setting) should be retained as they are essential for recognizing the subject. Functional/logical association elements include their position and interaction, as altering these could disrupt the scene’s logic. Remaining elements based on visual coherence, such as the background and flowers, should also be preserved.

Preservation Targets List:
(Element 1 that should be maintained: Round and fluffy body shape of the bears)
(Element 2 that should be maintained: Grass ground and daisy flowers surrounding the bears)
(Element 3 that should be maintained: Bears seated closely together, showing companionship)
(Element 4 that should be maintained: Clear sky background with soft clouds)
