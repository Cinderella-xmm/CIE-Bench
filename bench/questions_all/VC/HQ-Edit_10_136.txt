**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a young woman with shoulder-length brown hair featuring bangs, seated cross-legged on a fluffy white cushion placed on the floor in front of a bed. She wears a loose-fitting light blue t-shirt and wide-leg blue jeans, barefoot. Her eyes are closed, and she holds an acoustic guitar across her lap, gently strumming it with her right hand. The guitar has a natural wood finish with a black pickguard and a dark fretboard. A silver pendant necklace hangs around her neck. Behind her, the wall is covered with a collage of music-related posters and photos, including one prominently displaying “GERLESIES” and another labeled “KIRKA IN SHADOW.” The room features soft pink walls, wooden flooring, a small white round side table to her left holding a bottle of orange liquid and a pencil, sheer peach-colored curtains over a window letting in bright daylight, and string lights above the poster wall. A white bed with a floral-patterned pillow is partially visible to the right. A white shag rug lies beneath the cushion.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction specifies several transformations:  
- "Cartoonize the girl" → This implies altering the rendering style (e.g., line art, exaggerated proportions), but not changing her identity or core form.  
- "Gently playing the guitar with an enlarged strumming hand" → The action (playing guitar) must remain, but the **hand size** is to be modified.  
- "Enhance the wall posters with vibrant band logos in watercolor" → The **posters themselves** are to be stylized, but their **presence and arrangement** should remain.  
- "Add a whimsical cat silhouette in pastel on the bed" → This is a new element; the bed’s existence is implied as a location for the addition.  
- "Include a small, decorative writing box overlayed on the bedside table" → This adds a new object on the existing table.  

Thus, the following elements are allowed to change:
- Style of the girl (cartoonization)
- Size of the strumming hand (enlarged)
- Visual style of the wall posters (watercolor treatment)
- Addition of a cat silhouette on the bed
- Addition of a writing box on the bedside table

Allowed Changes List:  
(Specific element 1 that allows for changes): The artistic style of the girl (from realistic to cartoonish)  
(Specific element 2 that allows for changes): The size of the girl’s strumming hand (to be enlarged)  
(Specific element 3 that allows for changes): The visual style of the wall posters (to be enhanced with watercolor band logos)  
(Specific element 4 that allows for changes): The addition of a pastel cat silhouette on the bed  
(Specific element 5 that allows for changes): The addition of a decorative writing box on the bedside table

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
Core recognition elements:  
- The **acoustic guitar** is central to the scene — its presence and function (being played) must remain. Even if cartoonized, it must retain its basic shape (wooden body, sound hole, fretboard).  
- The **girl’s posture and position**: sitting cross-legged on a cushion in front of the bed, facing slightly forward, holding the guitar — this spatial relationship is essential to the narrative and must not be altered.  
- The **bed** and **cushion** are key structural elements defining the space; they must remain in place and recognizable.  
- The **window with sheer curtains** and **natural light source** establish the ambient lighting and environment — these must stay to preserve the setting’s mood.  
- The **side table**, **bottle**, and **pencil** are functional props; while a writing box may be added, the original items must still exist.  
- The **wall collage** must remain in terms of layout and placement, even if re-styled. The text “GERLESIES” and “KIRKA IN SHADOW” are iconic identifiers of the posters and must be preserved.  
- The **flooring** (wooden planks) and **rugs** (white shag) define the room’s texture and depth — these should not be removed or replaced.  

Functional/logical association elements:  
- The **guitar-playing action** must remain logical: the hands must still interact with the strings and fretboard, even if one hand is enlarged.  
- The **position of the girl relative to the bed and table** must remain consistent to maintain spatial coherence.  
- The **lighting direction** from the window must remain consistent to preserve realism in the cartoonized version.  

Non-modified element deduction:  
All elements not explicitly allowed to change (such as the exact color of the shirt, the shape of the cushion, the pattern on the pillow, the brand name on the bottle) must be retained unless specified otherwise. Since no such changes are mentioned, they must remain.

Preservation Targets List:  
(The girl’s overall posture and seating position on the cushion)  
(The presence and shape of the acoustic guitar)  
(The wall collage layout and the visibility of “GERLESIES” and “KIRKA IN SHADOW” text)  
(The window with sheer curtains and natural light coming through)  
(The white side table with the bottle and pencil)  
(The wooden floor and white shag rug)  
(The bed with floral pillow and white bedding)  
(The girl’s clothing: light blue t-shirt and wide-leg jeans)  
(The silver pendant necklace)

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

Q1:  
Thinking process: The acoustic guitar is the central object in the scene and defines the activity. Its wooden body, sound hole, and fretboard are core identifying features. Even if cartoonized, these must remain intact to preserve the object's identity. Loss of the sound hole or incorrect shape would make it unrecognizable as a guitar, which is critical to the scene’s narrative.  
Question: Is the acoustic guitar present with a visible sound hole and fretboard?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The girl’s seated posture on the fluffy white cushion is essential to the composition. Changing her position (e.g., standing or lying down) would disrupt the intended cozy bedroom atmosphere and break the visual narrative. The cross-legged pose is a key identifier of her relaxed state.  
Question: Is the girl sitting cross-legged on a fluffy white cushion?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The wall collage, particularly the posters with the texts “GERLESIES” and “KIRKA IN SHADOW,” are unique identifiers of the room’s aesthetic and cultural context. These texts must remain legible and positioned in the same area to preserve the authenticity of the scene, even if stylized.  
Question: Are the words “GERLESIES” and “KIRKA IN SHADOW” visible on the wall posters?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The window with sheer peach-colored curtains and the bright daylight entering from it establishes the time of day and lighting condition. Removing or altering the curtain color or window shape would change the ambiance and affect the overall mood of the scene.  
Question: Is there a window with sheer peach-colored curtains allowing bright daylight to enter?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The white round side table with a bottle of orange liquid and a pencil is a key detail that anchors the scene’s realism. While a writing box may be added, the original objects must remain visible. Their absence would alter the scene’s logic and reduce visual coherence.  
Question: Is there a white round side table with a bottle of orange liquid and a pencil on it?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The wooden flooring and white shag rug define the room’s texture and spatial depth. Changing the floor material or removing the rug would significantly alter the environment’s feel and disrupt continuity.  
Question: Is the floor made of wooden planks with a white shag rug on top?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The bed with white bedding and a floral-patterned pillow is a structural element that provides context for the room. Even with a cat silhouette added, the bed’s appearance must remain consistent.  
Question: Is there a bed with white bedding and a floral-patterned pillow visible to the right of the girl?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q8:  
Thinking process: The girl’s clothing — specifically the light blue t-shirt and wide-leg blue jeans — contributes to her identity and casual style. Changing these would alter her appearance beyond recognition.  
Question: Is the girl wearing a light blue t-shirt and wide-leg blue jeans?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q9:  
Thinking process: The silver pendant necklace is a personal accessory that adds detail to the character’s appearance. While minor, its presence contributes to visual consistency and character definition.  
Question: Is the girl wearing a silver pendant necklace?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1
