      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "The three-masted configuration with multiple tiers of sails is the defining architectural feature of the ship. It distinguishes it from smaller vessels or different types of ships. If the number or arrangement of masts is changed, the ship would no longer be recognizable as the same vessel. This is a core identity element, critical for visual recognition, hence assigned 3 points.",
      "question": "Does the ship retain exactly three masts, with sails arranged in tiers on each mast?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The hull’s distinctive shape — particularly the raised stern and carved prow — is a key identifier of the galleon-style ship. Altering this would fundamentally change the ship’s identity. These features are not just aesthetic but functional in historical ship design, making them core to recognition. Thus, this is a 3-point element.",
      "question": "Is the ship’s hull shaped with a raised stern and a decorated, upward-curving prow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The number and placement of sails are essential to the ship’s rigging system and visual balance. Changing their count or position would disrupt the ship’s authenticity and make it unrecognizable. While the material of the sails can change (to papercraft), their number and location must remain fixed. This is a core structural detail, hence 3 points.",
      "question": "Are there multiple sails on each of the three masts, with at least two tiers per mast?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The presence of seagulls flying around the ship is a key environmental element that establishes the maritime setting. Although their form may change to wire-suspended models, their spatial presence must be preserved to maintain the narrative context. Their absence would break the scene’s coherence, making this a 2-point important element.",
      "question": "Are there at least five seagulls visible in flight around the ship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The ship’s orientation — facing left with the bow angled forward — is crucial for conveying direction and movement. Reversing or rotating it would alter the viewer’s perception and break continuity with the original image. This directional posture is a key compositional element, hence 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the ship oriented such that the bow points toward the left side of the image and is slightly elevated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The portholes along the hull are small but distinctive details that confirm the ship’s function as a warship or trading vessel. They contribute to the realism and identity of the ship. While minor, their removal would reduce visual fidelity and coherence. This is a secondary but identifiable detail, hence 1 point.",
      "question": "Are there visible portholes along the sides of the ship’s hull?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The ship must appear to float above the water surface, even if the water is replaced with resin. This spatial relationship is logical and necessary for maintaining the illusion of a vessel on the sea. Disrupting this would break the scene’s logic. This is a functional association element, hence 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the ship positioned above the surface of the water/resin layer, appearing to float?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
