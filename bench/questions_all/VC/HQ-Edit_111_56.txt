**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a young ballerina viewed from the back, standing en pointe in a ballet studio. She wears a pale pink tutu with layered tulle, a corset-style bodice with thin spaghetti straps and lacing at the back, white tights, and pointe shoes with ribbons wrapped around her ankles. Her hair is styled in a neat bun atop her head. Her arms are slightly extended outward in a graceful ballet pose, with hands gently curved. The setting features a plain light-colored wall, wooden floorboards running horizontally, and a partial view of a ballet barre on the left side. Soft lighting comes from the left, casting subtle shadows and highlighting the contours of her form. The overall composition emphasizes elegance, balance, and classical ballet posture.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction explicitly states:  
- “Transform the ballerina into a classical Greek sculpture” → This means the **form and material** of the subject must change (from human to marble statue), but **the dance pose must be retained**.  
- “Complete with intricate robes and a stylized laurel wreath” → New clothing and headwear will replace the original ballet attire, so the **ballet costume (tutu, bodice, tights)** is allowed to change.  
- “Enhance the sculpture's marble texture with subtle chisel marks” → The **surface texture** of the figure will change, but the **underlying pose and silhouette** must remain consistent.  
- “Position her amidst an ancient Greek temple setting with Ionic columns and a mosaic floor” → The **background environment** must be replaced entirely.  
- “Retain the dance pose” → The **posture and orientation** of the body (including leg position, arm extension, head turn) must remain unchanged.

From this, we deduce:
- The **subject’s identity** changes from a living ballerina to a sculpture, so **all organic textures, colors, and materials** (skin tone, fabric, hair) can be altered.
- However, the **dance pose** (specifically: en pointe stance, arms outstretched, head turned slightly to the left, weight balanced on toes) must be preserved.
- The **original background elements** (wooden floor, wall, barre) are not required to be kept — they are to be replaced by a Greek temple scene.
- The **spatial relationship** between the figure and its surroundings must shift to reflect the new setting, but the **figure’s internal structure and positioning** (e.g., right leg slightly forward, left arm angled down) must stay identical.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
- Subject’s form: transformed from human to marble sculpture  
- Subject’s clothing: replaced with classical Greek robes and laurel wreath  
- Subject’s surface texture: changed to marble with chisel marks  
- Subject’s hair: replaced with laurel wreath or sculpted hairstyle  
- Background: replaced with ancient Greek temple (Ionic columns, mosaic floor)  
- Lighting: may be adjusted to suit the new environment  
- Color palette: shifted to match stone and architectural tones

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
We now identify what **must not change**, based on exclusion from the allowed changes list and logical necessity.

**Core recognition elements:**  
Although the subject is being transformed into a sculpture, the **dance pose** is explicitly instructed to be retained. This includes:
- The **position of the feet**: both on pointe, right foot slightly ahead, heels lifted
- The **alignment of the legs**: straight and elongated, knees locked
- The **arm positions**: both arms extended laterally, palms facing inward, fingers slightly curved
- The **head orientation**: turned to the left, chin slightly raised

These constitute the **core identity of the action** — the ballet pose itself. Even if the figure becomes a statue, the **pose defines the purpose** of the transformation. If the pose is distorted, the edit fails the instruction.

**Functional/logical association elements:**  
- The **balance and weight distribution** implied by the en pointe stance must remain intact. Changing the leg angles would make the pose physically impossible for a sculpture to represent realistically.
- The **spatial relationship** between limbs must preserve the grace and symmetry of ballet — any alteration would break the logic of the movement.

**Non-modified element deduction:**  
Even though the costume, hair, and texture are changing, certain **anatomical proportions and spatial relationships** must remain:
- The **length ratio** of arms to torso
- The **angle of the spine** (slightly arched backward)
- The **placement of hands relative to hips**
- The **direction of gaze** (looking forward-left)

These are not mentioned as changeable and are essential to maintaining the **visual coherence** of the original pose.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
- The en pointe stance with both feet on pointe, right foot slightly forward  
- The lateral arm extension with hands curved and palms inward  
- The head turned to the left, chin slightly raised  
- The straight alignment of legs and spine  
- The relative positioning of arms, torso, and legs forming a balanced ballet posture

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The en pointe stance is the defining physical feat of the ballerina’s pose and is central to identifying her as a dancer in mid-performance. The position of both feet on their toes, with the right foot slightly ahead, creates a distinct silhouette that must be preserved to maintain the integrity of the dance gesture. Losing this would fundamentally alter the action depicted, making it unrecognizable as ballet. This is a core functional element of the pose, hence assigned 3 points.
    Question: Are both feet positioned en pointe, with the right foot slightly ahead of the left?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The lateral extension of the arms is a signature feature of classical ballet poses, contributing to the sense of balance and grace. The specific direction and curvature of the arms — extending outward with palms inward and fingers softly curved — are key to recognizing the pose. Altering this would disrupt the aesthetic and dynamic balance of the figure. It is a critical component of the dance posture, thus assigned 3 points.
    Question: Are both arms extended laterally from the body, with palms facing inward and fingers gently curved?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The head turn to the left is a crucial detail in establishing the ballerina’s profile and direction of focus. This orientation is consistent with the natural flow of the pose and contributes to the three-dimensional sense of movement. Even in a sculpture, this angle must be preserved to retain the intended gaze and posture. It is a core spatial element of the pose, hence assigned 3 points.
    Question: Is the head turned to the left, with the chin slightly raised?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The straight alignment of the legs and spine is essential to the structural integrity of the en pointe stance. Any deviation in knee angle or spinal curve would compromise the realism and balance of the pose. Since the instruction requires retaining the dance pose, this anatomical alignment must remain unchanged. It supports the functionality of the stance, thus assigned 2 points.
    Question: Are the legs fully extended and aligned vertically, with the spine slightly arched backward?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The relative positioning of the arms in relation to the hips and torso establishes the balance and symmetry of the pose. This spatial relationship ensures the figure appears harmonious and proportionate. While not as critical as the feet or head, it contributes significantly to the visual coherence of the ballet stance. It is a secondary but important compositional element, thus assigned 2 points.
    Question: Are the arms positioned at approximately hip level, extending outward from the sides of the torso?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The slight forward tilt of the upper body, combined with the elevation of the heels, creates the illusion of upward motion and balance. This subtle posture is characteristic of ballet technique and must be preserved to maintain the authenticity of the pose. Though minor, it affects the overall dynamics and should remain unchanged. Assigned 1 point as a detail-level consistency check.
    Question: Is the upper body slightly tilted forward while maintaining vertical alignment through the spine?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
