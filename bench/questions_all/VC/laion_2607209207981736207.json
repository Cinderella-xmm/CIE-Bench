      "thinking_process": "The Fujitsu fi-7160 model name and logo are the primary identifiers of the device. Their absence or alteration would make the holographic representation unrecognizable as this specific model. The text \"Fujitsu\" and \"fi-7160\" are clearly visible in the original image and must be preserved in the hologram to maintain product identity.",
      "question": "Is the \"Fujitsu fi-7160\" model name and logo visibly present on the top-left portion of the scanner in the holographic display?",

      "thinking_process": "The open ADF tray holding multiple documents is a defining structural feature of the scanner. Its presence confirms the scanner's function and distinguishes it from other models. Removing or altering this component would change the device’s recognizability.",
      "question": "Is the automatic document feeder (ADF) tray open and holding multiple documents, including a boarding pass, receipt, and payment slip, in the holographic display?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The control panel with specific buttons (Menu, Stop/Clear, Scan/Enter, Power, and directional arrows) is a key functional identifier. The layout and labeling are unique to this model and essential for recognition. Altering this would misrepresent the device.",
      "question": "Are the five control buttons (Menu, Stop/Clear, Scan/Enter, Power, and directional navigation) arranged in the same configuration on the right side of the scanner in the holographic display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The green illuminated power button is a distinctive visual cue indicating the scanner is powered on. It is a consistent feature across images of this model and contributes to functional recognition. Its absence would reduce authenticity.",
      "question": "Is the power button illuminated in green on the right-side control panel of the scanner in the holographic display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The bristle roller array beneath the scanning glass is a mechanical detail that identifies the paper-feed system. While subtle, it is a unique feature of this scanner model and supports functional accuracy in the hologram.",
      "question": "Is the row of bristle rollers visible beneath the scanning bed of the scanner in the holographic display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The specific documents in the ADF (boarding pass, receipt, payment slip) are not just placeholders but provide context for the scanner’s use. Their visible text and layout help identify the scanner's purpose and must be preserved for consistency.",
      "question": "Are the boarding pass, receipt, and payment slip clearly visible in the ADF tray with readable text such as \"Boarding Pass\", \"Receipt\", and \"Payment Slip\" in the holographic display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The black and light gray color scheme is characteristic of the Fujitsu fi-7160 and contributes to its visual identity. While the packaging may have iridescent effects, the holographic representation must preserve the original coloration for accurate identification.",
      "question": "Does the scanner in the holographic display maintain the original black and light gray color scheme of the Fujitsu fi-7160?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
