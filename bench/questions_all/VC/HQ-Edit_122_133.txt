Description of reference image: The subject consists of two birds positioned side-by-side in a split-frame composition. On the left, a male Northern Cardinal perches on a snow-laden pine branch. Its plumage is vivid red with a black mask around the eyes and throat, a bright orange-red beak, and a prominent crest dusted with snowflakes. Snow clings to its back and head, emphasizing its texture and form. The cardinal faces right, slightly angled toward the viewer, with detailed feathering visible along its wings and tail. The background features a muted winter forest scene with bare trees and falling snow, creating a soft, atmospheric depth.

On the right, a Blue Jay rests on a similarly snowy pine branch, facing left. It has striking blue and white plumage, with a sharp crest, black facial markings, and a pale underbelly. Its wings display intricate patterns of blue, black, and white barring, and its tail is long and striped. Snow rests lightly on its back and the surrounding branches. The background is brighter, with a clear blue sky, scattered clouds, and sunlit pine cones and needles. Both birds are depicted with hyper-realistic detail, including individual feathers, reflections, and texture contrast between fur, snow, and bark.

Thinking process: First, analyze the instructions that clearly state what can be changed. The instruction specifies transforming the cardinal and blue jay into **3D anthropomorphic figurines**, which means their **biological forms** (e.g., bird shape) can be altered. They are to be dressed in **Victorian-style winter attire**, so clothing and accessories are new additions allowed by the edit. The setting changes from natural winter scenes to a **split-frame shadow box** with specific micro-sets: a **frosty stage with icicles** for the cardinal and a **cozy pine-scented alcove** for the blue jay. This implies the **background environment**, including the original forest and sky, is not required to be preserved. The instruction also allows **miniature seasonal elements** to be added around each scene, indicating these are newly introduced rather than retained.

Therefore, allowed changes include:
- Transformation of birds into anthropomorphic 3D figurines
- Dressing them in Victorian winter clothing (including stitching, accessories)
- Replacing the natural outdoor backgrounds with stylized shadow-box interiors
- Adding new decorative elements like icicles, miniature pine cones, etc.
- Changing lighting and atmosphere to match indoor diorama settings

Allowed Changes List:
- Bird anatomy (to anthropomorphic form)
- Clothing and accessories (Victorian style)
- Background environments (replaced with shadow box scenes)
- Presence of new seasonal decorations (icicles, tiny pinecones, etc.)
- Lighting and overall ambiance (shift from natural to curated indoor)

Step 2 – Determine the elements that should remain unchanged  
Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements: The **identity of the birds** must remain recognizable despite transformation. Even as anthropomorphic figures, they must retain **key visual identifiers** that confirm they are a **Northern Cardinal** and a **Blue Jay**. These include:
- The **bright red coloration** of the cardinal, especially the crest, face, and body — this is essential for species identification.
- The **blue and white plumage pattern** of the blue jay, particularly the barred wing pattern and crest shape.
- The **distinctive black facial mask** of both birds (cardinal's black throat and eye area; blue jay’s black line through the eye).
- The **shape of the beak**: short, conical, and orange-red in the cardinal; slightly longer and black in the blue jay.

These features are **core identity markers** that distinguish these birds from others. If lost, the subjects would no longer be identifiable as cardinal or blue jay.

Functional/logical association elements: While the scene is being replaced, the **spatial relationship** between the two birds — one on the left, one on the right — is implied by the "split-frame" structure. This layout is specified in the instruction ("split-frame shadow box"), so the **side-by-side positioning** must be preserved. However, since the frame itself is part of the new design, the exact physical placement within the frame is flexible as long as the division remains.

Non-modified element deduction: After excluding all allowed changes, the following **original visual elements** must be retained:
- The **color palette** of the cardinal (vivid red with black mask)
- The **plumage pattern** of the blue jay (blue crest, white cheeks, barred wings)
- The **presence of snow** on the birds' bodies and branches — though the snow may be reinterpreted in the new scene, it must still appear as a key environmental feature
- The **branch structure** they perch on — while possibly stylized, the general shape of pine branches with needles must be present to maintain ecological context

Preservation Targets List:
- The cardinal’s bright red body color and black facial mask
- The blue jay’s blue crest, white cheeks, and barred wing pattern
- The presence of snow on the birds’ heads and backs
- The distinct beak shape and color of each bird
- The pine branch structure beneath each bird
- The side-by-side split-frame layout

    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The cardinal’s bright red plumage is its most iconic identifying feature, universally recognized as the defining trait of the Northern Cardinal. Losing this color would make the bird unidentifiable as a cardinal, regardless of other details. The red must be preserved even if transformed into a figurine, as it is the core identity marker.
    Question: Is the cardinal’s body predominantly bright red with a black facial mask?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The blue jay’s distinctive blue crest and barred wing pattern are critical for species identification. These features are unique among North American birds and must be retained to preserve the bird’s identity. Even in anthropomorphic form, the blue and white pattern must be present.
    Question: Does the blue jay have a blue crest and wings with alternating blue and white bars?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3

{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The presence of snow on the birds’ heads and backs is a key environmental detail from the original image, reinforcing the winter theme. Although the snow may be reimagined in the shadow box, its presence on the birds must be maintained to preserve continuity with the original scene.
    Question: Is there visible snow resting on the cardinal’s head and back?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The blue jay’s beak is black and slightly curved, distinguishing it from the cardinal’s orange-red beak. This morphological detail is essential for accurate species representation. Even in stylized form, the beak color and shape must remain consistent.
    Question: Does the blue jay have a black beak?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2

{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The pine branch structure beneath each bird provides ecological context and anchors the scene. Though the branches may be stylized in the shadow box, their basic form — including needle-like foliage and snow-covered limbs — must be retained to maintain visual coherence with the original image.
    Question: Are the birds perched on snow-covered pine branches with visible needles?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2

{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The cardinal’s beak is bright orange-red, a key identifier distinguishing it from other red birds. This color must be preserved even when transformed into a figurine to maintain species accuracy.
    Question: Does the cardinal have an orange-red beak?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The split-frame layout is explicitly mentioned in the editing instruction as a structural element. While the content within each frame changes, the division between the two birds must remain, preserving the original spatial organization.
    Question: Are the cardinal and blue jay positioned in separate vertical sections of the image?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
