### Step 1 - Description of Reference Image and Allowed Changes List:

**Description of Reference Image:**  
The image depicts a serene Japanese village scene with traditional architecture, including multi-tiered pagodas and wooden buildings with tiled roofs. Cherry blossom trees with pink blossoms frame the scene, adding a vibrant touch against the clear blue sky. In the foreground, there is a large straw hat with a red band resting on a stone pedestal. The buildings exhibit classic Japanese design elements, such as wooden beams and paper lanterns. The overall atmosphere is peaceful and culturally rich.

**Thinking Process:**  
The editing instructions specify transforming the buildings into sleek, metallic designs with a futuristic aesthetic. This means the architectural style of the buildings can be altered significantly. However, the cherry blossom trees and traditional features must be preserved. The straw hat in the foreground is not mentioned in the instructions, so its status is unclear but likely should remain unchanged to maintain scene consistency.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
1. The material and design of the buildings can be changed to a sleek, metallic, and futuristic style.
2. The proportions, angles, and details of the buildings can be adjusted to fit the new aesthetic.
3. The color scheme of the buildings can be modernized to align with the futuristic theme.

### Step 2 - Determination of Elements That Should Remain Unchanged:

**Thinking Process:**  
Core recognition elements include the cherry blossom trees, the traditional Japanese architectural outlines (even if the material changes), and the straw hat. Functional/logical association elements include the positioning of the hat and the overall scene layout. Remaining elements like the blue sky and scattered petals should also be retained for visual coherence.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
1. Cherry blossom trees with pink blossoms.
2. Traditional Japanese architectural outlines.
3. Straw hat with a red band.
4. Positioning of the hat on the stone pedestal.
5. Blue sky and scattered petals.
