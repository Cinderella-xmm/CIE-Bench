      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "The face is the primary identifier of the subject, especially in a portrait-style composition. The specific shape of the eyes, the bridge and tip of the nose, the fullness of the lips, and the overall symmetry of the facial features are unique to this figure. Losing these would result in a different person or entity entirely. This is a core identity feature, making it critical to retain even after transformation into a mosaic style.",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the original facial features including the eye shape, nose contour, lip fullness, and symmetrical jawline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The white hair is a distinctive trait that contrasts sharply with the golden armor and wings. Its length, flow, and placement around the shoulders and back are consistent in the original image. While color might subtly shift in a mosaic style, the presence and volume of the white hair are essential for maintaining the figure’s identity. It is a key visual signature.",
      "question": "Is the white hair still present, flowing down past the shoulders, and positioned naturally around the head and neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The crown is an iconic accessory with a distinct angular design and a central gemstone. Its placement atop the head and its ornate structure are integral to the figure’s regal and divine appearance. Any deviation in shape or gem position would alter the symbolic meaning and recognition of the character.",
      "question": "Is the crown still present with its original angular, symmetrical design and central gemstone at the apex?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The wings’ silhouette—large, symmetrical, and extended outward from the shoulders—is crucial for identifying the figure as an archangel. Even if stylized into mosaic form, the wing span, curvature, and attachment points must remain consistent with the original to preserve the sense of grandeur and balance.",
      "question": "Are the wings still symmetrically extended from the shoulders with the same broad, upward-curving shape and full span?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The frontal upright posture defines the figure’s presence and confidence. The arms are at the sides, and the body is aligned vertically, creating a balanced and authoritative stance. Changing this would distort the figure’s intent and narrative role. It is a functional pose that must be preserved.",
      "question": "Is the figure still standing upright with arms at the sides and facing directly forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The skin tone and facial expression contribute to the figure’s emotional and racial identity. The warm undertone of the skin and the neutral yet confident expression are part of her character. While lighting may change, the base tone and expression should remain recognizable.",
      "question": "Is the original skin tone preserved, and does the facial expression remain neutral with a slight hint of serenity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The body proportions—specifically the torso-to-limb ratio and breast shape—are consistent with the original design. These are important for maintaining the figure’s aesthetic and anatomical coherence. Even in mosaic form, the underlying form must align with the original.",
      "question": "Are the body proportions, including the torso width, arm length, and breast shape, consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
