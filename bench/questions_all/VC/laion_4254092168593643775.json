      "thinking_process": "The number \"7\" is a core identity marker of the rider and motorcycle, appearing prominently on both the front fender and side panel. Its presence is essential for identifying the specific rider and maintaining continuity with the original image. If lost or altered, the subject becomes unrecognizable in terms of competitive identity. Thus, it is a 3-point key element.",
      "question": "Is the number \"7\" clearly visible on both the front fender and side panel of the motorcycle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The track outline with \"5/5\" is a functional element indicating race completion. It is already present in the original image and is explicitly referenced in the instruction to be overlaid in bright colors. Retaining its shape and label ensures continuity in the narrative of the race. Loss would break the contextual link to the event.",
      "question": "Is the track outline labeled \"5/5\" present in the upper-right corner of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The dust trail behind the rear wheel is a critical indicator of motion and physical interaction with the terrain. Its origin point at the rear tire and direction of dispersion are essential for conveying speed and realism. Even if stylized into streaks, its source and trajectory must remain consistent.",
      "question": "Does the dust trail originate directly from the rear wheel of the motorcycle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The rider’s posture—leaning forward with hands on handlebars—is fundamental to depicting active motocross riding. Even in minimalist silhouette form, the body angle and hand position must reflect engagement with the bike. Altering this would misrepresent the action.",
      "question": "Is the rider depicted in a forward-leaning posture with hands gripping the handlebars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The front wheel’s circular shape and blue rim are distinctive visual features contributing to the motorcycle’s identity. While colors may be adjusted, the shape and placement must remain to preserve the vehicle’s structure. Losing this detail would distort the mechanical integrity of the bike.",
      "question": "Is the front wheel circular with a blue rim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The spatial arrangement—rider in foreground, desert background, track overlay in upper-right—establishes scene logic. Disrupting this layout could confuse the viewer about the setting and context. While background can be abstracted, the relative positions must be preserved.",
      "question": "Is the rider positioned in the foreground with the desert landscape behind them and the track outline in the upper-right corner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
