      "thinking_process": "The presence of a central river flowing from the foreground to the background is a core compositional element that defines the scene’s depth and focus. Even in an Art Deco style, the river must remain centrally located and extend toward the mountains to preserve the original visual narrative. Its absence or relocation would fundamentally alter the scene’s identity.",
      "question": "Is there a river running down the center of the image from the foreground to the distant mountains?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The two prominent mountain peaks on the left and right sides of the background are iconic landmarks that define the landscape’s identity. Their relative positions and height are critical for recognition. Even if stylized, they must remain as dominant structures in the background to maintain the scene’s core structure.",
      "question": "Are there two large mountain peaks visible in the background, one on the left and one on the right side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The sun near the horizon center is a key light source and compositional anchor. Its position determines the direction of light and the time of day (sunrise/sunset). Even in stylized form, its placement must remain near the center of the horizon to preserve the original atmospheric effect.",
      "question": "Is there a bright circular light source positioned near the center of the horizon line in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The trees on both banks of the river are essential for establishing the autumn setting. While their forms can be simplified, their presence on both sides of the river is necessary to maintain the natural corridor effect. Their absence would break the environmental continuity.",
      "question": "Are there trees present on both sides of the river, extending along the banks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The rocks in the river are minor but identifiable features that add texture and realism to the water. They are visually distinct and help ground the scene. Even in a stylized version, their presence in the river is expected to maintain consistency with the original.",
      "question": "Are there visible rock formations or landmasses within the river, breaking the water surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The reflection in the river is a key visual element that enhances symmetry and depth. While the instruction allows stylization, the concept of reflection must be preserved—especially the mirrored symmetry of trees and sky. Without this, the image loses its reflective quality and compositional balance.",
      "question": "Does the river reflect the trees and sky above it, maintaining a mirrored image across the water surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The autumnal color palette—dominated by reds, oranges, yellows, and greens—is a defining characteristic of the season and the mood of the scene. Even in Art Deco style, these warm tones must be preserved in solid blocks to maintain the seasonal identity.",
      "question": "Are the trees on the riverbanks colored in warm autumn tones such as red, orange, and yellow, with dark green conifers interspersed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
