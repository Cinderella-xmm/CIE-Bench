Description of reference image: The subject is a zebra grazing in a grassy field. The zebra has a distinct black-and-white striped pattern covering its body, including its neck and legs. Its mane is upright and stands along the back of its neck with alternating dark and light stripes. The zebraâ€™s ears are pointed, with visible inner and outer fur details. The surrounding scene is an open field covered with green grass interspersed with small patches of earth and sparse vegetation.

### Step 1 - Allowed Changes List:

**Specific element 1 that allows for changes**  
Extend the zebra's stripes outward to blend with the grass, forming a surreal black-and-white striped grassland carpet.

**Specific element 2 that allows for changes**  
Adjust the proportions of the zebra stripes to merge them seamlessly with the grass while maintaining a surrealistic style.

### Step 2 - Preservation Targets List:

#### Thinking process:
- **Core Recognition Elements:** The zebra's iconic black-and-white stripes are key to recognizing it as a zebra. These stripes serve as the primary identifier and their distinctive contrast should be retained even if the stripes extend into the environment.
- **Functional/Logical Association Elements:** The zebra's posture (grazing) is a functional action indicating its behavior in a natural setting. The continuity of this posture should remain intact for logical consistency.
- **Remaining Elements:** Details like the zebra's mane, ears, and overall body shape are subtle but essential for maintaining visual coherence. The green grass provides environmental context and should remain recognizable.

#### Preservation Targets List:
- The zebra's black-and-white striped pattern (core identity)
- The upright mane and its striped detailing (secondary details)
- Pointed ear shapes and their positioning (secondary details)
- The zebra's grazing posture (functional association)
- The green grass environment (scene context)
