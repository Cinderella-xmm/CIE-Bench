      "thinking_process": "The glowing jack-o'-lantern face is the central identifier of the scarecrow’s Halloween theme. Its presence and specific features—orange glowing eyes and jagged mouth—are essential for recognition. If these are removed or altered (e.g., replaced with a non-glowing mask), the figure loses its core identity. Therefore, preserving the glowing pumpkin face is critical.",
      "question": "Is the pumpkin face with glowing orange eyes and a jagged grin present on the scarecrow?",

      "thinking_process": "The conical straw hat with a wide brim is a distinctive feature of traditional scarecrows and is explicitly referenced in the instructions as being repurposed into a candle holder. Its shape must be preserved even if materials change, as it defines the character’s appearance. Without it, the figure would not resemble the original scarecrow.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The upright stance with outstretched arms and claw-like feet defines the scarecrow’s silhouette and posture. This pose is iconic and essential for identifying the figure as a scarecrow in a field. Altering this would fundamentally change the character’s form and disrupt scene logic.",
      "question": "Is the scarecrow standing upright with arms extended outward and legs ending in claw-like feet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The blue cloth shirt tied around the torso is a unique detail that distinguishes this scarecrow from others. It adds visual contrast and realism. While materials may change, the shape and position of this garment must remain to preserve the original design’s integrity.",
      "question": "Is there a blue cloth shirt tied around the scarecrow’s torso?",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The nighttime farm scene with a moonlit sky, distant mountains, and harvested field is explicitly required in the packaging design. These background elements provide context and atmosphere. Their absence would break the thematic consistency and undermine the “spooky nighttime farm” requirement.",
      "question": "Is the background scene featuring a moonlit sky, distant mountains, and a harvested wheat field present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The bird in flight above and to the left of the scarecrow is a dynamic element contributing to the scene’s life and movement. It is part of the original composition and likely intended to be preserved in the box art. Its removal would reduce visual completeness.",
      "question": "Is there a bird flying above and to the left of the scarecrow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The glow emanating from the pumpkin face is crucial for conveying the Halloween atmosphere and distinguishing the scarecrow from a regular one. It signifies the internal light source, making it a key visual cue. Losing this glow would diminish the spooky effect and alter the mood.",
      "question": "Does the pumpkin face emit a visible glow from within?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
