Description of reference image: The subject is a small white dog with sharp, upright ears, running towards the camera on a grassy field. Its mouth is open in an excited expression, revealing its teeth and tongue. The dog has a red collar around its neck. A bright yellow tennis ball is positioned near its head, seemingly mid-air during play. The background consists of blurred trees and an open green space, indicating a natural outdoor park setting.

### Step 1 - Allowed Changes List:

Specific element 1 that allows for changes:
- Replacing the yellow tennis ball with a flying disc.
- Adding a blue bow tie collar to the dog.

### Step 2 - Preservation Targets List:

Thinking process:
- **Core recognition elements:** The white fur color, upright ears, and open-mouth expression of the dog are critical for its identity. The dog's active posture and direction towards the camera also contribute significantly to maintaining the overall composition.
- **Functional/logical association elements:** The presence of the red collar is associated with the dog and shouldn't be removed. The action of the dog chasing an object must still be logically represented even though the object changes.
- **Non-modified elements based on visual coherence:** The outdoor green setting, grass ground, and the dogâ€™s position relative to the camera should be maintained for visual consistency.

Preservation Targets List:
- White fur color and upright ears of the dog (core recognition)
- Open mouth and teeth expression (functional expression of excitement)
- Red collar (accessory detail)
- Dog's forward motion toward the camera (scene logic)
- Grass ground and blurred tree background (scene coherence)
