**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a stack of chocolate whoopie pies arranged on a white square plate with vertical ridges. Each whoopie pie consists of two dark brown, soft-looking chocolate cake-like halves sandwiching a thick layer of white cream filling. The cakes have slightly cracked surfaces, indicating a moist texture. The pile is composed of at least six whoopie pies stacked in a pyramid-like formation, with the topmost one slightly tilted forward. The plate rests on a wooden surface, partially visible beneath it, and a maroon cloth is seen to the left edge. The background is a solid muted green wall, providing contrast to the rich brown tones of the cookies. The lighting is even and natural, highlighting the glossy texture of the chocolate and the smoothness of the cream.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction specifies transforming the whoopie pies into **cartoon characters** with expressive faces, using their chocolate tops as heads and creamy centers as bodies. This indicates that the **form and structure of the whoopie pies will be altered**, including adding cartoon features such as eyes, mouths, limbs, etc., while retaining their original **chocolate and white cream components** as core materials for character design.  

The instruction also states:  
- "Retain their chocolate tops and creamy centers for heads and bodies" → implies **material identity (color and shape)** must remain recognizable but reinterpreted as character anatomy.  
- "Place them in a playful kitchen setting" → **scene change allowed**; original background and table setup can be replaced.  
- "Panel 1: two pies sit on the edge of the plate, peering over curiously" → **position and posture of some pies are preserved**, but now animated.  
- "Panel 2: one pie leads with a spatula as a sword" → introduces new objects (spatula), so **new props are permitted**.  
- Style: "Bold, thick outlines and vibrant flat colors" → visual style changes allowed, including color saturation and line art.  
- "Handwritten font for text bubbles" → typography is new and not part of original image.

Thus, **allowed changes include**:  
- Characterization (adding facial expressions, limbs)  
- Scene replacement (kitchen setting instead of plain green wall)  
- Addition of props (spatula)  
- Use of bold outlines and flat colors  
- New text elements  
- Reorganization of position/posture within panels  

However, **retention of original material identity** is explicitly required:  
- Chocolate tops → used as heads  
- Creamy centers → used as bodies  
→ So **the core appearance of each whoopie pie as a chocolate cookie with white filling must still be visually identifiable**, even if stylized.

Also, **"two pies sit on the edge of the plate"** suggests that **some positioning relative to the plate is retained**, though the plate itself may be reimagined.

Therefore, **the plate’s presence and function as a base** is implied to be retained in form or concept, even if stylized.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
- Form of whoopie pies (transformed into cartoon characters)  
- Background environment (replaced with kitchen setting)  
- Presence of props (e.g., spatula)  
- Color palette (vibrant flat colors allowed)  
- Line art style (bold outlines)  
- Text bubbles and dialogue  
- Spatial arrangement across comic panels  
- Lighting and mood (playful/adventurous)  
- Texture details (original cracked surface may be simplified or lost)  
- Number of visible pies (may vary by panel)  
- Plate design (can be stylized, but likely retained as base)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
We now identify what **must remain unchanged** based on exclusion from the "Allowed Changes List" and analysis of core identity and logical coherence.

**Core recognition elements:**  
- The **chocolate color and round shape** of the outer layers are essential to identifying the object as a whoopie pie. Even when cartoonified, they must retain these characteristics.  
- The **white cream filling** between the two layers is a defining feature of the whoopie pie—its absence would make the object unrecognizable.  
- The **sandwich structure** (two cakes + filling) is critical to the identity of the snack. If this is lost, the character loses its origin.

**Functional/logical association elements:**  
- The **plate** serves as a functional base. While the scene changes, the instruction says “sit on the edge of the plate,” so the **plate's role as a support structure** must be preserved. Its exact shape or texture may be modified, but its **presence and function** should remain.  
- The **relative position of two pies on the edge** is specified in Panel 1, so this spatial relationship is important for narrative consistency and should be preserved in layout.

**Non-modified element deduction:**  
- The **texture of the chocolate top (cracks)** is a minor detail but contributes to realism and identification. While the instruction allows stylistic simplification, it is not explicitly stated to remove it, so it should be considered a secondary retention point.  
- The **color contrast** between dark chocolate and white cream is key to recognition. Although the instruction allows "vibrant flat colors," it specifies retaining the **chocolate tops and creamy centers**, meaning the **color pairing must be preserved**.

Even though the style changes, the **core identity** of the object depends on:
- Two-part structure
- Chocolate exterior
- White interior filling
- Round shape

These cannot be removed without losing the essence of the whoopie pie.

---

**Preservation Targets List:**  
- The presence of two dark brown chocolate-like halves per whoopie pie  
- The presence of a white cream filling between the two halves  
- The round, sandwich-like shape of each whoopie pie  
- The use of the white plate as a base for the pies  
- The positioning of at least two pies on the edge of the plate (as per Panel 1)  
- The color contrast between dark chocolate and white cream  
- The overall composition of multiple whoopie pies stacked together (implied by the pile)

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The dark brown color of the chocolate cake layers is the primary identifier of the whoopie pie. Without this color, the object would not be recognizable as a chocolate-based dessert. Even in cartoon form, the character’s head/body must retain this hue to maintain identity. Therefore, preserving the dark brown color of the outer layers is a core recognition feature, making it a 3-point question.
    Question: Does each whoopie pie character retain a dark brown chocolate-colored outer layer?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The white cream filling is a defining structural and visual component of the whoopie pie. It separates the two chocolate layers and provides contrast. Removing or altering it would fundamentally change the object's identity. The instruction specifies using the "creamy center" as part of the character’s body, so its presence is essential. Thus, this is a core identity feature with high weight.
    Question: Is there a visible white cream filling between the two chocolate halves of each whoopie pie character?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The sandwich structure—two rounded cake layers enclosing a filling—is unique to whoopie pies. Changing this to a single layer or removing the filling would destroy the object’s identity. The instruction explicitly uses this structure for character design ("chocolate tops and creamy centers for heads and bodies"), confirming its necessity. Hence, the layered structure must be preserved.
    Question: Does each whoopie pie character maintain a two-layered structure with an inner filling?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The white plate serves as a functional base and is referenced in the narrative (“sit on the edge of the plate”). While its appearance may be stylized, its presence is required for continuity in Panel 1. Removing it would break the scene logic and contradict the instruction. Therefore, the plate must remain as a base element.
    Question: Is there a white plate present beneath the whoopie pie characters?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The instruction specifies that two pies are positioned on the edge of the plate in Panel 1. This spatial relationship is critical to the narrative and visual storytelling. Even if stylized, the relative placement of two pies at the edge must be preserved to maintain consistency with the original composition and intended scene.
    Question: Are at least two whoopie pie characters positioned on the edge of the plate?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The round shape of the whoopie pies is fundamental to their identity. Any significant deviation (e.g., square or irregular shapes) would make them unrecognizable. The instruction retains the use of the "tops" and "centers" as parts of characters, implying the original shape is maintained. Thus, circular form is a core visual trait.
    Question: Are all whoopie pie characters circular in shape?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The contrast between the dark chocolate and white cream is a key visual cue for recognition. While the instruction allows "vibrant flat colors," it specifies retaining the chocolate and creamy centers, meaning the color pairing must be preserved. Altering this would reduce clarity and recognition.
    Question: Is there a clear contrast between the dark brown outer layers and the white inner filling of each whoopie pie character?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}
{
    Q8: 
    Thinking process: The cracked surface texture of the chocolate top adds realism and identifies the baked nature of the cake. While the instruction allows stylistic simplification, it does not require its removal. As a minor detail contributing to authenticity, its retention helps preserve the original appearance, though loss would not prevent recognition.
    Question: Do the chocolate tops of the whoopie pie characters show signs of surface cracking or texture?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
