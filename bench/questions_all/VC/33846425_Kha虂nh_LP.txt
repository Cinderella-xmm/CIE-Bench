Description of reference image: The subject is a woman with long black hair, wearing sunglasses perched on her head, seated on the hood of a bright yellow vintage-style vehicle. She wears a white lace dress with a V-neckline and delicate floral embroidery, layered under a light blue open shirt with rolled-up sleeves. Her feet are adorned with beige sandals featuring white flower embellishments. A woven two-tone tote bag (beige and natural brown) rests beside her on the car’s hood. The vehicle has a retro design with round headlights, a mesh grille, and a visible license plate reading "86A 252.63". The background features a clear blue sky above a calm ocean, with a guardrail and beach area visible in the lower-left corner. The lighting is bright and natural, suggesting midday sunlight.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions to determine what can be changed. The instruction specifies:  
- "Transform the scene into a personalized art postcard" → implies overall style/artistic treatment may change, but core subjects may remain.  
- "depict the woman with an enlarged skirt and lace detailing enhanced" → allows modification of the **skirt size** and **lace detail**, meaning these are explicitly permitted to change.  
- "Convert the car into a vintage camper van with floral paintings" → this changes the **vehicle type** and **appearance**, so the original car form (including shape, color, grill, lights, etc.) can be altered.  
- "Place on textured kraft paper with nautical-themed borders" → this changes the **presentation context**, indicating that the entire composition will be framed or mounted differently, but does not require retention of background elements like the ocean or sky unless specified.  

Therefore, allowed changes include:  
- Skirt size and lace detail (explicitly mentioned for enhancement)  
- Car model and design (to become a camper van with floral paint)  
- Background presentation (kraft paper + nautical border)  
- Artistic style (postcard aesthetic)  

However, **no instruction says to remove or alter the woman's identity**, her **facial features**, **hairstyle**, **sunglasses position**, **clothing base layer (white lace dress)**, **sandals with flowers**, **bag**, **license plate**, **car's front structure (grille, headlights, bumper)**, **position on car**, or **overall pose** unless they are affected by the transformation. Since the car is being transformed, its **original form** is no longer required, but **functional parts** like the license plate and **placement** of the woman must still align logically with the new vehicle if the scene remains coherent.

Allowed Changes List:
- Size and texture of the woman’s skirt (enlarged, enhanced lace)
- Vehicle type and appearance (transformed into a vintage camper van with floral paintings)
- Presentation background (placed on textured kraft paper with nautical borders)
- Overall artistic style (art postcard aesthetic)

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements:  
- The **woman’s face**, especially her **closed eyes**, **long black hair**, and **sunglasses on head** are key identifiers of her identity. These are not mentioned for change and are essential for recognizing the subject. Even if clothing changes, facial features must remain consistent.  
- The **white lace dress** is central to her attire; although the **skirt** is to be enlarged and lace enhanced, the **base material and pattern** (white lace) should remain identifiable—otherwise, it becomes a different garment. Thus, the **white lace fabric** is a core feature, even if modified.  
- The **flower-adorned sandals** are distinctive accessories; their presence and design (white flower on beige sandal) are unique and likely intended to be preserved as part of the character’s look.  
- The **woven tote bag** with its **two-tone design (beige and natural brown)** and **bow-tied handle** is a specific object tied to the scene. Though not explicitly stated to be removed, it is part of the original setup and contributes to visual coherence.  
- The **license plate “86A 252.63”** is a fixed identifier on the vehicle. While the car itself is being transformed, if the license plate is retained, it serves as a continuity anchor. However, since the car is being converted into a camper van, the **plate might be repositioned or replaced**, but if not mentioned, it could be assumed to remain unless visually inconsistent.  
- The **woman’s seated posture**—cross-legged on the hood, hands resting on the car, leaning slightly forward—is a functional pose that supports her positioning. This spatial relationship must be preserved for logical consistency, even if the car changes.  

Functional/logical association elements:  
- The **woman sitting on the car’s hood** is a key spatial relationship. If she were moved inside or off the vehicle, the narrative shifts. The **contact point between her legs and the car’s bumper** and **her hand placement on the hood** are critical for maintaining realism and scene logic.  
- The **tote bag placed next to her** suggests ownership and personal context; removing it would break continuity.  
- The **sandals’ placement**—on the bumper, not on the ground—indicates she is seated high, which depends on the car’s height. This physical relationship must be maintained unless the car’s height changes significantly.  

Non-modified element deduction:  
After excluding allowed changes (skirt size, lace detail, car model, background), the following must remain:  
- Woman’s **face**, **hair**, **sunglasses**, **dress base**, **sandals**, **bag**, **pose**, **license plate**, and **spatial relationships**.  
- Although the car is transformed, the **front grille, headlights, bumper, and overall orientation** may be preserved in form if the camper van retains similar proportions. But since the instruction says “convert,” we assume the **original car’s shape is replaced**, so only **elements not tied to the car’s form** (like the license plate if kept) are relevant.  

Preservation Targets List:  
- Woman’s face (especially closed eyes, hairstyle, sunglasses on head)  
- White lace dress (material and pattern, despite enlargement)  
- Flower-adorned sandals (design and placement)  
- Woven two-tone tote bag (color, shape, bow)  
- Seated posture on car hood (hand placement, leg position)  
- License plate “86A 252.63” (if retained)  
- Spatial relationship between woman and car (sitting on hood, feet on bumper)
