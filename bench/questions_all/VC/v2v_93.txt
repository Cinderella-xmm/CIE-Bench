### Step 1 - Allowed Changes List

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a round thermometer with a metallic rim and a white face. The face displays temperature markings ranging from -2°C to 200°C, with a black needle pointing towards the current temperature. The text "TEMPERATURE" is prominently displayed in the center. The background is plain and neutral, ensuring focus on the thermometer.

**Thinking process:**  
The instructions specify transforming the thermometer into a 3D cartoon style with soft lighting, adding stats, and incorporating design elements like a title banner and nameplate. The background should be replaced with cool, professional tones. The thermometer's core functionality and identity should remain intact.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
1. Convert the thermometer to a 3D cartoon style with soft lighting.  
2. Add stats such as "[Temperature Range +200]" and "[Accuracy +10°C]."  
3. Include a title banner labeled "Precision Thermal Gauge."  
4. Add a nameplate identifying the item's designation.  
5. Surround the card with crisp borders.  
6. Replace the background with cool, professional tones.

### Step 2 - Preservation Targets List

**Thinking process:**  
Core recognition elements include the thermometer's shape, temperature scale, and needle. Functional elements like the temperature markings and needle position must be retained for logical consistency. Remaining elements like the metallic rim and white face contribute to visual coherence.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
1. Thermometer's circular shape and metallic rim.  
2. Temperature scale markings (-2°C to 200°C).  
3. Presence of the needle and its position relative to the scale.  
4. Text "TEMPERATURE" in the center.  
5. White face of the thermometer.

### Step 3 - Question Generation

**Q1:**  
Thinking process: The circular shape and metallic rim are core identity features of the thermometer. Losing these would make it unrecognizable.  
Question: Does the thermometer retain its circular shape and metallic rim?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

**Q2:**  
Thinking process: The temperature scale is crucial for the thermometer's function. Without it, the device loses its purpose.  
Question: Are the temperature scale markings (-2°C to 200°C) clearly visible?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

**Q3:**  
Thinking process: The needle's presence and position are essential for indicating temperature.  
Question: Is the needle present and positioned correctly relative to the temperature scale?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

**Q4:**  
Thinking process: The text "TEMPERATURE" is a key identifier of the device's function.  
Question: Is the text "TEMPERATURE" still visible in the center of the thermometer?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

**Q5:**  
Thinking process: The white face provides contrast and clarity for reading the temperature.  
Question: Does the thermometer retain a white face for clear visibility of the markings?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2
