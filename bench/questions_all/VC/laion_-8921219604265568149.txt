**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a large, historic cathedral with a Baroque architectural style, constructed from light beige stone. The façade features intricate carvings, symmetrical columns, ornate pilasters, and decorative scrollwork. Two tall bell towers flank the central structure: the left tower includes a clock face near the top and small arched openings below; the right tower has two visible bells in open arches. At the center of the façade is a large dark wooden doorway, flanked by two smaller side doors. Above the main entrance is a circular stained-glass window with a floral or star-like design. A cross sits atop the central gable. The sky is clear and bright blue. In front of the cathedral, a paved plaza hosts numerous people walking or standing, dressed in casual modern clothing. Surrounding buildings include colonial-style structures with balconies and wrought-iron railings on the right side. The lighting is bright daylight, casting sharp shadows.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction explicitly transforms the entire scene into a **historical-themed miniature encased in a baroque-style display case**, implying that the physical form of the cathedral and surrounding environment will be scaled down and recontextualized within a new framing device. Key changes include:
- The cathedral's material becomes **warm beige resin** (a change in texture and substance).
- The scene is enclosed in an **ornate baroque display case**, altering the spatial context.
- **Miniature figures** replace real people, now elaborately dressed as historical characters.
- **Miniature lamps** with dim, antique glow are added.
- A **plaque with engraved text** about the cathedral’s name and history is introduced.
- The **background** is replaced with a **painted vignette of a vibrant sky**, replacing the actual sky.

Thus, the following elements are **allowed to change**:

**Allowed Changes List:**
- The material of the cathedral façade (from stone to resin)
- The scale of the entire scene (transformed into a miniature)
- The human figures (replaced with tiny, historically dressed miniatures)
- The lighting conditions (dim, antique glow from lamps instead of natural daylight)
- The surrounding environment (enclosed in a display case)
- The sky background (replaced with a painted vignette)
- The addition of artificial elements: ornate case, plaque, lamps
- The color tone of the scene (shift toward warm, antique aesthetic)

Note: While the overall **structure and layout** of the cathedral may remain similar, its **material and presentation** are explicitly changed. The **presence and arrangement** of key architectural features are not mentioned as being altered—only their medium and context are modified.

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
Despite the transformation into a miniature, certain visual elements must be preserved to maintain the identity of the cathedral and ensure consistency with the original image. These are determined based on:

1. **Core recognition elements**: Features that uniquely identify the cathedral as a specific historical building. These include:
   - The **distinctive Baroque façade** with its sculptural details, columns, and symmetry.
   - The **two bell towers** with their specific configurations: one with a clock, the other with two visible bells.
   - The **central rose window** above the main door.
   - The **cross at the apex** of the roofline.
   - The **three-door configuration** (one large central door, two smaller side doors).

   These are iconic identifiers of the cathedral’s architecture and cannot be altered without losing recognition.

2. **Functional/logical association elements**: The **spatial relationship** between the cathedral and its surroundings must be preserved if the scene is to remain logically coherent. For example:
   - The **position of the bell towers** relative to the central façade.
   - The **placement of the main entrance** directly under the rose window.
   - The **proportional layout** of the façade’s vertical and horizontal divisions.

   Even in miniature form, these relationships must be maintained to preserve structural authenticity.

3. **Non-modified element deduction**: After excluding allowed changes (e.g., material, scale, lighting), the remaining architectural details—such as the **shape of the windows**, **design of the cornices**, **presence of the clock**, and **arrangement of the columns**—must be retained. These are not mentioned in the instructions as being changed and are essential for accurate representation.

Additionally, although the people are replaced with miniatures, their **general positions and movement patterns** in the plaza should be preserved to maintain scene logic. However, since they are explicitly replaced, their appearance is not required to be retained.

Preservation Targets List:
- The **overall architectural form and layout** of the cathedral façade
- The **presence and placement of the two bell towers**
- The **clock face on the left tower**
- The **two visible bells in the right tower**
- The **rose window above the central entrance**
- The **cross at the top of the central gable**
- The **three-door arrangement** (central and two side doors)
- The **symmetrical column layout** and **Baroque decorative motifs** on the façade
- The **relative position of the cathedral to adjacent buildings** (especially the balcony-lined building on the right)
- The **basic shape and orientation** of the plaza

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The presence of the **clock face on the left bell tower** is a unique identifying feature of the cathedral. It is located at a specific height and position, and its existence distinguishes this structure from others with similar towers. If removed or altered, the cathedral would lose a critical point of identification. This is a core recognition element and thus carries high weight.
    Question: Is the clock face present on the upper section of the left bell tower?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The **two visible bells** in the right bell tower are distinctive functional and visual elements. Their presence in open arches is a key detail that confirms the tower's purpose and architectural design. Removing them would alter the tower’s identity and function, making it unrecognizable. This is a core functional and visual feature.
    Question: Are there two bells visible in the arches of the right bell tower?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The **rose window** above the central entrance is a hallmark of Baroque church architecture and a defining feature of this cathedral’s façade. Its intricate design and central placement make it a primary identifier. Altering or removing it would fundamentally change the building’s character and recognition.
    Question: Is there a circular stained-glass window with a floral or star-like pattern centered above the main entrance?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The **cross at the apex of the central gable** is a symbolic and architectural signature of the cathedral. Its position at the very top is consistent across views and is essential for religious and structural identification. Without it, the building loses its spiritual and architectural identity.
    Question: Is there a cross positioned at the highest point of the central roofline?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The **three-door configuration**—one large central door flanked by two smaller ones—is a structural and compositional element that defines the cathedral’s frontal symmetry. Changing the number or position of doors would disrupt the balance and recognizability of the façade. This is a key architectural feature.
    Question: Are there three doors on the façade: one large central door and two smaller side doors?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The **symmetrical arrangement of columns and pilasters** on the façade is a hallmark of Baroque design and contributes to the cathedral’s visual harmony. While minor decorative details may be simplified in the miniature, the fundamental symmetry and column layout must be preserved to maintain architectural accuracy.
    Question: Is the façade symmetrically divided by vertical columns and pilasters?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The **left bell tower has a distinct pinkish dome** with a small cross at its peak. This color and shape are part of the tower’s unique profile and help distinguish it from the right tower. While the material may change to resin, the dome’s shape and color should remain consistent to preserve visual identity.
    Question: Does the left bell tower have a pinkish dome with a cross on top?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q8: 
    Thinking process: The **building on the right side with balconies and wrought-iron railings** provides contextual spatial information and helps anchor the cathedral in its urban setting. Although the scene is miniaturized, the relative position and architectural style of this adjacent building should be preserved to maintain environmental coherence.
    Question: Is there a multi-story building with balconies and wrought-iron railings to the right of the cathedral?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
