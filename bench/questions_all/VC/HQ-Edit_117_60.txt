Description of reference image: The subject is a traditional sailing vessel, likely inspired by historical Mediterranean or Middle Eastern designs, floating on calm water during sunset. The boat has a dark wooden hull with visible planks and structural details, including a covered deck area with open sides and vertical railings. A single tall mast supports two triangular sails—main and jib—made of light-colored fabric, slightly billowing in the breeze. The sails are illuminated by warm golden sunlight from the right side, casting soft shadows and highlights across their surfaces. The ship's bow is pointed and slightly elevated, with a small red flag attached near the stern. The water is exceptionally still, reflecting the boat and the sky with minimal distortion, creating a mirror-like effect that enhances the symmetry. The reflection shows the teal-blue underside of the hull and the deep orange-gold gradient of the sky. In the background, a low mountain range appears on the left, silhouetted against the pastel-hued horizon. The sun is positioned low in the sky, just above the horizon line to the right, emitting a bright white glow that diffuses into the surrounding atmosphere. The overall color palette includes warm oranges, yellows, and soft pinks in the sky, transitioning to cool blues and teals in the water.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions word by word. The instruction states: "Transform the sailboat into a walnut wood sculpture." This implies the **form** of the subject changes from a real vessel to a sculptural object made of walnut wood. It specifies carving the sails from polished walnut with grain patterns and shaping the hull with deeper carvings to mimic original planks. This means the **material**, **texture**, and **craftsmanship style** of the boat are being altered, but not necessarily its **shape**, **structure**, or **proportions**—as those are implied to be preserved in sculptural form. The instruction also says: "Position the sculpture on a sleek, pale beige pedestal for display," indicating the **scene environment** (water, sunset, mountains) is to be replaced entirely. Therefore, the **background elements** such as water, sky, sun, mountains, and reflections are **not required to be retained**. However, the **original shape and structural layout** of the boat must remain consistent because it is being transformed into a sculpture of *that same design*. Any change to key components like the number of sails, mast position, hull shape, or deck structure would alter the identity of the object. Additionally, since the sculpture is meant to mimic the original, **core visual features** such as the pointed bow, the dual-sail configuration, the covered deck, and the flag placement should be preserved in form, even if rendered in wood.

Allowed Changes List:
- Material of the boat: changed from wood/plastic/fabric to walnut wood
- Texture of sails and hull: now carved walnut with visible grain and depth
- Surface finish: polished, smooth walnut instead of fabric sails
- Placement: moved from water to a pale beige pedestal
- Background: replaced entirely; no longer includes water, sunset, mountains, or reflections
- Reflections in water: removed due to new setting
- Lighting: may shift based on new display context

Step 2 – Determine the elements that should remain unchanged  
Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements: The sailboat’s identity hinges on its distinctive silhouette and structural features. Key identifiers include the **triangular mainsail and jib**, the **single central mast**, the **pointed bow**, the **covered deck with railing**, and the **position of the flag at the stern**. These define the vessel’s type and historical inspiration. If any of these were removed or altered (e.g., adding a second mast or changing the sail shape), the boat would no longer be recognizable as the original model. Thus, despite material transformation, these **forms must be preserved**.

Functional/logical association elements: The relationship between the mast and sails is functional—each sail must be properly attached and oriented relative to the mast. Changing this would break the logical integrity of the vessel’s design. Also, the **flag’s location** at the stern is a fixed feature tied to maritime tradition and visual identity. Moving it would disrupt recognition.

Non-modified element deduction: After excluding allowed changes (material, texture, background), the remaining **structural geometry** of the boat—its outline, proportions, deck layout, and sail arrangement—must be retained. Even though it becomes a sculpture, the **visual blueprint** of the original must persist. Minor details like the exact curvature of the hull or the spacing of deck posts may vary slightly due to artistic interpretation, but they must not deviate enough to distort the core identity.

Preservation Targets List:  
- Shape and position of the main sail and jib  
- Position and structure of the central mast  
- Pointed bow and overall hull silhouette  
- Covered deck with open sides and vertical railings  
- Flag placement at the stern  
- Relative positioning of all components (mast, sails, deck, bow)

    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The presence of two triangular sails—one large mainsail and one smaller jib—is the defining characteristic of this specific sailboat design. Their arrangement and shape are essential for identifying the vessel as a traditional dhow-style boat. If either sail is missing, reshaped into a square or rectangular form, or repositioned incorrectly, the boat loses its iconic silhouette and becomes unrecognizable. This is a core identity feature, hence weight 3.
    Question: Are both the main triangular sail and the smaller jib sail present and correctly positioned on the mast?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The single central mast is structurally critical and visually dominant. Its placement directly behind the deck and extending vertically through the center of the boat defines the balance and function of the vessel. Removing or shifting it would fundamentally alter the boat’s design and make it inconsistent with the original. This is a core structural element, so it must be preserved.
    Question: Is there a single vertical mast located centrally along the length of the boat?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The pointed bow is a key silhouette feature that distinguishes this boat from other types, such as flat-bottomed or rounded-hull vessels. Its sharp, upward curve at the front is part of the boat’s signature profile. Altering or flattening it would change the vessel’s identity. This is a core visual identifier.
    Question: Does the boat have a sharply pointed bow extending forward from the hull?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The covered deck with open sides and vertical railings is a unique architectural detail that identifies the boat as a historically inspired vessel with sheltered seating. This feature adds functional and aesthetic value and helps distinguish it from simpler boats. While the material may change, the form must remain intact. Losing this structure would reduce the boat’s recognizability.
    Question: Is there a covered section with open sides and vertical railings located over the midsection of the hull?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The small red flag at the stern is a distinct accessory that contributes to the boat’s identity and authenticity. Its position at the rear end of the vessel is consistent with maritime tradition. Removing or relocating it would result in a noticeable loss of detail and reduce the fidelity of the representation.
    Question: Is there a small red flag attached to the stern of the boat?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The relative spatial arrangement of the sails, mast, deck, and bow defines the boat’s proportion and balance. For example, the mast must be centered, the sails must extend outward from it, and the deck must sit below the sails. Disrupting this layout—even slightly—would make the sculpture appear distorted or incorrect. This relational consistency is vital for accurate representation.
    Question: Are the sails, mast, deck, and bow aligned in their original spatial configuration, maintaining the correct proportions and orientation?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
