      "thinking_process": "The **red comb** is a core identification feature of a rooster. Its **bright red color**, **serrated shape**, and **position on top of the head** are unmistakable markers. Even if transformed into a fiery or iridescent version, the **presence and location** of this comb must be preserved to maintain the subject’s identity. Losing it would result in a non-rooster creature, undermining recognition. This is a 3-point element due to its role in species identification.",
      "question": "Is the rooster’s comb present on top of its head in a prominent, upright position?",

      "thinking_process": "The **wattles** beneath the beak are another key anatomical feature of roosters. They are **red**, **fleshy**, and located directly below the beak. Their presence confirms the subject as a rooster. Even if stylized, their **location and form** must remain identifiable. Removing them would misrepresent the animal. This is a 3-point element due to its diagnostic value.",

      "thinking_process": "The **beak** is a functional and identifying feature. It is **dark-colored**, **pointed**, and attached to the front of the face. Its shape and position are essential for distinguishing a rooster from other birds. Even if glowing or enhanced, its **basic form and placement** must remain. Altering it significantly could break the link to the original subject. This is a 3-point element.",

      "thinking_process": "The **legs and feet** are crucial for grounding the subject in reality. The rooster stands on two legs with three forward-facing toes and one backward toe. This structure is necessary for balance and movement. Even if runes are added, the **number and arrangement of toes** must remain accurate. Changing this would affect the biological plausibility. This is a 2-point element due to its importance in posture and function.",

      "thinking_process": "The **asphalt surface** with scattered debris (leaves, twigs, moisture spots) provides environmental context. The rooster is standing on it, and this interaction is essential for scene coherence. If the background were replaced or heavily altered, the edited image would lose its original setting. Since no instruction says to change the background, it must be preserved. This is a 2-point element because it defines the scene and anchors the subject.",

This stance is part of the original composition and helps convey the subject’s character. Even if stylized, the **overall orientation and balance** must be maintained. This is a 1-point element as it supports visual consistency but is less critical than anatomy.",

      "thinking_process": "The **tail feathers** are being replaced with smoke-like plumes, but the **original tail structure** must still be referenced in the transformation. The tail is located at the back, curved upward, and composed of layered black feathers. Even if transformed, the **placement and general shape** of the tail must remain consistent with the original. This ensures continuity in the subject’s silhouette. This is a 2-point element due to its role in form and balance.",
