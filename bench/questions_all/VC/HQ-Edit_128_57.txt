**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is an ornate, antique-style wooden writing desk positioned centrally in a grand library. The desk features elaborate carvings, including scrollwork, floral motifs, and a central medallion depicting a lion's head. It has three drawers with brass handles and decorative inlays. On top of the desk lies an open, aged book with yellowed pages filled with dense text, resting on a dark leather surface. A quill pen, held upright by a metallic holder shaped like a bird’s head, leans over the book. To the right of the book is a small glass ink bottle with a silver cap. Behind the desk, a large arched window with leaded glass panes allows soft daylight to filter through sheer white curtains. The left side of the image is dominated by tall, dark wood bookshelves filled with uniformly bound books in leather spines, arranged vertically across multiple shelves. The floor is covered with a richly patterned Persian-style rug in deep reds and blues. The ceiling features intricate gilded moldings and a central crest-like emblem. The overall atmosphere is one of scholarly elegance, with strong contrasts between light and shadow, emphasizing texture and depth.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction explicitly transforms the scene into a **vintage stationery set packaging design**, reimagining key elements:  
- The **desk** becomes a **decorative box base** with embossed wood textures (form changed).  
- The **book** becomes a **writing pad** with antique-style paper (function and form changed).  
- The **quill** becomes a **logo embossed in gold foil** (transformed from object to branding element).  
- A **small ink bottle** is added on top (new element), with **brand details etched along the spine of the book** (modification to existing object).  

These changes indicate that:  
- The **physical forms** of the desk, book, and quill are being transformed—so their original appearances can be altered.  
- The **scene environment** (library) is not required to be preserved—it is implied to be reimagined as part of the packaging design.  
- However, the **core visual identity** of these objects must remain recognizable even after transformation, especially if they serve as symbolic anchors in the new design.  

Allowed Changes List:  
- Form and function of the **desk** (now a box base)  
- Form and content of the **book** (now a writing pad with etched brand details)  
- Transformation of the **quill** into a **gold-foil logo**  
- Addition of an **ink bottle** on top  
- Reinterpretation of the **entire scene** as a packaging design (background and layout may change)  
- Style shift to **embossed textures**, **antique paper**, **gold foil**, etc., indicating material and finish changes

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
Despite the extensive transformation described, certain **visual identifiers** must be retained to preserve the **iconic essence** of the original image and ensure coherence between source and edit. These include:

1. **Core recognition elements**:  
   - The **ornate carving style** of the desk (especially the lion’s head medallion and scrollwork) is a unique identifier of its baroque/rococo aesthetic. Even if reshaped into a box, this decorative language should persist to maintain visual continuity.  
   - The **quill’s feather shape** must remain identifiable—though it becomes a logo, its silhouette must resemble a real quill to retain symbolic meaning.  
   - The **open book format** with visible aged pages must be preserved in form, even if converted into a writing pad; otherwise, the transformation loses narrative logic.  

2. **Functional/logical association elements**:  
   - The **relationship between the quill and the book** (as writing tools) must be maintained—this functional pairing defines the scene’s purpose. If the quill becomes a logo and the book becomes a pad, their spatial and thematic connection must still reflect that relationship.  
   - The **positioning of the ink bottle** relative to the writing instruments suggests usage context—its placement on top of the desk/book area maintains logical consistency.  

3. **Non-modified element deduction**:  
   - Though the background is reimagined, **specific architectural cues** such as the **arched window with leaded glass** and **curved curtain drapes** may be retained for stylistic cohesion or symbolic depth.  
   - The **dark wood tone** of the desk and shelves, **yellowed parchment color** of the book pages, and **rich red/blue rug pattern** contribute to the vintage ambiance and should be preserved in color and texture unless explicitly replaced.  

Preservation Targets List:  
- The **lion’s head medallion** on the front of the desk  
- The **feather shape of the quill** (even if stylized)  
- The **open book with visible aged pages**  
- The **wooden texture and dark finish** of the desk  
- The **overall composition** placing the desk centrally before a window and bookshelves  
- The **color palette** of dark brown, cream, gold, and deep red/blue  
- The **arched window with grid-patterned glass**  
- The **presence of bookshelves filled with leather-bound books**

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The lion’s head medallion is a core decorative feature of the desk, serving as a distinctive iconographic element that identifies the ornate craftsmanship. Its presence and position at the center of the desk’s front panel are essential to maintaining the desk’s identity. Removing or altering its form would result in a loss of the original design’s signature detail, making it unrecognizable as the same piece. Therefore, this is a key identity element with a weight of 3 points.
    Question: Is the lion’s head medallion present at the center of the desk's front panel?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The quill’s feather shape is critical to its identity as a writing instrument. Even when transformed into a logo, the silhouette must retain the curved, tapering form of a real quill to preserve symbolic meaning. Losing this shape would break the connection to the original object and undermine the theme of vintage stationery. Thus, it is a core identification feature with a weight of 3 points.
    Question: Does the quill maintain its feather shape, even if stylized?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The open book with visible aged pages is the central object on the desk and represents the act of writing. Its transformation into a writing pad requires that the form remains open and shows textured, yellowed paper. This ensures continuity in function and visual storytelling. Without this, the edited image fails to convey the intended theme of writing. Hence, it is a key functional element with a weight of 3 points.
    Question: Is the book depicted as open, showing two pages of aged, yellowed paper?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
