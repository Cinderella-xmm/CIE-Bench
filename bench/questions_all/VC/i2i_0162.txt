Description of reference image: The subject is a small mouse in a kitchen setting, positioned centrally in the image. Its fur has a mix of brown, orange, and white, with a distinct white belly and face. The mouse has large, upright ears and long whiskers. Its eyes are wide, giving an alert expression. The background shows a wooden floor and parts of kitchen cabinets and appliances. Scattered around the mouse are crumbs of food.

### Step 1 - Analyze editing instructions and determine allowed changes:

Thinking process: The instructions require converting the image to Pixar-style animation. Therefore, the texture of the mouse's fur, the floor, and other elements can be changed to a cartoon style. The overall scene can shift toward softer lines and shading typical of animated films. However, the mouse's key features, the crumbs, and the setting must still be recognizable.

Allowed Changes List:
1. Texture and visual style of the mouse's fur and skin.
2. Style and texture of the floor and background.
3. Lighting and shadows to align with animation norms.

### Step 2 - Determine elements that should remain unchanged:

Thinking process: 
- **Core recognition elements**: The mouse's brown-orange-white fur pattern, its distinctive whiskers and large ears, as well as the presence of crumbs on the floor are critical for identity.
- **Functional/logical elements**: The mouse's interaction with the crumbs (standing near them and looking downward) maintains the logical context of the scene and thus must stay intact.
- **Non-modified elements**: Details like the relative sizes and positions of the mouse, crumbs, and background elements ensure the image remains coherent.

Preservation Targets List:
1. Mouse's fur color pattern (brown, orange, white)
2. Mouse's whiskers and large ears
3. Presence of food crumbs on the floor
4. Position of the mouse (near crumbs, looking downward)
5. General kitchen setting (floor, cabinets)

### Step 3 - Generate questions for detecting retention of edited elements:

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The mouse's color pattern is a key visual identifier. Losing this would make it hard to recognize the subject as the same mouse.
    Question: Does the mouse retain its brown, orange, and white fur pattern?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The whiskers and ears are crucial for the character's identity. Without them, the mouse loses its distinct look.
    Question: Are the mouse's whiskers and large ears clearly visible?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The crumbs are essential for the context of the scene. Their absence would disconnect the mouse from its environment.
    Question: Are the food crumbs present on the floor near the mouse?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The mouseâ€™s posture and gaze relate logically to the crumbs, ensuring that the scene makes sense.
    Question: Is the mouse positioned near the crumbs and looking downward towards them?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The kitchen setting provides context and consistency in the environment. While the style may change, the setting should remain recognizable.
    Question: Is the general kitchen setting with flooring and cabinets identifiable?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
