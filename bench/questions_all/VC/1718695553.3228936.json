      "thinking_process": "The orange and black tiger stripe pattern is the most distinctive visual feature of the hippo, distinguishing it from a regular plush hippo and giving it thematic identity. The pattern’s specific color scheme (orange with black stripes) and distribution across the body are core to its recognition as a “tiger-stripe hippo.” Any deviation would make the object unrecognizable as the original concept. This is a key identity element.",
      "question": "Is the orange and black tiger stripe pattern present on the hippo’s body, head, and limbs?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The knitted texture is a defining characteristic of the toy, indicating handmade craftsmanship and material quality. The visible stitches and slight irregularities in the fabric surface are essential for identifying it as a knitted item rather than a smooth plastic or fabric toy. Losing this texture would change the perceived nature of the product.",
      "question": "Is the visible knitted texture with distinct stitches present on the hippo’s body and the beach ball?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The light gray coloration of the hippo’s face, belly, and limbs contrasts with the striped areas and is crucial for maintaining the correct species representation (hippo) beneath the costume. Changing this color would misrepresent the animal and disrupt the visual balance of the design.",
      "question": "Are the face, belly, and limbs of the hippo rendered in light gray color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The red, yellow, and white striped pattern of the beach ball is unique and matches the playful, seaside theme. It is not just decorative—it is a key identifier of the ball as a toy designed for beach play. Altering the colors or pattern would change its symbolic meaning and visual role.",
      "question": "Does the beach ball have red, yellow, and white horizontal stripes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The posture of the hippo leaning forward toward the ball conveys action and engagement, essential for storytelling and marketing a playful toy. This dynamic pose establishes the functional relationship between the toy and the ball, which must be preserved even in a studio setting to maintain logical consistency.",
      "question": "Is the hippo positioned leaning forward with its front limbs near the beach ball?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The round shape and proportional size of the beach ball relative to the hippo are important for scale accuracy and realism. A significantly larger or smaller ball would break the visual logic of the scene and affect how the toy is perceived in terms of usability.",
      "question": "Is the beach ball round and approximately the same height as the hippo’s torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The facial features—large dark eyes, small smile, and rounded ears—are key to expressing emotion and appeal, especially for children’s toys. These features contribute to the character’s charm and must be preserved to retain the intended emotional impact.",
      "question": "Does the hippo have large dark eyes, a small curved smile, and small rounded ears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
