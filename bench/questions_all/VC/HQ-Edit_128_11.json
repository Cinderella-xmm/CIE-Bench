      "thinking_process": "The central dome ceiling with its painted fresco and surrounding gilded border is a signature architectural element of the concert hall. It provides the backdrop and defines the opulence of the venue. Even if additional patterns are added, the original fresco and its placement must remain intact to preserve the hall’s identity.",
      "question": "Is the central dome ceiling featuring a painted fresco with floral motifs and a surrounding gilded border still present?",

      "thinking_process": "The chandelier’s central position and basic structure—its multi-tiered crystal form and candle-like lights—are iconic elements that define the hall’s grandeur. While the instruction allows enhancement of ornate detailing, the chandelier’s fundamental shape and location must remain unchanged to maintain continuity with the original scene.",
      "question": "Is the large chandelier suspended from the center of the ceiling, composed of multiple tiers of crystals and candle-like lights?",

      "thinking_process": "The symmetrical arrangement of tiered audience seating is a defining spatial feature of the concert hall. It establishes the scale and context of the performance. Although the audience may be simplified into silhouettes, their layered, curved configuration around the stage must be preserved to maintain the architectural logic and visual balance.",
      "question": "Are the audience seats arranged in multiple curved tiers surrounding the stage in a symmetrical fashion?",
