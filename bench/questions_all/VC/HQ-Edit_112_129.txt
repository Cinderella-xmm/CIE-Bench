Description of reference image: The subject is an ornate, metallic teapot positioned centrally on a rustic wooden table. The teapot has a rounded, bulbous body with a long, curved spout extending to the left and a gracefully scrolled handle on the right. Its surface is intricately engraved with detailed floral patterns, including prominent roses and surrounding leaves, rendered in high relief with fine shading that gives a three-dimensional appearance. The lid is domed and topped with a decorative finial resembling a stylized acorn or flame motif. The base of the teapot features a thin, ridged band with repeating geometric detailing. The material appears to be polished silver or pewter, exhibiting reflective highlights and deep shadows that emphasize its texture and craftsmanship. The background consists of soft, vertical drapes framing a window with a grid of square panes, allowing diffused sunlight to cast diagonal shadows across the wooden surface, creating a warm, natural lighting effect.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions word by word to determine what can be changed. The instruction states: "Transform the ornate teapot into an enchanting miniature scene within a glass dome display." This indicates a complete transformation of the **form** and **context** of the teapot — it is no longer just a standalone object but becomes part of a diorama-like setup. The instruction further specifies:  
- Position the teapot on a vintage wooden base with a soft, velvet lining → changes the **supporting platform**, so original table cannot remain.  
- Add tiny flowering plants and ferns emerging from the spout and lid → introduces new **organic elements** growing from existing parts; these are additions, not replacements.  
- Create delicate butterflies hovering around floral engravings → adds **new dynamic elements** (butterflies), not altering original engraving.  
- Use subtle, earth-toned hues → changes **color palette**, implying tonal shift from monochrome/silver to warmer tones.  

The instruction does **not** say to remove or alter the teapot’s core form, nor does it specify changing the **floral engravings**, **spout**, **handle**, **lid**, or **finial** — only to **enhance** them with additional life. Thus, while the **scene** and **context** are being transformed, the **teapot's structure and design** are implied to remain foundational.

Allowed Changes List:  
- Scene environment (wooden table replaced by glass dome display)  
- Supporting surface (original table replaced by vintage wooden base with velvet lining)  
- Addition of tiny flowering plants and ferns emerging from spout and lid  
- Addition of small butterflies near floral engravings  
- Color scheme shifted to earth-toned hues  
- Introduction of glass dome enclosure  

Step 2 - Determine the elements that should remain unchanged

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements: The teapot’s identity hinges on its **distinctive shape** (bulbous body, curved spout, scrolled handle), **metallic material appearance**, and **intricate floral engravings** — especially the central rose and surrounding botanical motifs. These are unique visual identifiers distinguishing it from other vessels. Even if placed in a dome, the teapot must retain its **basic silhouette**, **engraved floral pattern**, and **structural components** (spout, handle, lid, finial) to maintain identity. Removing or distorting these would make it unrecognizable as the original object.

Functional/logical association elements: The **spout and lid** are functional parts of a teapot; even in a decorative context, their presence and placement must remain logical — plants emerging from them do not negate their structural role. The **handle and spout** must still connect properly to the body, maintaining the teapot’s integrity as a vessel. The **floral engravings** serve both aesthetic and symbolic purposes; they are not just decoration but part of the teapot’s artistic identity. Their positions and forms must remain consistent.

Non-modified element deduction: After excluding allowed changes (scene, support, added flora/fauna, color), the remaining **structural and decorative details** of the teapot itself — such as the **shape of the spout**, **curved scroll of the handle**, **domed lid with finial**, **central rose engraving**, **leaf patterns**, and **base ridge** — must be preserved. These are not mentioned for change and are essential for visual coherence. Although the color may shift, the **presence** and **arrangement** of these elements must remain intact.

Preservation Targets List:  
- The overall shape and proportions of the teapot (bulbous body, curved spout, scrolled handle)  
- The position and form of the spout (left side, curved)  
- The position and form of the handle (right side, ornate scroll)  
- The domed lid with finial at the top  
- The central rose engraving on the body  
- The surrounding floral and leaf patterns  
- The base ridge with geometric detailing  
- The material appearance suggesting polished metal (reflective, metallic sheen)

    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The central rose engraving is the most prominent and identifiable feature of the teapot's decorative design. It is located at the center of the body and is rendered with high detail, including layered petals and shading that give it depth. This specific floral motif is a core identifier of the teapot's artistic style and serves as a focal point. If this rose is removed, altered in shape, or replaced with another flower, the teapot’s distinctive character is lost. Therefore, preserving the exact form and position of the central rose is critical for identity retention, assigning it a weight of 3 points.
    Question: Is the central rose engraving present on the front of the teapot's body, with clearly defined layered petals and shaded depth?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The spout is a defining functional and structural component of the teapot, extending from the left side in a smooth, curved arc. Its shape and orientation are integral to the teapot’s silhouette and usability. Even if plants emerge from it, the spout’s original form must remain recognizable. Altering its curve or removing it would fundamentally change the object’s identity. As a key structural element, its preservation ensures continuity in form and function, warranting a weight of 3 points.
