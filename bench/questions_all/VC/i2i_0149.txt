Description of reference image: The subject is a tabby cat with a white belly, lying on a wooden surface. The cat has a distinctive striped tabby pattern on its face and body, with a mix of black, brown, and orange stripes. Its eyes are vivid green, and its nose and mouth area are white. The cat's tongue is sticking out slightly, adding a playful touch. The background is dark, making the cat stand out prominently. The lighting highlights the fur texture and facial features.

### Step 1 - Allowed Changes List:

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction specifies changing the cat’s head positioning to make it appear as though it extends slightly out of the frame while ensuring the curled tongue has clear spatial depth. This implies the following changes are permitted:

1. **Cat’s head positioning**: The cat’s head can be modified to extend slightly out of the frame.
2. **Tongue depth effect**: Adjustments can be made to the tongue to create a spatial depth effect, making it seem closer to the viewer.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
1. Position of the cat’s head relative to the frame.  
2. Spatial depth and appearance of the curled tongue.
