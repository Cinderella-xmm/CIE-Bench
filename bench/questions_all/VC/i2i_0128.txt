Description of reference image:
The subject is a person typing on a laptop keyboard. The hands are positioned above the keys, with fingers actively pressing them. The laptop screen appears illuminated, suggesting active use. The background is blurred, indicating focus on the hands and the keyboard. The lighting highlights the hands and the keyboard while keeping the rest of the scene subdued.

### Step 1 - Allowed Changes List
Thinking process:
The instructions specify converting the image to a cyberpunk style by changing the keyboard's appearance to emit blue-purple neon light and the fingertips to glow softly. This means the lighting, color tones, and some texture aspects of the keyboard and fingertips can be altered.

Allowed Changes List:
Specific element 1 that allows for changes: The keyboard's light colors (to blue-purple neon).
Specific element 2 that allows for changes: The fingertips' appearance (to make them glow softly).
Specific element 3 that allows for changes: The overall color tone and lighting to match a cyberpunk aesthetic.

### Step 2 - Determination of Elements That Should Remain Unchanged
Thinking process:
Core Recognition Elements: The hands' positioning, the keyboard's layout and function, the interaction between hands and keyboard, and the overall composition should stay consistent for the image to retain its original meaning after editing.

Functional/Logical Association Elements: The hands must maintain their interaction with the keyboard—pressing keys—in a way that is logically coherent with the cyberpunk style transformation.

Non-modified Element Deduction: Details like the visible parts of the laptop's body, the shape and layout of the keys, and the general hand posture should be retained for visual coherence.

Preservation Targets List:
(Element 1 that should be maintained: Hands actively pressing keys)
(Element 2 that should be maintained: Keyboard's physical layout and structure)
(Element 3 that should be maintained: Laptop’s identifiable form and placement)
(Element 4 that should be maintained: General hand posture and interaction)

### Step 3 - Generation of Yes/No Questions

{
Q1: 
Thinking process: The hands actively pressing keys is crucial for recognizing the action taking place. Losing this would fail to depict the intended interaction.
Question: Are the hands still visibly interacting with and pressing the keys on the keyboard?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
Weight: 3
}

{
Q2: 
Thinking process: The physical structure of the keyboard is a key detail for identifying the object. Changing its layout would alter how viewers perceive the image's core subject.
Question: Does the keyboard retain its original physical layout and key structure despite the added neon effects?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
Weight: 2
}

{
Q3: 
Thinking process: The form and placement of the laptop provide context and keep the scene grounded in reality. Altering this could disrupt visual coherence.
Question: Is the laptop's overall body shape and placement relative to the hands consistent with the original image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
Weight: 2
}

{
Q4: 
Thinking process: The general hand posture helps maintain the naturalness of the scene. Any significant change here would make the image appear unnatural or confusing.
Question: Do the hands retain their general posture and positioning relative to the keyboard as seen in the original?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
Weight: 2
}

{
Q5: 
Thinking process: While colors can change, the texture of the keyboard and surface beneath the hands should remain true-to-life to prevent an overly surreal look.
Question: Does the image retain realistic textures for the keyboard and the surface under the hands?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
Weight: 1
