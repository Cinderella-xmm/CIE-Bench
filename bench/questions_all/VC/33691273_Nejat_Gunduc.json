      "thinking_process": "The Coca-Cola bottle is a globally recognized product with a unique contour and label design. Its presence is essential for brand identification and the original juxtaposition. Even in a surreal comic strip, the silhouette and partial logo must be preserved to maintain the reference to Coca-Cola. Losing this would destroy the core commercial and thematic anchor of the image, making it unrecognizable in context. Therefore, this is a 3-point element.",
      "question": "Is the Coca-Cola bottle present in the advertisement with its distinctive curved shape and visible partial logo?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The white earbud and its wire are central to the narrative of mimicry. The man imitates the woman by holding an earbud, which visually links them. If the earbud is absent or replaced, the core concept of imitation collapses. The wire must extend from the woman’s ear to suggest connectivity, which is a key visual cue. This is a functional and symbolic element critical to the image’s meaning, hence a 3-point question.",
      "question": "Is the white earbud visible in the woman’s ear with the wire extending downward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The profile view of both figures is fundamental to the composition. The man and woman face the same direction, creating symmetry and enabling direct visual comparison. Altering this orientation would disrupt the intended juxtaposition and weaken the narrative. This is a core compositional element, not just a detail, so it deserves high weight.",
      "question": "Are both the man and the woman shown in profile, facing to the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The man’s hand gesture — bringing the earbud to his ear — is the physical manifestation of the imitation. It is the action that ties the real person to the advertised image. Even if transformed into a detective, this gesture must be preserved to maintain the original narrative logic. Removing or altering it would break the connection between the two figures.",
      "question": "Is the man’s right hand positioned near his ear, holding the earbud in a manner that mimics the woman’s use?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The torn edge of the poster is a specific texture that grounds the image in reality and suggests urban decay. It differentiates the ad from a clean digital rendering and adds authenticity. While the background may be changed, this detail should remain to preserve the original context and texture. It is a secondary but important detail that affects visual consistency.",
      "question": "Is the top-right corner of the advertisement visibly torn or peeling, revealing the underlying surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The spatial arrangement — the man standing in front of the ad — is essential to the visual narrative. It establishes the relationship between the real world and the advertisement. If the man were moved behind the ad or placed elsewhere, the concept of imitation would be lost. This is a logical and spatial requirement, so it is a 2-point element.",
      "question": "Is the man positioned in front of the advertisement, partially overlapping it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The visible portion of the Coca-Cola logo on the bottle is a key identifier. Even if stylized, the script-like font and curvature of the letters must remain recognizable. Losing this would make the brand unidentifiable, undermining the satirical or nostalgic intent of the edit. This is a core brand element, hence high weight.",
      "question": "Is the word \"Coca\" or \"Coca-Cola\" legible on the bottle in the advertisement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
