**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a large, dark-furred gorilla positioned centrally in the frame, facing forward with a direct, intense gaze. The gorilla has a prominent silverback crest on its head, thick black fur with subtle highlights indicating texture and depth, and deep-set golden-yellow eyes that convey alertness. Its facial features are highly detailed, including pronounced brow ridges, a broad nose, and a firm mouth. The gorilla is holding a large bunch of ripe yellow bananas in both hands, cradled in front of its chest. The bananas are curved, clustered together at the stem end, and show natural blemishes and slight bruising, indicating ripeness. The background is a dense, misty jungle environment with hanging vines, ferns, and soft diffused light filtering through the canopy, creating a hazy green-yellow atmosphere. The lighting emphasizes the gorilla’s form with gentle illumination from above, enhancing its three-dimensional appearance.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction specifies transforming the image into a **cereal box design**, using the **gorilla holding bananas as the central artwork**. This indicates that the **core visual composition**—the gorilla and the bananas—is to be preserved and repurposed as the main illustration. The instruction allows for significant changes to the surrounding context (e.g., adding packaging elements), but explicitly states that the **central artwork remains the gorilla holding bananas**. Therefore, the **subject’s identity and key pose must remain intact**.

Key phrases:
- "Create a cereal box design" → **scene/environment can be changed**
- "featuring the gorilla holding bananas as the central artwork" → **the gorilla and bananas must remain the central visual focus**
- "Use vibrant greens and yellows..." → **color palette can be adjusted**, but not necessarily the original colors
- "Include a playful jungle illustration on the back..." → **backside content is new**, so it does not affect the front
- No mention of altering the gorilla’s face, posture, or banana details → **these should be retained**

Allowed Changes List:
- Background scene (jungle replaced by cereal box design)
- Color scheme (vibrant greens and yellows may override original tones)
- Addition of text ("Jungle Crunch", fun facts)
- Addition of decorative elements (banana motifs, leafy accents)
- Layout structure (transition to rectangular box format)
- Perspective/angle (if needed to fit box layout)
- Lighting (adjusted to match product packaging aesthetics)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
Core recognition elements: The **gorilla's facial features**, especially the **golden-yellow eyes**, **brow ridge shape**, **silverback crest**, and **dark fur texture**, are essential for identifying the animal as a realistic, iconic silverback gorilla. These features distinguish it from other primates and are critical for maintaining the subject’s identity. The **banana bunch** is also a core element—it is being held in a specific way, forming a distinct arc, and is central to the narrative of the image. Changing its number, shape, or position would alter the intended message.

Functional/logical association elements: The **act of holding the bananas** is central to the image’s meaning. The gorilla’s hands must maintain their grip on the bunch, preserving the functional relationship between the subject and the object. Removing or repositioning this interaction would break the logical coherence of the original scene.

Non-modified element deduction: While the background can change, the **subject’s posture**, **facial expression**, **fur texture**, and **banana details** are not mentioned as changeable. Since they are part of the central artwork, they must be preserved. Even if colors shift due to new packaging design, the **presence**, **shape**, and **relative positioning** of these elements must remain consistent.

Preservation Targets List:
- The gorilla’s face, including golden-yellow eyes, brow ridges, and facial structure
- The silverback crest on the head
- The dark, textured fur with visible hair strands and volume
- The bananas held in both hands, forming a cluster with visible stems and blemishes
- The overall frontal pose of the gorilla looking directly at the viewer
- The hand positions gripping the banana bunch

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The golden-yellow eyes are a defining feature of the gorilla’s expression and contribute significantly to its identity and emotional impact. In real-world gorillas, eye color and placement are key identifiers, and in this image, the contrast between the dark fur and bright eyes makes them visually dominant. If the eyes were altered in color or removed, the subject would no longer resemble the original, making this a core identity element.
    Question: Are the gorilla’s eyes golden-yellow in color?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The silverback crest is an iconic physical trait of adult male gorillas, distinguishing them from females and juveniles. Its presence confirms the subject’s species and maturity. Removing or altering this crest would misrepresent the animal, making it unrecognizable as a silverback. Thus, it is a core identification feature.
    Question: Is there a prominent silver-colored crest on the top of the gorilla’s head?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The bananas are central to the image’s theme and narrative. Their curved shape, clustered arrangement, and visible stem are essential to recognizing them as a single bunch. Altering their form or replacing them would violate the instruction to use “the gorilla holding bananas” as central artwork. The specific grouping and curvature are unique visual identifiers.
    Question: Is the banana bunch composed of multiple yellow bananas curving outward from a common stem?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The gorilla’s hands are visibly gripping the banana bunch, which establishes the functional interaction between subject and object. This gesture is necessary to convey the action described in the original image. If the hands were detached or not holding the bananas, the core action would be lost, disrupting the intended narrative.
    Question: Are both of the gorilla’s hands actively holding the banana bunch?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The dark, textured fur with visible individual strands and shading provides realism and distinguishes this gorilla from stylized or cartoon versions. The texture contributes to the lifelike quality and helps identify the species. Losing this detail would make the image appear flat or artificial, compromising its authenticity.
    Question: Does the gorilla have thick, dark fur with visible texture and depth?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The frontal pose with direct eye contact creates a powerful connection with the viewer and is a key compositional choice in the original image. This orientation is essential for maintaining the dramatic impact and ensuring the subject remains the focal point. Changing the angle or turning the head would alter the emotional tone and visual balance.
    Question: Is the gorilla facing directly forward, making eye contact with the viewer?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The bananas show natural imperfections such as brown spots and minor bruises, which add realism and indicate ripeness. These details are present in the original and help distinguish them from idealized or cartoonish representations. Removing them would reduce authenticity and potentially mislead viewers about the fruit’s condition.
    Question: Do the bananas have visible brown spots and slight blemishes?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
