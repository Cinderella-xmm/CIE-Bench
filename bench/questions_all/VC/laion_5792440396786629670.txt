**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a structured site architecture plan presented as a hierarchical flowchart. At the top center is a rounded rectangle labeled "HOMEPAGE *Includes Mission Statement" in black text on a white background. Directly beneath it, five primary navigation sections branch out horizontally: "PRODUCTS & SOLUTIONS," "ABOUT US," "EVENTS & RESOURCES," "SUCCESS STORIES," and "CONTACT US." These are orange rounded rectangles indicating 1st-level pages. Each of these branches into secondary (dark gray), tertiary (blue), and quaternary (red) level nodes, connected by clean white lines. Specific labels include "Products," "Our Team," "News," "Case Study #1," etc., with clear textual content. The footer section includes "Privacy Policy" and "Site Map" under a "FOOTER" label. On the right side, a "SITE MAP KEY" legend uses color-coded squares to define levels: white for Homepage, orange for 1st Level, dark gray for 2nd Level, blue for 3rd Level, red for 4th Level, and cyan for Future. The logo "to the web" appears in the top-left corner with a yellow circle and blue text. The overall layout is clean, professional, and organized on a white background.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction specifies transforming this sterile site map into a **playful children's treasure map**, using a **whimsical visual style**. It explicitly states:
- Replace page names with **fun icons** (e.g., castle for Homepage)
- Change path lines to **winding journey trails**
- Add **imaginative decorative elements** such as **colorful trees and mystical creatures**
- Use **bold, child-friendly colors** and **storybook-style fonts**

This indicates that:
- The **structure** of the hierarchy (i.e., the logical relationships between pages) must be preserved — but not necessarily the visual form.
- The **content labels** (like "Products," "About Us") can be replaced with icons.
- The **lines connecting nodes** can be transformed into winding paths.
- **Decorative elements** (trees, creatures) may be added freely.
- **Colors and fonts** can be changed significantly.
- **Icons** will replace text labels.
- The **layout hierarchy** (what connects to what) must remain logically consistent.

However, the instruction does **not** say to change or remove:
- The **logical structure** of the site map (i.e., which pages are under which)
- The **functional purpose** of each node (e.g., Products → Product #1 → Product Details)
- The **existence of all original nodes**, even if their appearance changes

Thus, while the **visual representation** can be whimsically altered, the **underlying information architecture** must remain intact.

**Allowed Changes List:**
- Text labels → replaced with fun icons
- Straight lines → transformed into winding paths
- Color scheme → changed to bold, child-friendly colors
- Font style → changed to storybook-style
- Background → can be redesigned with trees, creatures, etc.
- Node shapes → can be stylized (e.g., pirate chests, caves, castles)
- Additional decorative elements → allowed (trees, dragons, stars, etc.)
- Overall aesthetic → shifted from professional to whimsical

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
To preserve the core identity and function of the original image, we must retain the **informational logic** and **structural integrity**, even if the visual form changes.

**Core recognition elements:**  
While this is not a famous artwork, the **hierarchical structure** of the site map is its core identity. The **relationships between nodes** define its purpose as a site architecture plan. For example:
- "PRODUCTS & SOLUTIONS" must still contain "Products," "Solutions," "Services," and "Tech Support"
- "About Us" must include "Our Team," "History," "Clients," etc.
- The **footer** must still contain "Privacy Policy" and "Site Map"
- The **Homepage** must remain the central root node
- The **key legend** must still exist and correctly associate colors with levels

These are essential to maintain the **functionality** of the diagram as a site map. Without them, the edited version would no longer serve its intended purpose.

**Functional/logical association elements:**  
The **connectivity between nodes** must be preserved. For instance:
- "Product #1" must still be under "Products"
- "Bio #1" must still be under "Our Team"
- "Case Study #1" must still be under "Success Stories"

Changing these connections would alter the meaning of the site map.

**Non-modified element deduction:**  
Even though the instruction allows changing icons and styles, the **presence and placement of each node** within the hierarchy must be retained. This includes:
- The **number of nodes** at each level
- The **branching pattern** (e.g., "Events & Resources" has three sub-pages: News, Events, Links)
- The **position of the key** in the bottom-right corner
- The **logo** in the top-left corner ("to the web")

These are not mentioned as being removable, so they should be preserved in some form, even if stylized.

**Preservation Targets List:**
- The **hierarchical relationship** between all nodes (e.g., Products → Product #1)
- The **existence of all original nodes** (even if represented by icons)
- The **connection paths** between nodes (must remain logically consistent)
- The **placement of the SITE MAP KEY** in the bottom-right
- The **presence of the "to the web" logo** in the top-left
- The **footer section** containing Privacy Policy and Site Map
- The **original number and grouping** of nodes per category (e.g., 3 case studies, 3 bios)

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The presence of the "HOMEPAGE" node at the top center is the core identity feature of the site map. It serves as the root of the entire structure and contains the mission statement. Even if stylized as a castle, its position and role as the starting point must be preserved. Losing it would break the site map’s functionality and identity.
    Question: Is there a central root node labeled or represented as "HOMEPAGE" positioned at the top center of the diagram?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The branching structure from the Homepage to the five main categories (Products & Solutions, About Us, etc.) defines the primary navigation. The existence of exactly five first-level nodes is critical to maintaining the original architecture. Even if replaced with icons, their number and connection to the homepage must be preserved.
    Question: Are there exactly five primary branches originating from the HOMEPAGE node, corresponding to PRODUCTS & SOLUTIONS, ABOUT US, EVENTS & RESOURCES, SUCCESS STORIES, and CONTACT US?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The "SITE MAP KEY" is a functional component that explains the color coding of the levels. Its absence would make the map unreadable. Even if stylized, it must remain present and correctly positioned in the bottom-right corner to maintain informational consistency.
    Question: Is there a legend labeled "SITE MAP KEY" located in the bottom-right corner of the image, showing color codes for different levels?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The "to the web" logo in the top-left corner is a branding element and part of the original composition. While it may be stylized, its presence is required to maintain attribution and visual coherence with the source. Removing it would alter the image’s origin identity.
    Question: Is the "to the web" logo present in the top-left corner of the image?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The footer section with "Privacy Policy" and "Site Map" is a structural element that maintains the completeness of the site architecture. Even if transformed into a treasure chest or scroll, these two items must remain under the FOOTER label to preserve the site’s navigational logic.
    Question: Is there a FOOTER section containing "Privacy Policy" and "Site Map" below the main content area?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The number of case studies listed under "SUCCESS STORIES" is three (Case Study #1, #2, #3). This count is a specific detail that must be preserved to maintain data accuracy. Even if represented as treasure maps or scrolls, the quantity must remain three.
    Question: Are there exactly three nodes under the "SUCCESS STORIES" section, labeled or represented as Case Study #1, #2, and #3?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}
{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The "Product Details" node is a fourth-level item under "Product #3," indicated by a red box. Its presence signifies a deep-level page in the architecture. While it may be iconified, its hierarchical position under Product #3 must be preserved.
    Question: Is there a node labeled or represented as "Product Details" located directly under "Product #3"?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
