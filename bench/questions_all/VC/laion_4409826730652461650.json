      "thinking_process": "The tan and white fur pattern, particularly the white blaze on the face and chest patch, is a core identity feature of this specific plush horse model. It distinguishes it from other rocking horses and is essential for recognition. Losing this pattern would result in a different animal or toy being depicted, undermining the connection to the original product. This is a key visual identifier, hence a weight of 3 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The dark brown mane and tail are distinctive features that contribute to the horse’s appearance and species identification. They are consistent across the original image and serve as part of the plush toy's aesthetic signature. Removing or altering their color or texture would change the visual identity of the horse. This is a core recognition element, thus assigned 3 points.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The brown fabric bridle with a wooden handle is a functional and iconic accessory of the toy. It is clearly visible in the original image and defines the horse’s design. In a cartoon adaptation, even if stylized, the presence of a bridle and handle must be preserved to maintain the toy’s identity. Its absence would make the character unrecognizable as the original product. Hence, it is a core element with a weight of 3 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The four dark brown wheels attached to the legs are a functional feature of the toy, enabling rolling movement. They are a defining characteristic of this specific model and differentiate it from traditional wooden rocking horses. Their removal or replacement would alter the toy’s identity and functionality. This is a critical functional element, so it must be preserved. Assigned 3 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The light brown plastic rocking base with the “Rockin’ Rider” branding is a unique structural and commercial identifier of the product. The base shape and branding are integral to recognizing the toy’s origin. Even in a cartoon style, the base must retain its form and labeling to maintain authenticity. This is a key brand and functional element, thus assigned 3 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The white blaze on the face and chest patch is a secondary but distinct marking that contributes to the horse’s individuality. While less central than the fur pattern, its absence would reduce visual fidelity and recognition. It is a detail-level identifier, so it is important but not critical. Assigned 2 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The pink mouth and yellow eyes with black pupils are facial features that give the horse a friendly, expressive look. They are consistent in the original and help identify the character’s emotion. In a cartoon, they may be exaggerated, but their presence must be maintained for consistency. This is a minor detail but affects character recognition. Assigned 1 point.",

      "thinking_process": "The small red and yellow logo on the left ear is a brand-specific mark that identifies the manufacturer. It is a subtle but identifiable detail that adds authenticity. Its removal would reduce traceability to the original product. Though minor, it is a brand identifier, so it is worth 1 point.",
