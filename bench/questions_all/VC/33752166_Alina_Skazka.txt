Description of reference image: The subject is a tall, modern residential building captured from a low-angle perspective, emphasizing its verticality against a clear blue sky. The structure features a distinctive architectural design with two symmetrical wings extending upward and converging at the top, forming a V-shaped or Y-shaped silhouette. The facade is composed of light beige or cream-colored concrete panels, with rows of rectangular windows and balconies arranged in a repetitive grid pattern. Many balconies have yellow awnings or sunshades that are uniformly positioned, creating a rhythmic visual motif across multiple floors. Some balconies feature glass railings, while others have solid barriers or metal grilles. The building’s edges are sharp and angular, with protruding sections forming overhangs and recessed areas that add depth to the structure. The overall form is geometric and modular, typical of mid-20th-century Brutalist or modernist architecture. The sky serves as a plain, uncluttered background, providing high contrast to the building's complex geometry.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions word by word. The instruction states: “Transform the building into a giant mechanical golem with articulated limbs and exposed gears. The windows will become glowing panels of energy, while the balconies morph into arm-like appendages. Add intricate circuit patterns across its structure, detailing its monolithic, robotic appearance, and reimagine the building's angular edges as dynamic, moving parts.” This indicates that the **form and function** of the building are to be fundamentally altered—its identity transformed from a static architectural object into a sentient mechanical entity. However, no part of the instruction mentions altering or removing the **original architectural layout**, **spatial relationships**, or **structural logic** of the building’s base form. Instead, it implies a *transformation* rather than a complete replacement, suggesting that the underlying **geometry and spatial configuration** should remain recognizable beneath the new mechanical overlay.

Allowed Changes List:
- The overall form of the building (e.g., turning it into a golem)
- The material texture (e.g., replacing concrete with metallic surfaces)
- The function of windows (e.g., transforming them into glowing energy panels)
- The function of balconies (e.g., reimagining them as arm-like appendages)
- The appearance of edges (e.g., making them dynamic, moving parts)
- Addition of mechanical elements such as gears, circuits, and joints
- Visual effects like glow, lighting, and motion cues

Step 2 - Determine the elements that should remain unchanged  
Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements: Although the building is being transformed into a mechanical golem, the original architectural identity is not explicitly discarded. The instruction does not say "replace" or "erase" the building; instead, it says "transform." This suggests the **original structural layout**—specifically the V-shaped dual-wing configuration and the stacked, modular floor plan—should remain intact as the foundational form. These are the core identity features of the building, distinguishing it from other structures. If the V-shape or the tiered balcony arrangement were lost, the transformation would lose its reference point, making it unrecognizable as a modification of this specific building.

Functional/logical association elements: The balconies’ positions and their relationship to the windows must remain consistent because they are being repurposed as arms. If their locations were changed arbitrarily, the transformation would lack coherence. Similarly, the vertical alignment of floors and the symmetry between the two wings must be preserved to maintain logical continuity in the mechanical reinterpretation.

Non-modified element deduction: After excluding allowed changes (e.g., materials, functions), what remains are the **spatial relationships**, **geometric proportions**, **window-balcony alignment**, and **overall silhouette**. These are not mentioned for change and are essential for maintaining visual consistency between the original and edited versions. Even if the building becomes robotic, the underlying grid and shape must be retained to ensure the viewer recognizes the source.

Preservation Targets List:  
- The V-shaped dual-wing silhouette of the building  
- The stacked, modular arrangement of floors  
- The horizontal alignment of windows and balconies across each level  
- The symmetrical positioning of the two wings relative to the central axis  
- The presence and placement of yellow awnings on balconies  
- The clear separation between window sections and balcony overhangs  

Q1:  
Thinking process: The V-shaped dual-wing silhouette is the most iconic and defining feature of the building, responsible for its unique architectural identity. It is the primary visual cue that distinguishes this structure from others. If this shape is altered or obscured, the building cannot be recognized as the same original structure, even under transformation. Therefore, preserving this silhouette is critical for maintaining the reference integrity of the image.  
Question: Is the V-shaped dual-wing silhouette of the building preserved in the edited version?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The stacked, modular arrangement of floors forms the backbone of the building’s structure. Each floor follows a consistent pattern of windows and balconies, creating a rhythmic vertical progression. This repetition is essential for identifying the building’s architectural style and scale. Changing this arrangement would disrupt the structural logic and make the transformation appear arbitrary.  
Question: Are the floors stacked in a consistent, repeating modular pattern from bottom to top?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The horizontal alignment of windows and balconies across each level is a key detail that maintains the building’s orderly design. This alignment ensures visual balance and reinforces the grid-based layout. If windows or balconies are misaligned or repositioned, the coherence of the original structure is compromised, even if mechanical elements are added.  
Question: Are the windows and balconies aligned horizontally on each floor?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The symmetrical positioning of the two wings around a central axis is a fundamental aspect of the building’s design. This symmetry contributes to its aesthetic balance and architectural harmony. Altering this symmetry would distort the original form and break the intended visual relationship between the wings.  
Question: Are the two wings of the building symmetrically positioned relative to the central vertical axis?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The yellow awnings on the balconies are a distinctive color feature that adds visual rhythm and contrast to the otherwise neutral facade. Their presence and placement are consistent across multiple levels, contributing to the building’s identity. While the instruction allows transformation of balconies into arms, it does not specify removal of the awnings, so their original position should be preserved unless integrated into the mechanical design.  
Question: Are the yellow awnings present on the balconies in their original positions?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The clear separation between window sections and balcony overhangs defines the building’s layered depth and structural clarity. This separation creates a distinct visual hierarchy and prevents confusion between functional zones. Losing this distinction would blur the architectural details and reduce the recognizability of the original form.  
Question: Is there a visible separation between the window openings and the projecting balcony overhangs on each floor?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
