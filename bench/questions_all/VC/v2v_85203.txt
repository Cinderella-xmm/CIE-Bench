### Step 1 - Analyze Allowed Changes

**Description of Reference Image:**  
The subject is a serene blue butterfly with vibrant cerulean wings, positioned centrally against a neutral beige background. The butterfly has distinct wing patterns, a slender body, and two antennae. Below the butterfly, there is a dark silhouette resembling a rugged landscape or chasm.

**Thinking Process:**  
The editing instructions call for a radical transformation of the butterfly into a dynamic vortex of swirling energy while retaining its essence. The scene below the butterfly is described as a chasm of fractured, glossy obsidian. The instructions also mention an atmospheric change to a mystical, nebulous setting.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
1. **Butterfly Form:** The butterfly's physical form can be reinterpreted as a swirling vortex of energy.  
2. **Wings:** The wings can leave faint trails of light, altering their appearance.  
3. **Scene Environment:** The neutral beige background can be transformed into a mystical, nebulous atmosphere.  
4. **Lower Mass:** The dark silhouette can be reimagined as a chasm of fractured, glossy obsidian.  

### Step 2 - Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged

**Thinking Process:**  
- **Core Recognition Elements:** The butterfly's core identity lies in its blue color and central positioning. These features must be retained even if the form changes.  
- **Functional/Logical Association Elements:** The butterfly's hovering position above the lower mass must be preserved to maintain logical consistency.  
- **Remaining Elements:** The dark silhouette's general shape and the butterfly's central placement should be retained for visual coherence.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
1. The butterfly's central position in the image.  
2. The butterfly's blue color theme.  
3. The dark silhouette's general shape below the butterfly.  
4. The hovering relationship between the butterfly and the lower mass.
