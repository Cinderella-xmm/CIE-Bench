      "thinking_process": "The railway trestle bridge’s truss supports are a defining structural feature visible in the original image. Their wooden lattice framework and diagonal bracing pattern are unique to this type of bridge and distinguish it from modern bridges. If removed or replaced with a solid beam or different support system, the bridge would lose its identifiable character. Since the instruction only says the bridge becomes a neon-lit pathway, not that its structure is erased, the truss design must be preserved. This is a core identity element with a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Are the wooden truss supports of the railway bridge clearly visible and structurally intact?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The river flows directly beneath the bridge and is a key geographical feature separating the park from the city. Its presence is essential for the spatial logic of the scene. Even if lit or stylized, its continuous path from left to right under the bridge must remain. Removing or redirecting the river would violate the scene’s foundational geography. This is an important scene element with a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the river present and flowing continuously beneath the bridge?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The red-brick buildings in the park, particularly the one with the chimney, are distinctive due to their historical architectural style and color. They serve as a visual contrast to the modern skyline and add depth to the foreground. While not central to the futuristic theme, they are not mentioned for transformation, so their retention maintains scene authenticity. Their absence would create a gap in the park’s visual narrative. This is an important scene element with a weight of 2 points.",
      "question": "Are the red-brick buildings with gabled roofs and chimneys visible in the park area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The green park area with manicured lawns and pathways provides a natural buffer between the city and the river. Its presence contributes to the image’s balance and realism. Although trees may be transformed, the grassy fields and paved paths are not mentioned for alteration. Removing or replacing them would distort the park’s function and appearance. This is a secondary detail but necessary for visual coherence, hence a weight of 2 points.",
      "question": "Are the green lawns and paved pathways in the park area clearly visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The spatial relationship between the bridge, river, and skyline establishes the image’s depth and perspective. The bridge leads the eye toward the city, which is positioned behind the park and river. Altering this arrangement (e.g., placing the city in front of the river) would destroy the scene’s logic. Even with futuristic elements, this compositional order must remain. This is a critical logical element with a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the city skyline located behind the river and bridge, maintaining the original depth order?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The dual railroad tracks running along the bridge are a functional detail that defines its purpose. Even if illuminated or stylized, their presence as parallel rails must be preserved to retain the bridge’s identity as a rail structure. Replacing them with a single path or removing them entirely would misrepresent the original object. This is a minor but important functional detail with a weight of 1 point.",
      "question": "Are two parallel railroad tracks visible along the length of the bridge?",

        "Yes",
