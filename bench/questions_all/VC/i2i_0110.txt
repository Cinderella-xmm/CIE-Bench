Description of reference image: The subject is Vincent van Gogh's famous sunflower painting featuring a vase filled with sunflowers in different states of bloom. The sunflowers have bright golden petals, some fully bloomed, others wilted, and a few still budding. Their stems and leaves are painted in green with visible brushstrokes. The vase is off-white with hints of yellow and has a handwritten signature saying "Vincent." The painting is executed in an impressionistic style with thick, textured brushstrokes. The background is a simple, textured blue surface, providing contrast to the vibrant yellow flowers.

Thinking process:  
Analyzing the instructions thoroughly, we find that the background and setting can be entirely changed to a modern kitchen dining table with sunlight coming through venetian blinds. However, the core identity of the painting (the vase with sunflowers) should remain unchanged. This includes the arrangement, colors, and brushstroke style. The functional relationship between the vase and sunflowers is intrinsic, ensuring the integrity of the composition.

Allowed Changes List:  
- The background can be replaced with a modern kitchen setting.  
- The lighting condition can mimic sunlight streaming through venetian blinds.  
- The table surface beneath the vase can be changed to a modern dining table.

### Step 2 - Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged

Thinking process:
- **Core recognition elements**: The unique brushstroke texture, the sunflower colors, the shapes of the sunflowers, and the signature "Vincent" on the vase are iconic to this painting. These elements ensure the work remains recognizable.
- **Functional/logical associations**: The positioning of the sunflowers in the vase must remain intact to preserve the artwork's integrity. The vase's shape and color should also be retained since they are central to the piece.
- **Remaining elements based on coherence**: The natural placement of the leaves and stems, along with the overall tone and arrangement of the flowers, should remain unchanged to maintain visual consistency.

Preservation Targets List:  
- The unique brushstrokes and texture style  
- The bright yellow color and shapes of the sunflowers  
- The positioning of the sunflowers in the vase  
- The off-white and yellow color of the vase with the signature "Vincent"  
- The natural placement of leaves and stems
