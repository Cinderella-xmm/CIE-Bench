      "thinking_process": "SpongeBob’s yellow square porous body is the most fundamental identifier of the character. If the shape is altered (e.g., rounded, cylindrical), or the color changed from yellow, or the pores removed, the character cannot be recognized as SpongeBob. This is a core identity feature, making it a 3-point question.",
      "question": "Is SpongeBob depicted as a yellow, square-shaped sponge with multiple holes (pores) across his body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "SpongeBob’s large blue eyes with black pupils are signature facial features. Without them, especially with mismatched eye color or shape, the character loses recognizability. This is a critical facial identifier, thus weighted at 3 points.",
      "question": "Does SpongeBob have two large, round blue eyes with black pupils?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "SpongeBob’s two visible front teeth are an iconic trait. Their absence or replacement with different tooth shapes would significantly alter his identity. This is a core facial detail, essential for recognition, hence 3 points.",
      "question": "Are SpongeBob’s two front teeth clearly visible and rectangular in shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Patrick’s pink starfish form with five arms is essential for identification. Any deformation into a non-star shape or change in color would make him unrecognizable. This is a core anatomical feature, therefore 3 points.",
      "question": "Is Patrick depicted as a pink five-armed starfish with a rounded body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "Patrick’s wide open mouth with visible teeth is a defining expression. While the instruction allows dynamic poses, the expression style must remain consistent with his typical joyful demeanor. Loss of this expression could affect character identity. This is a key facial trait, so 2 points.",
      "question": "Does Patrick have a wide open mouth showing his teeth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "SpongeBob’s outfit — white shirt, red tie, brown square pants — is iconic. While the instruction allows shoe modification, the upper clothing must remain consistent. Changing the shirt color or removing the tie would damage recognition. This is a high-importance accessory set, so 2 points.",
      "question": "Is SpongeBob wearing a white shirt, red tie, and brown square pants?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "Patrick’s green shorts are a consistent element in his attire. While the jersey may change, the shorts are part of his standard look. Removing or altering their color would reduce consistency. This is a secondary but identifiable detail, so 1 point.",
      "question": "Is Patrick wearing green shorts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "thinking_process": "The presence of both characters together in a shared scene is implied as necessary for the image to retain its narrative. Even if poses change, their coexistence is essential. Separation or removal of one would break the intended relationship. This is a functional scene element, so 2 points.",
      "question": "Are both SpongeBob and Patrick present in the same frame and positioned close to each other?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
