Description of reference image: The subject is a man dressed in formal attire consisting of a checkered suit jacket, a striped dress shirt, and a detailed patterned tie. He is wearing glasses and has a somewhat serious facial expression. The man appears to be middle-aged with short-cropped hair. The background is blurred, likely indicating an outdoor setting with indistinct movement and light sources creating bokeh effects.

Thinking process:  
First, analyze the instructions that clearly state what can be changed. The subject's jumping pose implies changing his posture entirely. Since the image is to be transformed into an illustration style with a graffiti and concrete texture background, the original background can be replaced. The bold outline and hand-drawn style indicate alterations in the art form but still retaining the subject's likeness and distinct features.

Allowed Changes List:  
1. The posture of the subject to a jumping pose.  
2. The art style to a bold outline hand-drawn style.  
3. The background to abstract graffiti mixed with concrete texture.  

Step 2 - Determine the elements that should remain unchanged  
Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements include the man's distinct formal outfit, face shape, glasses, and tie pattern. The hand-drawn style transformation should retain these elements to keep his identity recognizable. Functional/logical association elements, in this case, relate to ensuring his formal attire aligns with his new dynamic pose, as this is a key aspect of the editing goal. Remaining visual coherence elements include details like the suit's checkered pattern and tie design, which contribute to his identity.

 Preservation Targets List:  
1. The man's formal outfit (suit jacket, shirt, tie).  
2. The man's face shape and glasses.  
3. The pattern details on the tie and suit.
