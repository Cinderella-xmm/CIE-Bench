**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a woman wearing a traditional Korean hanbok, standing in front of a historical palace structure resembling Gyeongbokgung Palace in Seoul. Her hair is styled in an elaborate updo with ornate silver hairpins, including one shaped like a small floral or geometric pendant. She wears long, dangling earrings with intricate designs, possibly crystal or beadwork. The hanbok consists of a light pink jeogori (top) with wide sleeves featuring delicate floral embroidery in pastel hues—pink, yellow, blue, and green—on a shimmering satin-like fabric. A golden-yellow ribbon (daenggi) is tied in a bow at the center of the chest. The chima (skirt) is a soft sky-blue color, layered and flowing. She carries a modern-style pink crossbody bag with a gold chain strap, which contrasts with the traditional attire. The background features a traditional Korean palace gate with multi-tiered, curved roofs, red pillars, green decorative beams, and tiled roofing. The sky is overcast, giving a neutral tone to the lighting.

Thinking process:  
The editing instructions specify:  
- "Create a decorative stamp series featuring the hanbok’s intricacies in a paper-cut style" → This implies transformation of the **visual representation** of the hanbok into a stylized, artistic form (paper-cut), but not necessarily changing the actual design elements.  
- "Accentuate the floral embroideries with metallic foils" → Allows enhancement of existing floral patterns using metallic finishes; the **presence and placement** of floral motifs must be retained.  
- "Enlarge the bow for emphasis" → Explicitly allows modification of the **size and prominence** of the bow on the jeogori.  
- "Select traditional Korean architecture as the backdrop" → Confirms that the **architectural setting must remain**, though it may be reimagined stylistically.  
- "Present the set on embossed leather-bound panel for a professional finish" → Indicates the final output will be framed or displayed differently, but does **not alter the content** of the subject or scene unless explicitly stated.

Thus, changes allowed include:
- Stylization of the hanbok into paper-cut art.
- Use of metallic foil effects on floral embroidery.
- Enlargement of the bow.
- Artistic reinterpretation of the architectural backdrop (as long as it remains traditional Korean).
- Presentation format (embossed panel) — this affects display, not content.

Allowed Changes List:  
- Size and proportion of the bow (can be enlarged).  
- Visual texture and material effect of floral embroidery (can be enhanced with metallic foils).  
- Artistic style of the hanbok (can be rendered in paper-cut aesthetic).  
- Background architectural rendering (can be stylized, but must remain traditional Korean).  
- Display medium (embossed leather panel) — does not affect core visual content.

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements:  
- The **hanbok’s distinctive structure** (jeogori and chima) is essential to identify the subject as wearing traditional Korean clothing. Even if stylized, the two-part garment configuration must remain.  
- The **floral embroidery pattern** on the sleeves and collar area is unique to the specific hanbok design and serves as a key identifier. While metallic foils can enhance it, the **presence and layout** of the flowers must be preserved.  
- The **color scheme** of the hanbok — particularly the **light pink jeogori**, **sky-blue chima**, and **golden-yellow daenggi** — defines its identity. These colors are part of the cultural and aesthetic signature.  
- The **traditional Korean palace architecture** in the background is explicitly required by the instruction to be retained ("select traditional Korean architecture as the backdrop"). Therefore, the **overall silhouette and iconic features** (curved roofs, red columns, green eaves, tile pattern) must remain recognizable.  

Functional/logical association elements:  
- The **spatial relationship** between the subject and the palace must be maintained — she should appear in front of the building, preserving the logical context of a person in a historical setting.  
- The **position of accessories**: earrings, hairpins, and handbag must retain their **relative positions** on the body unless otherwise specified. However, the **modern handbag** is a non-traditional element; since it's not mentioned in the instructions as being removed or altered, it may be retained, but its presence could be inconsistent with a fully traditional theme. Yet, since it exists in the original image and no instruction removes it, it should be considered part of the subject’s appearance unless contradicted.

Non-modified element deduction:  
After excluding allowed changes (bow size, metallic foils, paper-cut style), all other **specific details** of the hanbok and environment must be preserved:  
- The **shape and arrangement of floral patterns** on the sleeves and collar.  
- The **exact location and design of the hairpins** (especially the central pendant-shaped one).  
- The **dangling earrings’ shape and length**.  
- The **texture and fold lines of the fabric** (satin sheen, flow of chima).  
- The **architectural features** such as roof curvature, column spacing, and decorative beams.

Preservation Targets List:  
- The presence and position of floral embroidery on the sleeves and collar of the hanbok.  
- The light pink jeogori and sky-blue chima color combination.  
- The golden-yellow daenggi ribbon tied at the chest.  
- The traditional Korean palace with curved roofs, red pillars, and green eaves in the background.  
- The subject’s hairstyle with silver hairpins, especially the central pendant-shaped pin.  
- The dangling earrings with intricate design.  
- The spatial positioning of the subject in front of the palace.  
- The modern pink crossbody bag with gold chain (if present in original, and not instructed to remove).

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

Q1:  
Thinking process: The floral embroidery on the sleeves and collar is a core identifying feature of this particular hanbok design. Its presence, distribution, and relative position define the garment’s aesthetic and cultural specificity. If lost or replaced, the hanbok would lose its distinct identity. Since the instruction only allows accentuation with metallic foils, the **original pattern must remain visible and unaltered in placement**. This is a key identification element, so it receives a weight of 3 points.  
Question: Are the floral embroidery patterns on the sleeves and collar of the hanbok clearly visible and in their original positions?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3

Q2:  
Thinking process: The color of the jeogori (light pink) and chima (sky-blue) is a defining characteristic of this hanbok’s visual identity. Changing these colors would result in a different cultural interpretation or misrepresentation. The instruction does not permit color change, only enhancement via metallic foils. Thus, the **base colors must be preserved**. This is a core identity feature, so it receives 3 points.  
Question: Is the jeogori light pink and the chima sky-blue in color?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3

Q3:  
Thinking process: The golden-yellow daenggi ribbon tied at the chest is a functional and symbolic element of the hanbok. It is a key structural detail that identifies the garment’s closure method. Although the instruction allows enlarging the bow, it does not allow removing or relocating it. Therefore, its **presence and central position** must be retained. This is a critical functional and aesthetic element, hence 3 points.  
Question: Is there a golden-yellow ribbon tied in a bow at the center of the chest on the jeogori?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3

Q4:  
Thinking process: The traditional Korean palace in the background is explicitly required by the instruction to be retained. Its architectural features — curved roofs, red pillars, green eaves — are iconic and distinguishable. Any loss of these features would break the contextual authenticity. While stylization is allowed, the **core silhouette and structural elements** must remain. This is a key scene element, so it receives 3 points.  
Question: Is the background a traditional Korean palace with multiple curved roofs, red pillars, and green decorative beams?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3

Q5:  
Thinking process: The hairstyle, particularly the silver hairpins, including the central pendant-shaped one, is a distinctive cultural accessory. Its design and placement are specific to the subject’s appearance and contribute to her identity. The instruction does not mention altering hair or pins, so they must remain. This is a key accessory detail, hence 2 points.  
Question: Is the woman’s hair styled in an updo with silver hairpins, including a central pendant-shaped pin?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2

Q6:  
Thinking process: The dangling earrings with intricate design are a key facial accessory and part of the subject’s overall look. They are visually prominent and contribute to the elegance of the portrait. Since no instruction specifies removal or redesign, they must be preserved. This is a secondary but identifiable detail, so 2 points.  
Question: Are there long, dangling earrings with detailed designs visible on both ears?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2

Q7:  
Thinking process: The modern pink crossbody bag with a gold chain is a non-traditional element but present in the original image. Since the instruction does not mention removing it, and it is part of the subject’s current appearance, it should be retained. Its presence adds contrast and may reflect a fusion theme, but its **position and design** must be preserved for consistency. This is a minor detail but contributes to coherence.  
Question: Is a pink crossbody bag with a gold chain strap visible on the woman’s shoulder?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1

Q8:  
Thinking process: The subject’s position in front of the palace establishes the spatial logic of the scene. Moving her behind or beside the building would disrupt the intended composition. The instruction requires the palace as backdrop, implying the subject remains in front. This is a logical spatial element, so it receives 2 points.  
Question: Is the woman positioned in front of the palace, facing forward?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2
