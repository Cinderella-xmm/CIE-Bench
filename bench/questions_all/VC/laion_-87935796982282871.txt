**Step 1 – Analyze the editing instructions and determine allowed changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a neatly made bed with a black wooden headboard, positioned centrally in a modern bedroom setting. The comforter features a layered design: a solid red bottom section, a gray quilted middle band, and a navy blue top edge with white piping. A small square decorative pillow with a red, navy, and white plaid pattern rests at the center of the bed. Two standard pillows are stacked behind it—one plain white and one with thin horizontal stripes in white and light gray. The bed stands on four dark legs and is placed on a fluffy, light gray shag rug. To the left of the bed is a black tripod floor lamp with a white drum shade, standing beside a woven gray pouf topped with two books (one red, one black). To the right, a wooden nightstand holds a stack of books (blue and white), a red textured lantern, and a small green potted plant. A gray upholstered stool with wooden legs sits nearby. The wall is painted a neutral light gray, and the flooring is medium-toned wood.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction explicitly transforms the bed into a "cozy woodland creature" by altering its form and components:
- **Bed → woodland creature**: The entire structure of the bed is to be reimagined as an animal.
- **Comforter → patchwork fur**: The blanket’s colors (red, gray, navy) are to become the animal’s fur texture, implying that the color scheme must be preserved but repurposed.
- **Pillows → alert ears trimmed with soft leaves**: The pillows are replaced with ear-like structures, but their original position and function (as head support) are implied to be retained spatially.
- **Bed frame → slender, branch-like legs**: The original black wooden frame is to be replaced with naturalistic limbs.
- **Add bushy, plush red tail from comforter**: A new element (tail) is added, extending from the bottom of the comforter.

From this, we can deduce:
- The **form of the bed** (its rectangular shape, size, and placement) is being changed — allowed.
- The **comforter’s color blocks** (red, gray, navy) are to be used as fur patterns — **colors must remain**, but texture and shape may change.
- The **pillows’ position and role** (top of bed) are likely preserved, though their form changes — **placement is key**.
- The **bed frame** is replaced — allowed.
- The **flooring, rug, lamp, nightstand, books, plant, etc.** are not mentioned — they may be altered or removed unless specified.

**Allowed Changes List:**
- The shape and structure of the bed frame
- The form and material of the pillows (transformed into ears)
- The appearance of the comforter (reimagined as fur)
- The addition of a red tail
- The replacement of the bed legs with branch-like ones
- The transformation of the overall bed into a creature form

**Step 2 – Determine the elements that should remain unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
We now identify what **must not change** based on the above analysis:

1. **Core recognition elements**:
   - The **color palette** of the comforter (red, gray, navy blue) is central to the transformation ("patchwork fur of the blanket's colors"). This is not just aesthetic—it defines the creature’s identity. Changing these colors would break the visual logic of the edit.
   - The **position and arrangement** of the bedding elements (especially the red section at the bottom, gray middle, navy top) must be preserved in relative terms, even if reinterpreted as fur patches. This maintains continuity between the original and transformed image.
   - The **presence and location** of the plaid accent pillow must be preserved — it is a distinct visual feature and will likely become part of the creature’s face or body marking.

2. **Functional/logical association elements**:
   - The **bed’s position in the room** (centered, facing forward) must be retained for spatial coherence. Even as a creature, it should occupy the same space and orientation.
   - The **relationship between the comforter and the pillows** — the pillows rest atop the comforter — must be maintained in layout, even if their forms change. This ensures logical continuity in how the creature is assembled.

3. **Non-modified element deduction**:
   - The **shag rug beneath the bed** must remain visible and in place — it anchors the scene and provides context.
   - The **light gray wall** and **wooden flooring** are background elements not mentioned for change; thus, they should remain to preserve environmental consistency.
   - The **tripod lamp**, **pouf**, **nightstand**, **books**, and **plant** are not referenced in the instruction — they are ambient details that should stay unless removed for compositional reasons. However, since no instruction says to remove them, they should be preserved for scene integrity.

**Preservation Targets List:**
- The red, gray, and navy blue color blocks of the comforter
- The position and presence of the plaid accent pillow
- The spatial arrangement of the pillows atop the comforter
- The location of the bed within the room (centered, on the rug)
- The presence and placement of the shag rug
- The light gray wall and wooden floor
- The tripod floor lamp and its position
- The nightstand, books, plant, and stool

**Step 3 – Generate yes/no questions targeting key visual elements**

Q1:  
Thinking process: The red, gray, and navy blue color blocks are the core visual identity of the comforter and serve as the basis for the "patchwork fur" transformation. These specific colors define the creature’s appearance and are essential for maintaining continuity between the original and edited image. Losing any of these colors would fundamentally alter the intended design. Therefore, this is a core identity element with a weight of 3 points.  
Question: Are the red, gray, and navy blue sections of the comforter present in the edited image, preserving their original color distribution?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The plaid accent pillow is a distinctive feature in the original image, located centrally on the bed. It adds contrast and detail to the composition. In the transformed version, it may become part of the creature’s facial markings or body pattern, but its presence and location are critical for visual continuity. Its absence would disrupt the recognizable layout. Thus, it is a key accessory with a weight of 2 points.  
Question: Is the small square plaid pillow (with red, navy, and white checks) still present on the bed, positioned near the center?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The spatial relationship between the pillows and the comforter is essential for logical coherence. The pillows rest on top of the comforter in the original image, and this layering must be preserved in the transformation to maintain realism in the creature’s form. If the pillows were moved below or detached, it would break the functional logic of bedding. This is a structural/functional element with a weight of 2 points.  
Question: Do the pillows remain positioned on top of the comforter, maintaining their original stacking order and placement?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The shag rug beneath the bed provides grounding and defines the space. Its presence is crucial for environmental consistency. Removing or replacing it would shift the scene’s atmosphere and undermine the original setting. While not a core identity element, it is a key environmental anchor, so it has a weight of 2 points.  
Question: Is the light gray shag rug still present beneath the bed, covering the floor in front of it?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The tripod floor lamp is a prominent object in the scene, contributing to lighting and decor. Its position to the left of the bed is fixed in the original image. Since it is not mentioned in the editing instruction, it should remain unchanged. Its removal or relocation would disrupt the balance of the room. This is a minor but important detail with a weight of 1 point.  
Question: Is the black tripod floor lamp with a white drum shade still positioned to the left of the bed?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The nightstand with books, plant, and red lantern is part of the room’s ambiance. Though not central to the transformation, its presence helps establish the setting. The instruction does not mention removing it, so it should remain. Its preservation supports scene coherence. This is a secondary detail with a weight of 1 point.  
Question: Is the wooden nightstand with books, red lantern, and green plant still present to the right of the bed?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The wall color and flooring are background elements that define the room’s tone. Light gray walls and wooden floors are not referenced for change, so they must remain to preserve the original environment. Their alteration would create a different setting entirely. This is a contextual detail with a weight of 1 point.  
Question: Are the light gray wall and medium-toned wooden floor still visible in the background?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1
