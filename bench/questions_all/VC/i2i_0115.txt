Description of reference image: This image is Edvard Munch's famous painting "The Scream." It features a distorted figure in the foreground with long, flowing limbs and an exaggerated screaming posture. The figure has elongated fingers covering its ears, a bald, rounded head, and a gaping mouth open in a scream. The figure is dressed in a loosely sketched blue garment. The background consists of a wavy, undulating landscape with a bridge curving towards the horizon. The color palette includes shades of red, orange, yellow, blue, and green, contributing to an intense, dreamlike atmosphere. The bridge is lined with a few other figures walking away, depicted in stark simplicity.

### Step 1 - Allowed Changes List

Thinking process: The editing instructions specify replacing the river bend and bridge background with a battlefield scene featuring explosions. Therefore, the following elements may change:

1. **Background scene**: The river, bridge, and distant landscape can be replaced with a battlefield.
2. **Color and atmosphere**: The colors and mood might change to match the battlefield setting.
  
### Step 2 - Preservation Targets List

Thinking process: The core recognition and functional elements that should be retained include:

- The figure's iconic screaming posture and facial expression, as changing this would lose the essence of the painting.
- The figure's placement and orientation (standing on the bridge) to maintain logical connection with the new scene.
- The general abstract and expressive style of the painting.

#### Core Recognition Elements
- The screaming figure's exaggerated expression and posture are iconic.
- The blue garment and pale face are distinctive features.
- The distorted, swirling lines defining the figure's body.

#### Functional/Logical Association Elements
- The positioning of the figure on the bridge aligns with the composition of the original scene and should be retained if possible.

#### Remaining Elements Based on Visual Coherence
- The expressive color palette and brushstroke style should remain consistent with the original aesthetic.
