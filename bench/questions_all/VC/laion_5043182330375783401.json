      "thinking_process": "The mustache is a defining facial feature in this portrait, critical for identifying the subject. Its presence and shape are central to the figure’s identity. Even under Art Deco stylization, its core form—thick, curved, and centered above the upper lip—must be preserved to maintain recognition. Losing it would fundamentally alter the subject’s identity.",
      "question": "Is the mustache present and clearly defined above the upper lip?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The closed eyes are a key emotional and compositional element, conveying introspection or calmness. They define the facial expression and contribute to the overall mood. In any stylized version, the eyes must remain closed to preserve the intended psychological state of the figure.",
      "question": "Are both eyes closed in the facial expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The seated posture, particularly the arm resting on the back of the chair, establishes the figure’s interaction with the environment. This gesture is integral to the composition and cannot be removed or replaced with a standing or reclining pose without changing the scene’s logic. The arm’s position relative to the chair must remain consistent.",
      "question": "Is the figure’s right arm resting on the back of the chair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The figure is seated, which implies physical contact with the chair and a stable lower-body posture. Even if the chair is stylized, the figure must remain in a seated position to maintain functional logic. Standing or floating would contradict the original scene.",
      "question": "Is the figure depicted in a seated position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The catalog number “27826” is a real-world identifier, likely part of the artwork’s provenance. It is a fixed textual element in the bottom right corner. Unless explicitly instructed to remove it, it must be preserved as a factual detail tied to the original image.",
      "question": "Is the number “27826” visible in the bottom right corner of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
