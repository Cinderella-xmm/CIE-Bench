      "thinking_process": "The red eye lenses are a core identification feature of this mecha model. In the Gundam series, eye color and shape are critical for distinguishing units, especially when combined with the angular head design. Removing or changing the red lenses would fundamentally alter the robot’s identity and prevent recognition. This is a 3-point element because it is a signature visual trait directly tied to the character’s identity.",
      "question": "Are the red eye lenses present in the head of the robot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The orange thruster nozzles on the feet are functionally significant and visually distinct. They are located symmetrically on both feet and serve as propulsion indicators. Their presence is essential to maintaining the design logic and aesthetic balance. Losing them would break the symmetry and reduce the mechanical credibility of the design. This is a 3-point element due to its role in both function and visual identity.",
      "question": "Are there three orange circular thruster nozzles on each foot of the robot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The large sword held in the left hand is a primary weapon and a defining feature of this unit’s combat configuration. Its size and positioning relative to the body are key to understanding the robot’s role as a close-combat variant. Replacing or omitting it would change the intended usage narrative. This is a 3-point element because it is central to the robot’s functional identity.",
      "question": "Is a long, straight sword being held in the robot’s left hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The wing-like structures on the back with orange-tipped edges are distinctive aerodynamic features that contribute to the robot’s silhouette. They are not just decorative but are part of the unit’s profile recognition. Changing their shape or removing the orange tips would affect visual coherence and brand consistency. This is a 2-point element because it is important for silhouette recognition but less critical than the face or weapons.",
      "question": "Are there two wing-like structures on the back of the robot, each with an orange tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The rifle held in the right hand is another core weapon component. Its design, including the barrel length and magazine shape, is consistent with the robot’s arsenal. Removing or replacing it would alter the combat profile. While it may be replaced in the collectible version, the original image must retain it for consistency. This is a 2-point element because it is a major accessory tied to the unit’s function.",
      "question": "Is a long rifle being held in the robot’s right hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The gray and white color scheme with orange accents is a defining characteristic of this mecha model. The color distribution across the body, particularly the orange markings on the shoulders and wings, is essential for identification. Any deviation would make it unrecognizable as this specific unit. This is a 3-point element because color is a primary identifier in mecha design.",
      "question": "Is the robot primarily colored in gray and white with orange accent markings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The dynamic pose with bent legs and raised arms indicates movement and action. The specific angle of the limbs contributes to the sense of motion and combat readiness. Altering this pose would affect the narrative context. While articulation might allow variation in the collectible, the original pose must be preserved. This is a 2-point element because it affects the emotional and functional expression of the robot.",
      "question": "Is the robot posed with one leg bent forward and the other extended backward, suggesting forward motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The copyright notice \"©SOTSU·SUNRISE\" is a legal and branding element present in the original image. It identifies the intellectual property owner and must be retained in any faithful representation. Its absence would indicate unauthorized modification. This is a 1-point element because it is a textual detail, but it is necessary for authenticity.",
      "question": "Is the text \"©SOTSU·SUNRISE\" visible in the bottom-left corner of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
