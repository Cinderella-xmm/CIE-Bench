Description of reference image: The subject is a realistic black-and-white cow standing in a grassy field under a bright blue sky with scattered white clouds. The cow has a predominantly white coat with large, irregular black patches distributed across its body, including a prominent black patch over the left shoulder and side, and another extending from the neck down to the chest. Its face features a distinct black marking around the eyes and ears, with a white blaze running down the center of the forehead and snout. The cow has two curved, light-colored horns with dark tips, and its ears are large, dark, and slightly flared outward. The nose is pinkish-brown with visible nostrils, and the mouth area shows a slight droop with a small amount of saliva hanging from the lower lip. The cow stands upright on all four legs, positioned slightly angled toward the viewer, with its head facing forward. In front of the cow, placed on the grass, is a vintage-style CRT television with a black casing, a rectangular screen, a speaker grille on the right side, and several control knobs at the bottom. The TV is turned off, showing a dark reflective surface. The background consists of a vibrant green grassy field with tall blades of grass in the foreground, and a clear sky with soft, fluffy cumulus clouds. The lighting is natural daylight, casting subtle shadows beneath the cow and the TV.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions word by word. The instruction specifies transforming the cow into a "stylized 3D chibi character," which implies a significant change in form, proportion, and style—thus allowing changes to the cow’s overall shape, size, and anatomical structure. However, it explicitly states to "carefully retain its black-and-white coat patterns" and "cheerful personality." This means the color pattern (black and white patches) must be preserved, even if stylized. The instruction also requires placing the cow leaning against a vintage television with both front hooves atop the screen, so the presence and function of the TV as an object must be retained, though its position and interaction with the cow may change. The scene is to be set in a grassy field with a bright sky and 3D-modeled clouds, indicating that the general environment (field, sky, clouds) can be reimagined but not necessarily altered in core elements like grass or sky type. The instruction does not mention changing the coat pattern, horn shape, or facial markings, so these are implied to be preserved. The TV's vintage design is referenced, suggesting its retro aesthetic should remain recognizable.

Allowed Changes List:
- The cow’s form and proportions (due to "chibi" transformation)
- The cow’s posture (from standing upright to leaning against TV)
- The cow’s facial expression (to reflect a "mischievous grin")
- The cow’s size and scale (as part of chibi stylization)
- The TV’s placement (now being leaned against, with hooves on screen)
- The artistic style (transition to 3D stylized rendering)
- The sky and cloud details (replaced with 3D-modeled clouds)
- The grass texture and field layout (can be stylized)

Step 2- Determine the elements that should remain unchanged

Thinking process:
Core recognition elements: The black-and-white coat pattern is explicitly stated to be retained. This is a key identifier for the cow species (Holstein Friesian), and the specific distribution of patches—especially the large black patch on the left shoulder and the white blaze on the face—is essential for visual identity. The horns’ shape and color (curved, light with dark tips) are distinctive features that define the animal’s breed and should be preserved. The presence of the vintage television is required by the instruction, and although its position changes, its functional role (as a prop for the cow to interact with) and physical characteristics (CRT design, speaker grille, control knobs) must remain identifiable. The grassy field and sky are mentioned as part of the new scene, but since they are not specified to be changed in content, their basic nature (green grass, blue sky with clouds) should be retained, though stylized.

Functional/logical association elements: The interaction between the cow and the TV is critical—the cow must lean against it with hooves on the screen. This establishes a logical spatial relationship that must be preserved. The TV must remain a functional object in the scene, not replaced by another device. The cow’s hooves must be positioned on the screen, maintaining the action described.

Non modified element deduction: After excluding allowed changes (form, posture, style), the remaining unmentioned visual details—such as the exact shape of the black patches, the horn curvature, the ear shape, the nose color, and the TV’s design—are implicitly required to be retained due to their role in preserving the original subject’s identity and the scene’s coherence. These elements are not explicitly changed in the instruction and are necessary for continuity.

Preservation Targets List:
- The black-and-white coat pattern, particularly the large black patch on the left shoulder and the white blaze on the face
- The shape and color of the horns (curved, light with dark tips)
- The presence and design of the vintage CRT television (including speaker grille and control knobs)
- The grassy field and sky with clouds as environmental context
- The cow’s facial features (dark eyes, pinkish-brown nose, visible nostrils)
- The positioning of the cow’s hooves on the TV screen

Q1:  
Thinking process: The black-and-white coat pattern is the core identity feature of the Holstein cow, and the instruction explicitly requires retaining it. The specific distribution of patches—especially the large black patch on the left shoulder and the white blaze on the face—is essential for distinguishing this cow from others. Losing this pattern would make the subject unrecognizable as the original cow. Therefore, this is a key identification element with a weight of 3 points.  
Question: Is the large black patch on the left shoulder of the cow present and clearly defined?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The white blaze running down the center of the cow’s face is a distinctive facial marking that contributes to its identity. It is a consistent feature in Holstein cows and helps distinguish them from other breeds. Since the instruction emphasizes retaining the coat patterns, this facial marking must be preserved. Its absence would alter the cow’s appearance significantly. This is a core recognition element, hence a weight of 3 points.  
Question: Is there a continuous white stripe running down the center of the cow’s face from the forehead to the snout?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The horns are a defining physical trait of the cow, and their curved shape with light color and dark tips is a unique detail that contributes to the animal’s identity. The instruction does not allow modification of this feature, so it must be preserved. Changing the horn shape or color would misrepresent the original subject. This is a core recognition element, thus assigned 3 points.  
Question: Are the cow’s horns curved upward and outward, with a light base and dark tips?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The vintage CRT television is a key object in the scene and is explicitly mentioned in the instruction. Its design—specifically the speaker grille on the right side and the control knobs at the bottom—is essential for identifying it as a retro TV. Although its position changes, its form must remain recognizable. This is a functional and iconic element, so it is assigned 2 points.  
Question: Does the television have a speaker grille on the right side and multiple control knobs at the bottom?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The cow’s hooves must be placed on the TV screen as per the instruction. This establishes a logical interaction between the subject and the object. The presence of the hooves on the screen is a functional requirement and must be preserved to maintain scene coherence. This is an important scene element, so it is assigned 2 points.  
Question: Are both front hooves of the cow positioned on top of the television screen?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The grassy field and sky with clouds provide the environmental context. While the instruction allows stylization, the basic elements—green grass and a blue sky with white clouds—must remain to preserve the outdoor setting. The grass texture and cloud shapes are secondary but contribute to visual consistency. This is a minor detail, so it is assigned 1 point.  
Question: Is the background composed of a green grassy field under a blue sky with white clouds?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The cow’s nose is a key facial feature, with a pinkish-brown color and visible nostrils. This detail contributes to the realism and identity of the animal. Although the style may change, the color and structure of the nose should be preserved. This is a minor but identifiable detail, so it is assigned 1 point.  
Question: Is the cow’s nose pinkish-brown with clearly visible nostrils?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1
