      "thinking_process": "The MK logo charm is a globally recognized symbol of the Michael Kors brand. Its circular shape, gold-tone finish, and interlocked \"MK\" initials are critical for brand identification. If this element is absent or altered in form, the edited image would lose its connection to the original product, making it unrecognizable as a Michael Kors item. Therefore, this is a core identity element with a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the circular gold-tone MK logo charm present and clearly visible on the model’s attire or accessories?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The \"MICHAEL KORS\" text is a key branding element placed on the bag. Its presence ensures brand recognition and authenticity. Even when transformed into a fashion show context, this text must be preserved in form and position (or adapted in a way that maintains legibility and placement). Losing it would undermine the product’s identity, making it a high-priority retention element with a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the \"MICHAEL KORS\" brand name visible in gold uppercase letters near the upper right area of the model’s attire?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The black pebbled leather texture is a defining material characteristic of this bag. It distinguishes it from smoother or different-textured designs. In the anthropomorphic version, the dress must reflect this texture visually to maintain continuity with the original product. Without it, the transformation loses its grounding in the source object. This is a core visual attribute, thus assigned 3 points.",
      "question": "Does the model’s dress feature a black pebbled texture resembling the original bag’s surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The gold-tone hardware, including buckles, zippers, and clasps, is a recurring design motif that reinforces the luxury aesthetic. These elements are not just decorative but functional in the original bag. In the transformed image, they should appear as jewelry or structural details in gold tone to maintain visual consistency. Their absence would break the thematic link to the original product, so they are important enough to warrant 2 points.",
      "question": "Are gold-tone hardware elements (such as buckles, zippers, or clasps) visibly incorporated into the model’s accessories or outfit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The side zip pocket with a gold-tone zipper pull is a specific functional detail that adds to the bag’s identity. While it may not be central to the overall design, its inclusion helps confirm the authenticity of the original object. In the anthropomorphic version, this detail could be translated into a seam or accessory on the dress. Retaining it ensures fidelity to the original design at a detail level, earning it 1 point.",
      "question": "Is a zippered pocket with a gold-tone pull visible on the side of the model’s dress or outfit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The position and shape of the handles are key structural features of the bag. Though the handles will be transformed into limbs or part of the posture in the anthropomorphic version, their curvature and attachment points should be reflected in the model’s stance or arm positioning. This maintains the logical flow of the transformation and supports visual coherence. As a secondary structural cue, it receives 1 point.",
      "question": "Are the curved handle shapes reflected in the model’s arm or posture alignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
