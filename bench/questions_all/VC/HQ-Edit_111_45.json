      "thinking_process": "The anvil is a core functional object in the scene, uniquely defined by its blocky rectangular base and elongated pointed horn. Its shape is iconic and necessary for identifying the activity as blacksmithing. Even if stylized, its fundamental silhouette must remain intact to preserve the scene’s identity. Losing this would make the scene unrecognizable as a forge. Therefore, this is a 3-point core element.",
      "question": "Is the anvil present with a blocky rectangular base and a pointed horn?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The glowing metal object on the anvil is the focal point of the action. Its luminous red-orange color and placement directly on the anvil surface indicate it is being forged. This is a key functional element — without it, the hammering action lacks purpose. Its presence and position are essential to the scene’s logic. Thus, it is a 3-point core element.",
      "question": "Is there a glowing red-orange metal object resting on the anvil?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The hammer is actively striking the metal, and its motion is central to the scene. Even if transformed into a divine instrument, the act of hammering must be visually preserved. The hammer must be depicted in contact with or about to strike the metal. This is a functional action element critical to the narrative. Therefore, it is a 2-point important element.",
      "question": "Is the hammer positioned above or in contact with the glowing metal on the anvil?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The tongs are used to hold the hot metal, and their presence is essential for the action to make sense. They must be visible in the blacksmith’s hand, gripping the metal. Even if stylized, their functional role must be clear. This is a 2-point important accessory element.",
      "question": "Are tongs visible in the blacksmith’s left hand, holding the glowing metal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The wooden stump supports the anvil and is a minor but consistent environmental detail. It grounds the anvil in the scene and contributes to the workshop setting. While not core, its absence would disrupt visual coherence. Thus, it is a 1-point detail element.",
      "question": "Is the anvil placed on a circular wooden stump?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The stone furnace in the background emits light and heat, providing context for the forge. Its arched opening and glowing interior are key to the environment. Even if stylized, its presence and location must be retained to maintain scene logic. This is a 2-point important scene element.",
      "question": "Is there a stone furnace with a glowing interior visible in the background to the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The second blacksmith figure in the background adds depth and context to the scene. His presence near the furnace suggests a working forge. Even if stylized, his position and general form must be preserved to maintain the scene’s narrative. This is a 1-point detail element.",
      "question": "Is there a second figure in similar attire standing near the furnace in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "thinking_process": "The arched stone architecture defines the setting as a medieval forge. The arches and stonework are characteristic of the environment. Their preservation ensures the scene remains grounded in the original setting. This is a 2-point important scene element.",
      "question": "Are there arched stone doorways visible in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
