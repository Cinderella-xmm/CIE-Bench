      "thinking_process": "The presence of two triangular sails—one large mainsail and one smaller jib—is the defining characteristic of this specific sailboat design. Their arrangement and shape are essential for identifying the vessel as a traditional dhow-style boat. If either sail is missing, reshaped into a square or rectangular form, or repositioned incorrectly, the boat loses its iconic silhouette and becomes unrecognizable. This is a core identity feature, hence weight 3.",
      "question": "Are both the main triangular sail and the smaller jib sail present and correctly positioned on the mast?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The single central mast is structurally critical and visually dominant. Its placement directly behind the deck and extending vertically through the center of the boat defines the balance and function of the vessel. Removing or shifting it would fundamentally alter the boat’s design and make it inconsistent with the original. This is a core structural element, so it must be preserved.",
      "question": "Is there a single vertical mast located centrally along the length of the boat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The pointed bow is a key silhouette feature that distinguishes this boat from other types, such as flat-bottomed or rounded-hull vessels. Its sharp, upward curve at the front is part of the boat’s signature profile. Altering or flattening it would change the vessel’s identity. This is a core visual identifier.",
      "question": "Does the boat have a sharply pointed bow extending forward from the hull?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The covered deck with open sides and vertical railings is a unique architectural detail that identifies the boat as a historically inspired vessel with sheltered seating. This feature adds functional and aesthetic value and helps distinguish it from simpler boats. While the material may change, the form must remain intact. Losing this structure would reduce the boat’s recognizability.",
      "question": "Is there a covered section with open sides and vertical railings located over the midsection of the hull?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The small red flag at the stern is a distinct accessory that contributes to the boat’s identity and authenticity. Its position at the rear end of the vessel is consistent with maritime tradition. Removing or relocating it would result in a noticeable loss of detail and reduce the fidelity of the representation.",
      "question": "Is there a small red flag attached to the stern of the boat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The relative spatial arrangement of the sails, mast, deck, and bow defines the boat’s proportion and balance. For example, the mast must be centered, the sails must extend outward from it, and the deck must sit below the sails. Disrupting this layout—even slightly—would make the sculpture appear distorted or incorrect. This relational consistency is vital for accurate representation.",
      "question": "Are the sails, mast, deck, and bow aligned in their original spatial configuration, maintaining the correct proportions and orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
