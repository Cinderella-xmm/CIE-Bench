      "thinking_process": "The dragon motif is a culturally significant and visually dominant feature of the original garment. Its presence on the left chest, with detailed scales and flowing mane, is a core identifier of the traditional Chinese aesthetic. Removing or relocating it would fundamentally alter the identity of the garment and the cultural symbolism intended. Therefore, its existence and placement are critical for recognition and consistency.",
      "question": "Is the dragon embroidery clearly visible on the left side of the chest, with detailed scales and a raised texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The floral embroidery, especially the peony blossoms and vine patterns, forms a secondary but essential part of the textile design. These motifs are not generic but specifically placed along the right side of the dress. Their retention ensures continuity in the artistic composition and prevents the garment from appearing arbitrarily redesigned. They are key to maintaining the original aesthetic balance.",
      "question": "Are the peony and vine floral patterns visible along the right side of the dress, matching the original arrangement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The subject’s facial features — particularly the shape of the eyes, the fullness of the lips, and the symmetry of the face — are unique identifiers of her identity. Any alteration to these features would result in a different person being depicted, undermining the integrity of the portrait. Since no modification is requested to the face, it must remain unchanged.",
      "question": "Does the subject retain her original facial features, including the shape of the eyes, nose, and lips?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The hand position — clasped gently in front of the waist — is a deliberate compositional choice that conveys grace and restraint. Changing this would affect the emotional tone and balance of the portrait. As no instruction mentions altering the pose, the hand placement must be preserved for visual coherence.",
      "question": "Are the hands positioned together in front of the waist, fingers interlaced?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The red silk fabric has a distinct luster and weave texture that reflects light in a specific way, contributing to the realism and luxury of the garment. While the color palette may be enhanced, the underlying fabric texture must remain consistent to preserve the material authenticity. Losing this texture would make the garment appear synthetic or poorly rendered.",
      "question": "Is the red silk fabric visibly textured with a reflective sheen, showing fine weave details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The silhouette of the subject — including the curve of the spine, shoulder line, and arm contour — defines her physical form. Altering this would distort the anatomy and compromise the realism of the figure. Since no instruction specifies changing the body shape, the original proportions must be maintained.",
      "question": "Does the subject maintain the original body proportions, with a natural curvature of the spine and balanced shoulders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
