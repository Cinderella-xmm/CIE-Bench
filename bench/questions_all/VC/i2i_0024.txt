Description of reference image: The subject is a female tennis player positioned on a clay court, wearing an orange dress and a white visor. Her body is angled slightly to the right, holding a tennis racket in her right hand, with her left hand raised in a fist pump gesture. Her hair is tied back in a ponytail under the visor. The clay court is reddish-brown with distinct white boundary lines. The background includes green elements associated with the court setup.

### Step 1 - Allowed Changes List:

Thinking process:
The instructions indicate a transformation into a chibi-style flat illustration. This allows for changes in detailed textures, realistic skin tones, and shading. Elements like the tennis racket's design can be simplified. The background can also be simplified or removed entirely as long as essential elements required by the instructions (e.g., clay court lines) are preserved.

Allowed Changes List:
- Detailed textures of the dress and visor
- Realistic human features and proportions
- Racket design details
- Specific background details unrelated to the clay court lines

### Step 2 - Preservation Targets List:

Thinking process:
The core recognition elements include the tennis player’s pose, attire, and the clay court setting. Functional elements such as the racket's presence and the gesturing pose (victory sign) need to be retained. Remaining elements like the orange dress color and white visor contribute visual coherence.

Preservation Targets List:
- Pose (stance, arm positions)
- Clay court lines
- Orange dress and white visor (colors and basic shapes)
- Tennis racket (as a filled shape)
- Tennis-related gestures and actions (fist pump)
