      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "The silhouette of the vase — specifically its three-panel body, twin scrolled handles, and flared neck — defines its architectural identity. Even though it is transformed into crystal, the instruction requires mimicking the original shape. If this form is lost, the object would no longer resemble the original vase, undermining the continuity of the composition. This is a core structural feature, essential for recognizing the transformed object as a derivation of the original.",
      "question": "Is the vase's overall shape preserved, including its three-panel body, twin scrolled handles, and flared neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies that the flowers are to be converted into crystal blossoms but does not alter their spatial behavior. The original image shows an overflowing bouquet that spills beyond the vase. Retaining this dynamic ensures functional consistency — the vase remains a vessel for flowers, even if they are now crystal. Losing this overflow would disrupt the logical and visual narrative of abundance.",
      "question": "Does the bouquet extend beyond the rim of the vase, creating an overflowing effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The scattered flowers on the pedestal — specifically the pink poppy and blue blossoms — are part of the original composition’s realism and detail. They reinforce the idea of natural movement and imperfection. Though the instruction does not mention them directly, their absence would break visual coherence and suggest a sterile, artificial setting inconsistent with the original mood. Their presence is a key detail anchoring the scene.",
      "question": "Are there scattered flowers on the surface of the pedestal, including at least one pink poppy and blue blooms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The vase is centrally positioned in the frame, which is crucial for the balance and symmetry of the still-life composition. Changing its position would shift the visual focus and alter the intended aesthetic. Although the pedestal changes, the central placement is implied by the instruction to preserve the \"entire composition.\" This is a key compositional element.",
      "question": "Is the vase positioned centrally on the pedestal within the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The spatial relationship between the vase and the spilled flowers — particularly that some flowers lie directly on the pedestal surface — is essential for maintaining the sense of realism and depth. This detail contributes to the illusion of a natural, lived-in moment. Even if the flowers are now crystal, their physical location relative to the vase must remain consistent to preserve the original scene’s logic.",
      "question": "Do some of the flowers rest directly on the surface of the pedestal, separate from the main bouquet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
