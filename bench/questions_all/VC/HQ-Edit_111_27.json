Its presence and arrangement define her cultural role and distinguish her from other figures. Even if rendered in stained glass, the **structure of the updo**, **number and placement of hairpins**, and **ornamental flowers** must remain to preserve recognition. Losing these would make her unrecognizable as a geisha. Hence, this is a key identification element with weight 3.",

      "thinking_process": "The white face makeup with red lips and darkened eyes is a signature feature of traditional geisha portrayal. This is a core visual identifier that defines her identity. Even in stained glass, the **color contrast** and **specific facial markings** must remain. Altering or removing them would destroy the character’s authenticity.

      "thinking_process": "The fan is a functional object held in her left hand. Its **position** and **function** are essential to the pose. Although its form changes to a peacock fan, it must still be **held in the left hand** to maintain logical consistency. Changing its hand or removing it would break the action logic.

      "thinking_process": "The large red obi bow tied at the back is a distinctive detail of the kimono. It contributes to the visual balance and cultural accuracy. Though the kimono’s design changes, this **specific feature** is not mentioned for modification, so it must be preserved. It is a secondary but identifiable detail, hence weight 1.",
