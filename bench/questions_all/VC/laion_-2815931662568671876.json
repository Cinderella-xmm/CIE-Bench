      "thinking_process": "The texture of the tortilla chip is a core identifying feature—it distinguishes it from fried or raw chips. The rough, slightly cracked surface with visible salt granules is unique to baked tortilla chips and must be preserved even when anthropomorphized to maintain authenticity. Losing this would make the character unrecognizable as a real chip.",
      "question": "Is the coarse, slightly cracked texture of the largest tortilla chip retained, including visible salt crystals?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The color of the chip is essential for identity—baked tortilla chips have a distinct golden-brown hue with subtle variation. If changed to a uniform or unnatural color, it would no longer resemble a real baked chip, undermining the realism required even in a whimsical context.",
      "question": "Is the golden-brown color of the largest tortilla chip preserved, with natural tonal variation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The guacamole’s chunky texture is a key identifier—smooth or pureed guacamole would not match the original. The presence of visible avocado chunks and uneven surface confirms it is freshly made and authentic. This texture must remain even if animated.",
      "question": "Is the chunky, uneven texture of the guacamole mound preserved, showing visible avocado pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The green-yellow gradient of the guacamole reflects its natural composition. A solid green or artificial-looking color would break the connection to real food. Retaining this gradient ensures the dip remains visually plausible.",
      "question": "Is the green-yellow gradient of the guacamole preserved, showing natural avocado color variation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The material authenticity of the food items—meaning they do not appear cartoonishly smooth, shiny, or synthetic—is crucial. Even in a comic, the base materials must feel real. If the chip looks like paper or the guacamole like clay, the original substance is lost.",
      "question": "Are the chip and guacamole rendered with realistic material properties, avoiding glossy or plastic-like finishes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
