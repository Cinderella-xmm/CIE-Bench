**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a high-top athletic sneaker held in a person’s hand, positioned diagonally toward the camera. The shoe features a navy blue mesh upper with white synthetic overlays and a white midsole. On the lateral side, there is a prominent circular logo composed of a navy blue "C" shape enclosing a red semicircle at the top, resembling the Champion brand emblem. Three navy blue stripes run horizontally across the midsole, aligned with Adidas-style branding elements. The laces are navy blue and pass through reinforced eyelets with textured plastic clips. A small red label with "EQT" in white text is visible on the tongue area. The heel tab is white with a navy blue trim, and a white rectangular tag with "EQUIPMENT" printed in black appears near the collar. The background is an indoor parking garage with yellow structural pillars, concrete flooring, parked cars, and overhead fluorescent lighting. The hand holding the shoe wears a gold-colored metal-link wristwatch.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction explicitly states: *"Transform the sneaker into a modern energy drink can design."* This indicates that the **form and function of the subject (sneaker)** will be replaced entirely by a **cylindrical energy drink can**, meaning the original **three-dimensional structure of the shoe is no longer valid**. However, the instruction specifies **how to style the new can using visual elements from the shoe**, which implies certain **visual characteristics** must be preserved or transferred.

Key transformation points:
- The **subject form changes**: from sneaker → energy drink can.
- **Visual attributes** are to be carried over: navy blue mesh pattern, brand logo, laces as embossed texture, sole stripes as dynamic pattern, and “Kickstart” name in red.
- **Scene retention**: Not mentioned; therefore, the background (parking garage) is **not required to be preserved**.
- **Hand and watch**: Not mentioned for retention; thus, they may be changed or removed.
- **Color scheme**: Navy blue, white, red — these are specified as part of the design transfer and should be retained in their roles.

Allowed Changes List:
- The **physical form** of the subject (sneaker) → transformed into a cylindrical can.
- The **background environment** (parking garage) → not required to be kept.
- The **hand and watch** → not required to be preserved.
- The **spatial orientation** of the object → may change due to new form.
- The **material appearance** (e.g., textile mesh, rubber sole) → replaced with metallic can surface.
- The **function** of the object → changed from footwear to beverage container.

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
Even though the subject's form is being transformed, the **instructions specify that specific visual elements from the original shoe must be incorporated into the new design**. These are **not arbitrary additions** but **direct transfers** of key identity features. Therefore, we must identify what **core visual traits** from the original shoe are **explicitly referenced** in the editing instruction and thus **must be preserved in some form**.

Core recognition elements:
- **Brand logo**: The circular "C" with red semicircle is a **distinctive trademark symbol**. Its presence is essential for brand identification. Even if stylized, it must retain its **shape, color distribution, and placement** (on the front of the can).
- **Navy blue mesh pattern**: Described as a texture to be used on the can. This is a **key material attribute** of the original shoe and is explicitly referenced, so its **texture and color** must be preserved.
- **Laces as embossed texture**: The laces are not just decorative but serve as a **structural feature** in the original design. Their **arrangement, thickness, and direction** are to be replicated as **raised embossing** around the can — indicating this is a **critical design element**.
- **Sole stripes**: The three navy blue stripes on the white midsole are **iconic design elements** (reminiscent of Adidas). They are to be used as a **dynamic pattern on the bottom half of the can**, meaning their **number, color, and alignment** must be preserved.
- **Red lettering “Kickstart”**: Though not present in the original, it is derived from the existing **color palette** and **branding logic**. It is a **new addition**, so not a preservation target, but the **red color** comes from the original (logo and EQT tag), so red remains part of the **design language**.

Functional/logical association elements:
- The **relationship between the logo and the product** is critical. If the logo is lost or distorted, the brand identity fails.
- The **use of laces as texture** implies a **functional-to-aesthetic transformation**, but their **structure** must remain recognizable.

Non-modified element deduction:
- All other details not mentioned in the instruction — such as the **white collar**, **tongue tag**, **heel counter**, **interior lining**, **zipper**, etc. — are **not required to be preserved** because they are not referenced in the design transfer.
- The **hand and watch** are not part of the design brief and can be removed.
- The **background** is irrelevant to the final product and can be altered or removed.

Preservation Targets List:
- The **circular logo with navy blue "C" and red semicircle**
- The **navy blue mesh texture pattern**
- The **navy blue laces' arrangement and thickness**
- The **three navy blue stripes on the white base**
- The **red color used in branding elements (from original EQT tag and logo)**

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The circular logo with a navy blue "C" shape enclosing a red semicircle is the most iconic visual identifier of the brand on the shoe. It is explicitly stated in the instruction to be placed on the front of the can. Losing this exact shape and color combination would result in the loss of brand identity, making the can unrecognizable as derived from this specific shoe. Therefore, it is a core identity element and must be preserved exactly.
    Question: Is the circular logo featuring a navy blue "C" shape with a red semicircle at the top present on the front of the energy drink can?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The navy blue mesh pattern is a defining texture of the shoe's upper and is explicitly instructed to be used as the primary surface texture of the can. This texture gives the can its visual authenticity and connection to the original shoe. Altering or omitting this mesh pattern would break the continuity of the design transformation, making the can visually disconnected from the source.
    Question: Does the energy drink can feature the navy blue mesh texture across its main body surface?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The laces are described as being transformed into embossed texture around the can. Their arrangement, thickness, and crossing pattern are critical to maintaining the visual essence of the original shoe. If the lace structure is simplified or changed, the design loses its reference to the shoe’s functional aesthetic. Thus, the **specific configuration** of the laces must be preserved.
    Question: Are the navy blue laces depicted as raised embossed ridges wrapping around the middle section of the can in their original crisscross pattern?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The three navy blue stripes on the white midsole are a signature design element, reminiscent of Adidas branding. The instruction specifies they should form a dynamic pattern on the bottom half of the can. Their number, color, and alignment are essential to maintaining the visual link to the shoe. Changing their count or position would disrupt the design logic.
    Question: Are three navy blue stripes arranged horizontally across the lower portion of the can, matching the original shoe's stripe layout?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The red color appears in two key places on the original shoe: the logo’s semicircle and the "EQT" tag. The instruction uses red for the "Kickstart" text, implying the red color is a core part of the brand’s visual language. While the text itself is new, the **presence and use of red** as a branding accent must be retained to maintain consistency with the original shoe’s color scheme.
    Question: Is the word "Kickstart" displayed in red lettering on the upper portion of the can?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
