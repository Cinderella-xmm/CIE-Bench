      "thinking_process": "The distinctive coastline of North and South America, particularly the jagged outline of the Gulf Coast and the tapering shape of Central America, is a core geographical identifier in the original map. If this shape is altered beyond recognition, the map would no longer represent the Americas, undermining its identity. This is a key visual anchor, making it a 3-point question.",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the recognizable coastline shape of North and South America, including the Gulf of Mexico and the narrow isthmus of Central America?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The grid of latitude and longitude lines forms the structural backbone of the map. Its presence defines the cartographic nature of the image. Even if the map is transformed into a scroll, the grid must remain visible or implied to maintain the map’s functional integrity. Losing it would make the image lose its navigational purpose, hence a 2-point importance.",
      "question": "Are the latitude and longitude grid lines still visible or clearly implied in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The parchment texture—including its uneven discoloration, stains, and simulated paper grain—is essential to the antique aesthetic. Retaining this texture ensures continuity with the original’s vintage style. It is a defining visual characteristic that distinguishes it from modern maps. Its loss would result in a significant departure from the source, so it is a 2-point element.",
      "question": "Is the aged parchment texture, including stains and discoloration, preserved in the background of the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The original color scheme—dominated by sepia, gold, and muted green—is explicitly stated to be retained. Even with added glowing gold highlights, the base colors must remain consistent. Altering the base tones would disrupt the historical authenticity of the scene, making this a critical 2-point criterion.",
      "question": "Are the original sepia, gold, and green tones preserved as the dominant color palette in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The presence of handwritten script labels (e.g., “Oceano”) and ship illustrations is a key stylistic hallmark of historical maps. These elements contribute to the narrative and artistic authenticity. Their removal would strip the image of its period-specific charm and reduce its educational value. Thus, they are important secondary details worth 1 point.",
      "question": "Are at least two of the original handwritten script labels or ship illustrations visibly present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The compass’s golden metallic sheen and detailed engravings are central to its visual identity. Though it transforms into a ship’s wheel, the material quality and ornamental style must be carried over to maintain consistency. This is a functional and aesthetic bridge between old and new forms, warranting a 2-point weight.",
      "question": "Does the transformed compass (now a ship’s wheel) retain the golden metallic finish and intricate engraved patterns seen in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The map’s orientation with North at the top is a standard convention in cartography and supports logical interpretation. Even when rolled or repositioned, maintaining this orientation preserves navigational coherence and aligns with viewer expectations. It is a subtle but essential structural element, thus a 1-point detail.",
      "question": "Is the map oriented such that North remains at the top of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
