**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a female gymnast performing a handstand on the balance beam in an indoor gymnastics arena. She is captured mid-performance, executing a backbend with her legs extended upward and crossed at the ankles, forming a near-perfect arch. Her body is clad in a form-fitting leotard with a gradient design: silver on the torso and arms transitioning into deep blue on the lower back and legs. The leotard features subtle glittering accents along the spine and shoulder seams. Her hair is tied into a tight, neat bun secured with a light blue hair tie. She wears white gymnastic grips on her hands and chalk dust is visible on the beam beneath her palms. The background shows a blurred audience in tiered seating under bright overhead stadium lights, with a blue competition floor marked with white lines. The balance beam is wooden with a worn, slightly chipped surface, indicating frequent use.

Thinking process:  
The editing instructions specify several transformations:
- **"Create a gymnastics-themed art postcard set"**: This implies a stylistic transformation toward artistic interpretation rather than photorealism.
- **"Highlighting a contortionist's silhouette with a brushstroke effect"**: Indicates that the figure’s outline should be stylized with painterly strokes; the original form may be abstracted but must still represent a gymnast or contortionist.
- **"Enlarge the hands to emphasize grip strength"**: Explicitly allows modification of hand size—this is a changeable element.
- **"Elongate the legs for dynamic proportions"**: Leg length can be altered—proportions are not fixed.
- **"Use gradients of blue and silver to accentuate form"**: Color scheme is encouraged but not strictly bound to original hues; however, the original uses blue and silver, so these remain relevant.
- **"Include action motifs like swirling ribbons and stars"**: These are new additions, not present in the original—allowed to be added.
- **"Mount on matt-finish panels with corner-rounded edges"**: This refers to presentation format, not content—does not affect core visual elements of the image itself.

From this analysis, the following elements are explicitly allowed to change:
- Proportions (especially leg length and hand size)
- Artistic style (brushstroke effect, silhouette treatment)
- Additions of symbolic elements (ribbons, stars)
- Color grading (though blue/silver palette is suggested, not mandated)
- Presentation format (postcard mount)

Allowed Changes List:
- Hand size (enlarged)
- Leg length (converted for dynamism)
- Body proportions (stylized for dramatic effect)
- Presence of decorative motifs (swirling ribbons, stars)
- Brushstroke texture applied to silhouette
- Overall color tone (within blue/silver gradient range)
- Background complexity (may be simplified or abstracted)
- Lighting effects (can be enhanced artistically)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements must be preserved because they define the identity of the subject and scene. Even if stylized, the subject must remain recognizable as a **female gymnast performing a handstand on a balance beam**. Key identifiers include:
- The **presence of the balance beam**, which is central to the action and context.
- The **gymnast’s posture**: specifically, the handstand with bent back and elevated legs—this defines the athletic moment.
- The **leotard’s color scheme and design**: while colors may shift within blue/silver, the contrast between silver upper body and dark blue lower half is a distinctive feature.
- The **hair tied in a bun with a blue hair tie**: this detail contributes to character identity and realism.
- The **chalking on hands and beam**: functional evidence of performance, reinforcing authenticity.

Functional/logical association elements:
- The **position of hands on the beam** is essential for the action to make sense—without it, the handstand becomes implausible.
- The **beam’s orientation and placement** relative to the gymnast must be maintained to preserve spatial logic.
- The **floor markings and gym environment** provide contextual grounding—though blurred, their presence helps establish setting.

Non-modified element deduction:
After excluding allowed changes (hand size, leg length, artistic effects), remaining unmentioned visual details must be retained for coherence:
- The **texture of the beam** (wooden, worn surface) adds realism.
- The **gymnast’s facial profile** (side view, focused expression) supports narrative.
- The **earring** (small stud earring) is a personal detail that anchors character identity.
- The **grips on hands** indicate equipment used in gymnastics.

Preservation Targets List:
- The balance beam as a physical object with wooden texture and chipped surface
- The gymnast’s handstand pose with bent back and elevated legs
- The silver-and-blue leotard with gradient transition and sparkling details
- The bun hairstyle secured with a blue hair tie
- The small stud earring on the left ear
- The chalk residue on the beam and hands
- The side-facing profile of the face with focused gaze
- The position of hands gripping the beam

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Retained Visual Elements**

Q1:  
Thinking process: The balance beam is the foundational object enabling the gymnast’s performance. Its presence, material (wooden), and worn surface texture are key to identifying the setting as a real gymnastics competition. If removed or replaced with another object (e.g., a pole or platform), the scene loses its core functionality and identity. Therefore, preserving the beam’s physical characteristics is critical for maintaining the scene’s authenticity and purpose.  
Question: Is the balance beam made of wood with visible wear and chipped paint?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The handstand pose—specifically the inverted arch with legs raised and crossed—is the defining movement of the gymnast. It communicates both skill and control. Altering this posture fundamentally changes the nature of the action and could misrepresent the sport. While proportions may be elongated, the core shape of the backbend must remain intact to preserve the athletic intent.  
Question: Does the gymnast maintain a handstand with her body arched backward and legs lifted vertically above her head?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The leotard’s gradient from silver on the torso to blue on the lower body is a distinctive visual signature. While the exact shade may vary, the two-tone structure and glittering pattern along the spine are unique to the original image. Removing or altering this design would obscure the athlete’s appearance and reduce visual coherence.  
Question: Is the leotard divided into silver upper body and blue lower body with a gradient transition and sparkles along the spine?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The bun hairstyle with a blue hair tie is a specific personal detail that contributes to the gymnast’s identity. In competitive gymnastics, such grooming is standard and visually distinct. Changing the hairstyle or removing the hair tie would alter the character’s appearance significantly, especially in a stylized rendering where such details help anchor realism.  
Question: Is the gymnast’s hair styled in a tight bun secured with a blue hair tie?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The presence of chalk residue on the beam and hands indicates preparation for grip and reflects real-world gymnastics practices. This detail grounds the image in authenticity and connects the performer to the equipment. Removing it would make the scene appear less realistic or staged.  
Question: Are there visible chalk marks on the balance beam beneath the gymnast’s hands?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The small stud earring on the left ear is a subtle but identifiable feature that adds individuality to the character. While minor, such accessories contribute to visual consistency and prevent the figure from appearing generic. In artistic interpretations, retaining such details helps preserve the original subject’s likeness.  
Question: Is there a small stud earring visible on the gymnast’s left ear?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The side profile of the face with a focused gaze downward is crucial for conveying concentration and emotional engagement. This expression aligns with the intensity of competitive gymnastics. Altering the facial direction or expression could misrepresent the athlete’s state during performance.  
Question: Is the gymnast’s face turned sideways with her eyes looking downward toward the beam?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q8:  
Thinking process: The hands gripping the beam are functionally essential—they support the entire body weight in the handstand. Even if enlarged, their placement and contact with the beam must remain consistent to maintain logical action. Moving or repositioning them would break the physics of the pose.  
Question: Are the gymnast’s hands placed flat on top of the beam, supporting her body in a handstand?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q9:  
Thinking process: The gloves (or grips) on the hands are part of standard gymnastics gear. Their presence reinforces the authenticity of the performance. While the instruction allows enlargement of hands, the grips themselves should remain identifiable as protective equipment.  
Question: Are white gymnastic grips visible on the gymnast’s hands?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q10:  
Thinking process: The background includes a blurred audience and stadium lighting, establishing the setting as a formal competition. While the instruction allows abstraction, the general structure of tiered seating and bright ceiling lights must remain to preserve the context of a public event. Removing these would isolate the figure and lose environmental meaning.  
Question: Is there a blurred audience in tiered seating behind the gymnast, illuminated by overhead stadium lights?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2
