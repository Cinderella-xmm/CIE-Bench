Description of reference image: The subject consists of two modern, stainless steel toasters placed side by side on a wooden surface. Each toaster has a slice of bread partially toasted inside, with the bread rising slightly above the slots. The toasters have metallic finishes, black control knobs, and levers for lowering the bread. In the background, thereâ€™s a clean, bright kitchen setting with white subway tiles, some green plants, and other kitchenware items softly blurred.

### Step 1 - Allowed Changes List:

**Thinking process:**  
Analyze the editing instructions carefully. The instructions indicate that the kitchen background should be replaced with an outdoor camping scene, and the toasters should be positioned on a folding table with sunlight illuminating the toast. Therefore, the kitchen background elements, such as the plants and tiles, may change. However, the core attributes and details of the toasters and bread must be kept intact.

- **Specific element 1 that allows for changes:** The background environment, including the kitchen wall, tiles, and other kitchen items. These can be replaced with the outdoor camping scene.
- **Specific element 2 that allows for changes:** The countertop can be changed to a folding table.
- **Specific element 3 that allows for changes:** Lighting conditions can be adjusted to include sunlight.

### Step 2 - Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged:

**Thinking process:**  
Core recognition elements of the toasters and toast, such as their shape, design, metallic finish, and the state of the bread, must remain unchanged since they define the objects. Functional elements, like the lever positions and knob placements, also need to stay consistent. Remaining visual details, such as the metallic sheen and bread texture, enhance image coherence.

- **Element 1 that should be maintained:** Shape and design of the toasters (iconic forms and metallic finish).
- **Element 2 that should be maintained:** Position and appearance of the bread slices inside the toasters (to retain the logical function of the appliance).
- **Element 3 that should be maintained:** Control knobs and levers (functional/logical association elements).
- **Element 4 that should be maintained:** Textures and reflective properties of the metallic surfaces.

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The shape and design of the toasters are key recognition elements. If altered, the toasters might lose their identity as modern appliances.
    Question: Are the toasters still rectangular with a smooth metallic finish?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

}

{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The bread slices are integral for understanding the toaster's function. Their appearance should remain consistent for clarity.
    Question: Is the bread still rising slightly above the toaster slots with visible toast marks?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The control knobs and levers are essential functional parts of the toaster for maintaining its identity.
    Question: Are the black control knobs and levers still present on the toasters?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The reflective metallic surfaces enhance the realism and identity of the toasters.
    Question: Do the toasters retain their reflective metallic sheen?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1

{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The positioning of toasters relative to each other maintains the visual coherence of the original setup.
    Question: Are the two toasters still placed side by side on the same surface?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
