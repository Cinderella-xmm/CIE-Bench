      "thinking_process": "The skull face on the rear fender is a core artistic feature unique to this design. Its presence, expression (grinning teeth, hollow eyes), and location directly identify the custom decal set. If removed or altered beyond recognition, the design loses its identity. It is a signature element of MR Stiker’s branding.",
      "question": "Is the skull face with grinning teeth and hollow eyes located on the rear fender of the motorcycle?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The second skull face on the front headlight cowl is symmetrically paired with the rear one and forms part of the dual-iconic theme. Its removal or modification would break the visual balance and branding continuity. It is equally essential for identification.",
      "question": "Is there a skull face with grinning teeth and hollow eyes positioned on the front headlight cowl?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The blue angular stripe pattern defines the “semi full striping” style. Its shape, sharp angles, and flow across the fuel tank, side panels, and front fairing are unique to this design. Changing it would make the LEGO version unrecognizable as the same skin.",
      "question": "Are the blue angular stripes present along the fuel tank, side panels, and front fairing in the same geometric configuration as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The “V-SDI” and “VFORCE3” decals are functional branding elements placed on the lower side panel. Their text and position are critical for authenticity. Even when converted to LEGO tiles, their content and placement must remain unchanged.",
      "question": "Is the “V-SDI” and “VFORCE3” decal visible on the lower side panel near the foot peg area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The motorcycle’s side profile orientation (facing right) is fundamental to how the design is marketed and recognized. Reversing or rotating it would disrupt visual coherence and misalign with the original layout.",
      "question": "Is the motorcycle shown in a side profile view facing toward the right side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The relative position of the exhaust pipe beneath the seat and extending backward is a structural detail that helps identify the bike model and design. Altering its path or attachment point would affect realism and recognition.",
      "question": "Is the exhaust pipe located beneath the seat and curving downward toward the rear wheel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The seat shape and contour are part of the scooter's identity. While minor, preserving its rounded back and smooth surface ensures accurate representation of the original vehicle.",
      "question": "Does the seat have a smooth, slightly curved surface with a raised backrest?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
