      "thinking_process": "The red lipstick is a core visual identifier of the subject’s fashion-forward persona. It is a distinct, saturated color that contrasts sharply with skin tone and serves as a signature feature in the original image. Its presence is crucial for maintaining the subject’s recognizable identity; if omitted or changed to a different shade, the character’s distinctive look would be compromised. Therefore, this is a key identification feature and must be retained exactly as seen in the original image.",
      "question": "Is the subject wearing bright red lipstick?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The black sunglasses are another defining feature of the subject’s appearance. Their large, angular shape and reflective lenses contribute significantly to the overall fashion aesthetic. They are positioned centrally on the face and cover the eyes, which is essential for maintaining the subject’s composed, stylish demeanor. Any alteration in shape, color, or placement would disrupt facial recognition and the intended mood. Hence, this is a core identity element.",

      "thinking_process": "The subject’s hairstyle—short, neatly pulled back from the face—is a unique detail contributing to her polished appearance. This specific grooming style distinguishes her from other figures and supports the fashion theme. Changing it would alter her visual identity and reduce consistency with the original portrayal. While not as iconic as the lipstick or glasses, it is still a key facial framing element.",
      "question": "Is the subject’s hair pulled back tightly, revealing her forehead and ears?",

      "thinking_process": "The woman is holding shopping bags in both hands, which is a functional and narrative element of the scene. The act of carrying bags defines the context of shopping and fashion consumption. Even though the bags themselves may be redesigned, the physical gesture—hands gripping handles, arms extended—must remain intact to preserve the logic of the action. Altering hand position would break the coherence of the scene.",

      "thinking_process": "The light pink turtleneck is visible beneath the coat and provides contrast to the darker outerwear. Its color and snug fit are part of the outfit’s layered structure. Since the instruction only modifies the coat’s texture and color, not the inner garment, this element must remain unchanged. It contributes to the fashion ensemble and helps define the subject’s clothing hierarchy.",

      "thinking_process": "The dark gray skirt is a secondary but identifiable component of the outfit. Its color and mid-length cut are consistent with the overall sophisticated fashion look. It anchors the lower half of the figure and balances the upper body styling. Although not as prominent as the coat or accessories, its retention ensures full fidelity to the original attire.",

      "thinking_process": "The lighting direction creates strong shadows on the right side of the face and body, indicating a light source from the upper left. This directional illumination is a key compositional element that adds depth and drama. Preserving the shadow placement ensures the three-dimensional quality of the figure remains consistent, even if the background changes.",
