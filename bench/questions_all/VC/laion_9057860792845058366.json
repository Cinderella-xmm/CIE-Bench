      "thinking_process": "The orange horn-like protrusions on the head are a signature feature of this robot model, serving as a key identifier distinguishing it from other mecha designs. Their shape, position, and color are critical for recognition. If they are altered or removed, the robot would lose its distinct identity. This is a core visual trait that cannot be changed without compromising the subject’s authenticity.",
      "question": "Are the two orange horn-like protrusions on the top of the robot's head present and unchanged in shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The red rectangular chest plate is a dominant visual feature, defining the robot’s torso and contributing significantly to its color scheme and silhouette. Its presence and shape are essential for identification. Any distortion or replacement would fundamentally alter the robot’s appearance and break continuity with the original design.",
      "question": "Is the large red rectangular plate on the robot's chest intact, maintaining its original size, shape, and placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The red knee pads are part of the robot’s consistent color-blocking pattern and contribute to its balanced aesthetic. They are located symmetrically on both legs and serve as a recognizable detail. Removing or changing them would affect the visual balance and reduce fidelity to the original model.",
      "question": "Are the red knee pads present on both legs, positioned at the joint area and matching the original shape and color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The black-gloved hands are a functional and stylistic detail that define the robot’s articulation and design language. They are clearly defined in the original and must remain consistent to preserve the model’s mechanical realism. Altering their shape or color would disrupt the visual logic of the design.",
      "question": "Are the hands of the robot fully black, with a claw-like or articulated finger design, and positioned as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The angular, blocky feet with black toe sections are unique to this robot’s design and contribute to its grounded, mechanical stance. Their shape and color contrast are important for identifying the model. Changing them would affect the robot’s posture and visual integrity.",
      "question": "Do the robot’s feet maintain their angular, blocky shape with black toe segments and red accent plates near the ankles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The robot’s overall pose—dynamic, slightly leaning forward with one arm raised—is a key aspect of its presentation. This posture defines its action-ready stance and is integral to its visual character. Changing the pose would alter the impression and reduce consistency with the original.",
      "question": "Is the robot in the same dynamic standing pose, with the left arm slightly raised and the body angled toward the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The color scheme—white, gray, red, and orange—is central to the robot’s identity. While the instruction allows for a metallic gloss, the base colors must remain unchanged. Altering the primary colors (e.g., making the red blue) would misrepresent the original design and destroy its recognizability.",
      "question": "Are the primary colors of the robot—white, gray, red, and orange—preserved in their original distribution and intensity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
