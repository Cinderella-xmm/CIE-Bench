      "thinking_process": "The red and silver color scheme of Ultraman’s suit is a core identity feature of the character across all media. It is instantly recognizable and distinguishes him from other heroes. Changing it would make the figure unrecognizable as Ultraman, regardless of style. This is a 3-point element because it is fundamental to character identification.",
      "question": "Is Ultraman’s suit rendered in red and silver?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The yellow oval eye on the helmet and the blue gem on the chest are iconic symbols of Ultraman. These are not just accessories but key identifiers. Their absence or replacement would break the character’s visual identity. These are 3-point elements due to their unique role in recognition.",
      "question": "Does Ultraman have a yellow oval eye on his helmet and a blue gem on his chest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The monster’s bat-like wings and fanged mouth are defining features that establish its alien nature and threat level. These elements are essential for identifying it as the same creature from the original scene. Altering them beyond recognition would violate the continuity of the narrative. This is a 3-point element due to its role in enemy identification.",
      "question": "Does the monster have bat-like wings and a wide-open mouth with visible fangs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The metallic debris and ruined structure at the base serve as environmental context, indicating a battlefield. While the style may change, the presence of such debris is required by the instruction (“detailed with metallic debris”) and must be retained in form. Its removal would contradict the scene’s logic. This is a 2-point element because it’s crucial to the setting but not a character identifier.",
      "question": "Is there metallic debris or a ruined structure visible at the base of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The artist signature and date are part of the original artwork’s authenticity and provenance. While minor, their retention ensures fidelity to the source. The instruction does not mention removing them, so they must be preserved. This is a 1-point element due to its secondary importance.",
      "question": "Is the artist signature \"Arthur Adams 10-17-2020\" present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The MARVEL logo and title text are branding and narrative anchors. They define the work’s origin and name. Removing them would misrepresent the publication. These are 3-point elements because they are essential to the work’s identity.",
      "question": "Are the words \"MARVEL\", \"ULTRAMAN\", and \"THE TRIALS OF ULTRAMAN\" present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "Ultraman’s leaping forward pose is a dynamic element that conveys action and intent. Even in chibi form, the direction and posture must reflect this movement. Losing this would alter the narrative tension. This is a 2-point element because it defines the action but not the identity.",
      "question": "Is Ultraman depicted in a forward-leaping pose with one arm extended?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q8",
      "thinking_process": "The greenish-yellow organic background textures are part of the alien environment and contribute to the mood. Though stylized, their color and pattern should be retained to preserve visual consistency. This is a 1-point element as it supports atmosphere rather than identity.",
      "question": "Are the background textures primarily greenish-yellow with organic, ribbed patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
