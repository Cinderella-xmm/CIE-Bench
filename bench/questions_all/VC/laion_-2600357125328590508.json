      "thinking_process": "The vertical white \"Under Armour\" logo is the primary brand identifier on the sock. Its presence, orientation, and lettering style are critical for recognizing the product. If this logo is omitted, altered in spelling, or misaligned, the item would no longer be identifiable as an Under Armour sock. Therefore, preserving this exact logo in its original position and form is essential for core identity, assigning it a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the vertical white \"Under Armour\" logo clearly visible on the outer side of the calf, maintaining its original font, spacing, and orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The orange tag with the black Under Armour logo at the top cuff is a distinctive brand feature. Its color and placement are consistent across Under Armour products. Changing its color, removing it, or relocating it would compromise brand authenticity. Since the instruction specifies integrating an orange LEGO piece for the tag, its existence and position must be preserved. This is a key identification point, hence a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Is there an orange tag with a black Under Armour logo located at the top edge of the sock cuff?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The \"UA\" logo on the ankle is a secondary but recognizable brand mark. Its placement and stylized form are consistent with Under Armour's design language. While not as dominant as the full name, its absence would reduce brand coherence. Since the instruction does not mention changing this, and it is part of the original pattern, it must be retained. This is a key accessory element, thus weighted at 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the stylized \"UA\" logo present on the ankle section of the sock?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The color scheme—black base with gray and white geometric patterns—is integral to the sock’s design identity. The instruction specifies retaining the original patterns, which implies the color zones must remain unchanged. Altering the color distribution (e.g., swapping gray for blue) would break visual consistency. This is a major design element affecting recognition, so it receives a weight of 2 points.",
      "question": "Are the gray and white geometric patterns on the foot and shin area preserved in their original positions and color scheme?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The reinforced heel and toe areas are functional design features that also contribute to visual identity. Their shape and color (gray) distinguish them from the rest of the sock. Although not branded, they are part of the original pattern and help define the sock’s structure. The instruction requires retaining the original patterns, so these structural elements must be preserved. This is a detail-level but important consistency element, assigned 1 point.",
      "question": "Are the gray reinforced sections on the heel and toe maintained in their original shape and location?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The small text printed along the lower leg (likely product information) is a minor but present detail in the original image. While not central to brand identity, it contributes to the authenticity of the product representation. Since the instruction does not specify removing it and it is part of the original pattern, it should be preserved. This is a low-weight detail, so it receives 1 point.",
      "question": "Is the small text printed vertically along the lower leg of the sock still visible and in its original position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
