Description of reference image: The subject is a towering, rugged rock formation standing prominently in the foreground. It has a tall, narrow structure with uneven surfaces and visible cracks, giving it a textured appearance. The surrounding environment consists of rolling green hills that stretch into the distance, leading to a range of mountains under a partly cloudy sky. The lighting suggests either early morning or late afternoon, casting long shadows and highlighting the contours of the landscape.

Thinking process: First, analyze the instructions that clearly state what can be changed, such as transforming the rock formation into a creature inspired by its shape and textures. This allows for changes in the form and details of the rock while retaining its core characteristics. The instruction also specifies adding an orb or capsule near the creature's feet, which introduces new elements but does not alter the existing scene significantly. The name and elemental type are additional textual and thematic elements that do not affect the visual consistency of the original image.

Allowed Changes List:
Specific element 1 that allows for changes: Transforming the rock formation into a fantasy creature.
Specific element 2 that allows for changes: Adding an orb or capsule near the creature's feet.
Specific element 3 that allows for changes: Incorporating a name and elemental type for the creature.

Step 2- Determine the elements that should remain unchanged
Thinking process:
Core recognition elements: The iconic shape and texture of the rock formation must be retained to ensure the creature retains its earthy and rugged aesthetic. The rolling green hills and mountainous background contribute to the overall setting and should be preserved to maintain the environmental context. The lighting and shadow play are crucial for preserving the mood and atmosphere of the scene.

Functional/logical association elements: The position of the rock formation relative to the landscape needs to be maintained to preserve the logical relationship between the creature and its surroundings. The natural progression from the foreground hills to the distant mountains should remain intact.

Non modified element deduction: After excluding allowed changes, the remaining unmentioned details, such as the specific contours and coloration of the hills and mountains, need to be retained to ensure visual coherence.

Preservation Targets List:
(Element 1 that should be maintained): The distinctive shape and texture of the rock formation.
(Element 2 that should be maintained): The rolling green hills and mountainous background.
(Element 3 that should be maintained): The lighting and shadow effects on the landscape.

Q1: 
Thinking process: The distinctive shape and texture of the rock formation are key identifying elements. If these features are lost, the creature will lose its connection to the original subject. This is a core identity feature with a weight of 3 points.
Question: Does the creature retain the distinctive shape and texture of the original rock formation?
Choices: yes, no
A: yes
Weight: 3

Q2: 
Thinking process: The rolling green hills and mountainous background provide essential context for the scene. Losing this would disrupt the environmental setting. This is an important scene element with a weight of 2 points.
Question: Are the rolling green hills and mountainous background still present in the image?
Choices: yes, no
A: yes
Weight: 2

Q3: 
Thinking process: The lighting and shadow effects are crucial for maintaining the mood and atmosphere of the scene. These visual cues help ground the creature within its environment. This is an important scene element with a weight of 2 points.
Question: Are the lighting and shadow effects on the landscape retained?
Choices: yes, no
A: yes
Weight: 2

Q4: 
Thinking process: The specific contours and coloration of the hills and mountains contribute to the visual consistency of the scene. While not as critical as the core elements, they help maintain the overall look and feel. This is a detail-level element with a weight of 1 point.
Question: Do the contours and coloration of the hills and mountains remain consistent with the original image?
Choices: yes, no
A: yes
Weight: 1

Q5: 
Thinking process: The position of the rock formation relative to the landscape is important for maintaining the logical relationship between the creature and its surroundings. This is a functional/logical association element with a weight of 2 points.
Question: Is the position of the creature (original rock formation) relative to the landscape maintained?
Choices: yes, no
A: yes
Weight: 2
