      "thinking_process": "The face is the primary identifier of the individual in the original image. The shape of the eyes, the bridge and tip of the nose, the curvature of the lips, and the jawline are distinctive features that define her identity. If these are altered, the subject becomes unrecognizable. Even in a Renaissance reimagining, the face should remain consistent to preserve the subject's identity. This is a core identity feature, hence weight 3.",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the original woman’s facial features, including the shape of her eyes, nose, mouth, and jawline?",

      "thinking_process": "Skin tone is a fundamental biological trait that identifies the subject. Changing it would imply a different person or racial identity, which contradicts the intent of transforming appearance while retaining identity. It is a core recognition element, thus weight 3.",
      "question": "Is the original woman’s skin tone preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The walking posture — specifically the left leg forward and right arm bent — defines the dynamic movement in the image. Altering this would disrupt the sense of motion and balance. This is a key functional element related to the subject’s action, hence weight 2.",
      "question": "Does the edited image preserve the walking posture with the left leg forward and the right arm bent?",

      "thinking_process": "The hand positions are crucial for maintaining logical consistency in object interaction. The right hand is extended forward, holding a bag, and the left hand is near the hip. In the new version, she holds a fan, but the spatial placement of the hands should mirror the original to maintain naturalism. This is an important functional detail, hence weight 2.",
      "question": "Are the hand positions preserved, with the right hand extended forward and the left hand near the hip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The gaze direction — looking directly at the camera — is essential for maintaining emotional engagement and viewer connection. It is a key expressive element. Changing it would shift the mood and focus of the image. This is an important facial expression detail, hence weight 2.",
      "question": "Does the woman continue to look directly at the camera with the same gaze direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The body shape and proportions (slender frame, height, leg length) are critical for identifying the subject. Even with costume changes, these should remain consistent to avoid distortion. This is a secondary but important identification factor, hence weight 1.",
      "question": "Are the body shape and proportions of the woman preserved, including her slender frame and leg length?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The curl pattern and volume of the hair are distinctive features in the original image. Although the instruction allows replacement with a feathered cap, the original hair texture and style may be used as a base for transformation. However, since the instruction explicitly replaces the hat, the hair itself may be altered. But if the hair is present in the original, its general volume and curl pattern should be considered for consistency. This is a minor detail, hence weight 1.",
      "question": "Is the original volume and curl pattern of the woman’s hair preserved, even if partially obscured or styled differently?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
