      "thinking_process": "The upright posture with hind legs supporting the body and front paws clasped is a defining behavioral and anatomical feature of the squirrel in this image. It conveys alertness and is central to its expressive stance. Even in a transformed version, retaining this posture ensures continuity of character behavior and avoids misidentification as a different animal or pose. Loss of this would fundamentally alter the subject’s identity and action, making it unrecognizable as the same individual.",
      "question": "Is the squirrel standing upright on its hind legs with its front paws clasped together near the chest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The tail’s bushy, curved shape with a clear taper from base to tip is a key morphological identifier of squirrels. Its volume and direction contribute to species recognition. Even if color changes, the silhouette and structure must remain consistent to preserve biological accuracy and visual identity. Altering the tail’s form (e.g., flattening or shortening) would make it look like a different animal.",
      "question": "Does the squirrel have a large, bushy tail that curves upward and outward, extending above the back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The round ear shape with visible inner pink lining is a distinctive facial feature. This detail contributes to the squirrel’s realistic depiction and helps differentiate it from other rodents. Although the instruction allows color changes, the ear shape and internal structure are not mentioned as changeable. Preserving this maintains facial integrity and prevents confusion with other animals.",
      "question": "Are the ears of the squirrel rounded and positioned on top of the head, with a visible pink inner surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The large, dark circular eyes with clearly defined pupils are essential for expressing emotion and focus. They are prominent in the original image and serve as focal points. While glasses may be added, the underlying eye shape and placement must remain consistent to maintain facial structure. Changing their size or position would distort the face beyond recognition.",
      "question": "Are the eyes large, round, dark, and located symmetrically on either side of the face, with visible pupils?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The overall body proportion—specifically the head-to-body ratio and tail length relative to body—defines the squirrel’s silhouette. This proportional relationship is crucial for species identification. Even with stylization, maintaining this balance ensures the figure remains a plausible squirrel. Distorting these ratios could result in an alien or unrealistic form.",
      "question": "Is the head proportionally smaller than the body, with the tail approximately equal in length to the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
