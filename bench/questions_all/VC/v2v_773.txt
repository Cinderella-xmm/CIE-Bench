Description of reference image: The subject is a dried apple, cut in half vertically, with the interior exposed. The apple has a reddish-brown outer skin that shows signs of dehydration and slight wrinkling, particularly around the edges. The flesh inside is pale yellow to light brown, with a dry, fibrous texture and visible network-like patterns resembling veins or capillaries. At the center, there is a single dark brown seed embedded within a small cavity, surrounded by a thin, darker ring of tissue. The stem is short, thick, and dark brown, protruding from the top of the apple. The apple is positioned upright on a neutral, light gray surface with a matte finish, casting a soft shadow beneath it. The background is uniformly flat and featureless, providing no distractions from the subject.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions that clearly state what can be changed. The instruction says to "reimagine the dried apple from the photo as a collectible figure inspired by the One Piece anime universe," which means the form, function, and context of the apple are to be transformed entirely into a fictional character figurine. This implies that the original physical structure of the apple—its shape, texture, color, and internal anatomy—is not required to remain intact. The instruction specifies placing the figure in a collector’s box with accessories and displaying it out of packaging, indicating that the scene environment (the plain surface and background) is also not required to be preserved. However, the instruction does not mention altering any specific visual traits of the original apple beyond its transformation into a figurine. Therefore, while the overall form and setting are allowed to change, we must determine whether any intrinsic visual features of the original apple are implicitly tied to identity or logic and thus should be retained.

Allowed Changes List:
- The overall shape and form of the apple (transformed into a figurine)
- The material and texture of the apple (replaced with sculpted details of a collectible figure)
- The coloration of the apple (altered to match the aesthetic of One Piece characters)
- The internal structure (seed, core, flesh) — replaced with character anatomy
- The stem — reimagined as part of the figurine's design (e.g., hat, accessory)
- The background and surface — replaced with a display setup including a collector’s box and accessories
- The lighting and perspective — adjusted for an isometric view and professional rendering

Step 2 - Determine the elements that should remain unchanged  
Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements: The original apple is a real-world object with distinct biological features. While the instruction allows full transformation into a figurine, the key identifying visual elements of the original apple must still be traceable in the final design if the edit is faithful to the source. However, since the instruction explicitly calls for reimagination as a collectible figure, the core identity of the apple as a fruit is being replaced. Thus, no core biological identity features (like the seed or flesh pattern) are required to be preserved *as such*. But because the transformation is based on the original apple, certain iconic visual characteristics may serve as anchors for continuity. For example, the presence of a central seed cavity could be metaphorically preserved in the figurine’s design (e.g., a chest emblem), but this is speculative. Since the instruction does not require retention of any specific detail, only the general concept of the apple, we must infer that **no** biological features are mandated to be preserved in their original form.

Functional/logical association elements: There are no functional relationships in the original image (e.g., no interaction between objects). The apple stands alone, so no logical spatial or causal dependencies exist. Therefore, no functional elements need to be preserved.

Non-modified element deduction: After excluding all elements listed in the "Allowed Changes List," we consider whether any unmentioned visual details must be retained. The original image contains subtle textures: the wrinkled skin, the fibrous inner flesh, the dark seed, and the stem. These are all part of the apple’s appearance, but since the instruction permits complete reimagining, none of these are required to be preserved literally. However, if the edit is to be consistent with the original subject, some symbolic or structural cues might be expected. But again, the instruction does not specify preservation of any such cues.

Therefore, **no elements of the original image are required to be preserved**, as the transformation is total and explicit. The only constraint is that the new figure must be inspired by the apple, meaning the *concept* of the apple is retained, but not its visual form.

Preservation Targets List:  
(None)

Q1:  
Thinking process: The original apple has a distinct central seed located within a cavity at the core of the fruit. This seed is a key anatomical feature that defines the apple’s internal structure. Although the instruction allows transformation into a figurine, if the edit is to maintain a symbolic link to the original, the presence of a central element resembling a seed could be considered a core identifier. However, since the instruction does not require retention of any biological feature, and the figurine is to be inspired by the apple rather than derived from it, the seed itself is not a mandatory element. Nevertheless, for consistency, if the figurine includes a central motif (e.g., a heart-shaped emblem), it may be interpreted as a nod to the seed. But this is not guaranteed. Therefore, the question focuses on whether the seed is present in the original image, which it is, but its presence in the edited version is not required. Hence, this question tests whether the editor acknowledges the original feature, even if it is not preserved.

Question: Is there a single dark brown seed visible in the center of the apple's cross-section?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The apple’s flesh exhibits a network of fine lines and wrinkles, forming a web-like texture that is characteristic of dried fruit. This texture is a defining visual trait of the apple in its current state. While the instruction allows for artistic reinterpretation, if the figurine is to be “inspired” by the apple, one might expect some textural influence. However, since the instruction does not mandate preservation of texture, and the figurine will have sculpted surfaces, this detail is not required. Still, the question checks whether the original texture is recognized as a key feature.

Question: Does the apple’s flesh show a dry, fibrous texture with visible vein-like patterns?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The stem is a prominent feature of the apple, extending upward from the top. It is dark brown and slightly curved, with a rough texture. In the edited version, this could be reinterpreted as a hat or staff, but its presence as a vertical protrusion from the top of the apple is a key positional cue. Since the instruction does not require its preservation, but it is a distinctive part of the original, the question assesses whether this feature was noted.

Question: Is there a dark brown stem attached to the top of the apple?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The apple is cut in half vertically, revealing a symmetrical cross-section. This symmetry is a key compositional feature of the image. While the figurine may not be symmetrical, the original image’s symmetry is a notable visual trait. The instruction does not require symmetry in the figurine, so this is not a preservation target, but it is a distinguishing feature of the original.

Question: Is the apple sliced vertically, exposing a symmetrical cross-section?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The apple rests on a neutral, light gray surface with a matte finish. This background is minimal and uniform, serving to highlight the apple without distraction. The instruction specifies a new scene with a collector’s box and accessories, so the background is not preserved. However, the original surface is a key environmental element that defines the context of the image. Its absence in the edited version is expected, but the question confirms its presence in the original.

Question: Is the apple placed on a flat, light gray, matte surface?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Important Reminder  
Each question is based on a clear, observable visual feature present in the original image. None of the questions assume preservation of the feature in the edited version, as the instruction allows full transformation. The weight is assigned conservatively (1 point) because these are descriptive features of the original, not required to be retained. The questions are non-overlapping and focus on distinct aspects: seed, texture, stem, symmetry, and surface.
