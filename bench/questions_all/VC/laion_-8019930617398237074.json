      "thinking_process": "The lace pattern on the bodice and sleeves is a defining feature of the gown’s design. It distinguishes this dress from others and contributes significantly to its elegance and identity. Losing this detail would make the gown appear plain or generic, undermining its unique visual signature. Since the instruction mentions adding a \"pastel lace overlay,\" this implies the original lace must still be present beneath or alongside it, not replaced. Thus, the presence and structure of the original lace pattern must be retained.",

      "thinking_process": "The floral crown is a key accessory that identifies the subject as a bride and adds a romantic, natural element to her appearance. Its specific composition—light pink and cream flowers arranged in a circular band—is visually distinct. Even with stylization, the crown must remain recognizable as a floral headpiece in the same location and general form. Changing its type (e.g., to a tiara) or removing it would alter the subject’s identity.",

In this image, it is clearly visible as a translucent layer extending from behind her head. Though the instruction allows for artistic rendering, the veil’s presence and connection point must be preserved to maintain the bridal context. Removing or relocating it would disrupt the authenticity of the bridal look.",

It creates asymmetry and visual interest, distinguishing this gown from standard designs. Even if overlaid with new patterns, the original shape and flow of this panel must remain intact.

This shape is essential to identifying the dress type and maintaining its elegance. While the rendering may soften with watercolor, the overall outline must remain consistent. Changing the silhouette (e.g., to mermaid or ballgown) would fundamentally alter the dress’s identity.",

While the instruction allows watercolor effects in light pink and cream, the base color must remain predominantly white. Any significant deviation (e.g., shifting to off-white or ivory) could affect recognition, especially if contrasted against the added colors.
