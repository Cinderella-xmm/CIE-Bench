**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a translucent ice sculpture of a swan, positioned centrally in the foreground on a bed of snow. The swan has a gracefully curved neck with a smooth, polished surface that reflects ambient light, showing subtle gradients from white to golden-brown along the top of the neck and head. Its wings are sculpted with sharp, feather-like edges, giving a crystalline appearance, and its body is rounded and solid, resembling carved ice. The swan rests atop a circular base embedded in snow, surrounded by decorative elements: sprigs of evergreen pine branches with pink berry-like accents and a single white snowflake ornament placed near the base. In the background, blurred figures of people walk through a festive winter scene illuminated by colorful bokeh lights strung overhead—suggesting a holiday market or fair. Snowflakes gently fall throughout the scene, enhancing the wintry atmosphere. The lighting is soft and diffused, with warm glows emanating from the background lights reflecting off the ice.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction explicitly states the transformation of the **ice swan into a high-end winter fragrance bottle**, specifying modifications such as:
- Transforming the **wings into frosted glass accents**
- Converting the **neck into a sleek glass stopper**
- Incorporating **red, pink, green decorative elements** as part of the bottle’s design
- Adding an **iridescent logo** and labeling it **"Winter Glow"** in a festive font

These changes directly alter the **form and function** of the swan sculpture, indicating that the **overall structure and identity** of the object can be reimagined as a perfume bottle. However, the instruction does not mention altering the **background environment**, **snowy setting**, or **decorative elements like pine branches and snowflake** unless they are incorporated into the new design.

Key phrases indicating allowed changes:
- “Design the ice swan into a high-end winter fragrance bottle” → full transformation of the subject’s purpose and form
- “Transform the wings into frosted glass accents” → wings’ shape and material can change
- “Convert the neck into a sleek glass stopper” → neck’s function and shape may be modified
- “Incorporate red, pink, green decorative elements” → color palette and design motifs can be added/changed
- “Add an iridescent logo” and “name the fragrance 'Winter Glow'” → branding elements are newly introduced

However, no instruction says to remove or alter the **snow-covered ground**, **falling snow**, **festive lights**, or **people in the background**. Therefore, these environmental components are **not explicitly permitted for modification** and must be considered for retention unless contradicted.

Also, while the **swan's form** is being transformed, **certain visual features** may still need to be preserved if they are **core identifiers** of the original sculpture (e.g., position, orientation, base placement), even if the object itself is reimagined.

---

**Allowed Changes List:**
- The **shape and function** of the swan (from sculpture to fragrance bottle)
- The **material texture** of the wings (transformed into frosted glass)
- The **neck structure** (replaced with a glass stopper)
- The **color scheme** of decorative elements (incorporation of red, pink, green)
- The **addition of branding**: iridescent logo and "Winter Glow" label
- The **overall design style** of the object (now a luxury perfume bottle)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
We now apply exclusion based on the "Allowed Changes List" to determine what **must remain unchanged**.

### Core Recognition Elements:
- The **original subject** is an **ice swan sculpture**. While its form is being transformed into a perfume bottle, the **iconic shape** of the swan—its **curved neck**, **elegant posture**, and **position on snow**—is likely intended to be preserved in essence. Even though it becomes a bottle, the **visual silhouette** of a swan should remain recognizable.
- The **base location** and **placement on snow** are critical for spatial coherence. If the swan is moved or elevated without context, it loses grounding in the scene.
- The **surrounding decorative elements**—specifically the **evergreen sprigs with pink berries** and the **white snowflake**—are **visually distinct and tied to the original composition**. Since they are not mentioned for removal or alteration in the instructions, they should be retained unless integrated into the new design.
- The **snow-covered ground** and **falling snow particles** are essential to the **winter theme** and contribute to the **atmosphere**. They are not specified for change, so they must be preserved.
- The **background crowd and colored lights** provide **contextual depth** and **festival ambiance**. Their presence supports the **setting**, which is implied to remain intact (since no instruction says to replace or remove them).

### Functional/Logical Association Elements:
- The **relationship between the swan and the snow** is logical: it rests on it. This physical interaction must be preserved to maintain realism and continuity.
- The **position of the swan relative to the background** (centered in the foreground) should remain unchanged to preserve visual balance and narrative focus.

### Non-Modified Element Deduction:
- Any detail not listed in the "Allowed Changes" list must be assumed **retained**, especially if it contributes to **identity**, **coherence**, or **scene integrity**.
- For example, the **texture of the snow**, **orientation of the pine branches**, and **presence of the snowflake** are not mentioned for change, so they must be kept.
- The **lighting effect** (soft glow, bokeh lights) is not specified to be altered, so it should remain consistent.

Even though the **swan becomes a bottle**, the **core visual identity**—its **shape**, **position**, and **environmental integration**—should remain intact to ensure the edit feels coherent and faithful to the original scene.

---

**Preservation Targets List:**
- The **position of the swan/bottle on the snow-covered surface**
- The **presence of the pine sprigs with pink berry-like accents**
- The **white snowflake ornament near the base**
- The **snow-covered ground and falling snow particles**
- The **background crowd and colorful bokeh lights**
- The **overall layout and framing** (central subject, shallow depth of field)
- The **orientation of the swan’s neck** (gracefully curved, facing left)
- The **relative size and proportion** of the swan/bottle compared to the background figures

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The curved neck of the swan is a defining feature of its identity and posture. Even if transformed into a glass stopper, the **shape and curvature** must remain consistent to preserve recognition. The original swan has a long, elegant S-curve from head to body. This is a core identity element—without it, the object would not resemble a swan, undermining the thematic link. Therefore, the **curve of the neck** is a key visual anchor and must be preserved in form, even if material changes. This element is crucial for identification and carries a weight of 3 points.
    Question: Is the neck of the swan-shaped object still curved in an elegant S-shape, extending upward and backward from the body?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The **pink berry-like accents** on the pine sprigs are distinctive decorative elements in the original image. They are not standard greenery but have a specific **color and form** that contribute to the festive aesthetic. Since they are not mentioned for replacement in the instructions, their **presence and color** must be preserved. Changing them would disrupt the visual harmony and reduce fidelity to the original scene. These are important scene elements that help identify the winter holiday theme and thus carry a weight of 2 points.
    Question: Are the pink berry-like accents visible on the evergreen sprigs surrounding the base of the swan?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The **white snowflake ornament** is a unique, clearly defined object placed near the base of the swan. It is not just part of the snow but a separate decorative item. Its presence adds symbolic value and visual contrast. Since it is not referenced in the editing instruction, it must be retained. Removing it would diminish the festive detail and break consistency. It is a minor but identifiable detail, so it receives a weight of 1 point.
    Question: Is there a white snowflake-shaped ornament located near the base of the swan?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The **snow-covered ground** is a foundational element of the scene. It provides context and supports the swan sculpture. The texture and depth of the snow are visually significant. Since the instruction does not suggest removing or replacing it, and the swan is meant to rest on it, this surface must remain. Altering it would affect the realism and environmental logic. This is a key environmental element, hence a weight of 2 points.
    Question: Is the swan/bottle resting on a textured, snow-covered surface?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The **background crowd and colored bokeh lights** establish the festive, public winter setting. Their presence creates depth and atmosphere. The instruction does not specify changing the background, so it must be preserved. Removing or altering the lights would destroy the mood and context. This is a critical scene element for maintaining narrative coherence and emotional tone, thus receiving a weight of 2 points.
    Question: Are there blurred figures of people walking in the background under strings of colorful, glowing lights?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The **orientation of the swan’s head** (facing left) is a fixed pose in the original image. Even if transformed into a bottle, the **directionality** of the head should remain consistent to preserve visual continuity. A reversal or rotation would misalign with the original composition. This is a minor but directional detail that affects symmetry and framing, so it receives a weight of 1 point.
    Question: Is the head of the swan-shaped object oriented toward the left side of the image?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}
