### Step 1 - Allowed Changes List:
1. The athlete can be redrawn as an anime-style sports character, maintaining her current pose while enhancing her facial expression and adding light effects around her eyes.
2. The background can be modified to include energy glow effects, implying motion and dynamism.
3. The overall art style can shift to an anime aesthetic, including colors, shading, and line work typical for this genre.

### Step 2 - Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged:

Thinking process: 
Analyzing the core recognition elements: The tennis player's distinct pose, attire, and equipment (tennis racket) make up the core identity of the image. Altering these would disrupt the subject’s recognizability as a tennis athlete. The background signage ("Perrier") and the ball boy's presence contribute significantly to the context of a professional tennis match, thus maintaining them ensures the scene's integrity and logical consistency.

Analyzing functional/logical association elements: The tennis racket and its position relative to the player are crucial for understanding her action and intent. The ball boy’s posture and location add realism, indicating he is prepared to assist during the game, thus these should also be preserved.

Analyzing non-modified elements: The original scene elements like the court lines, the branding, and the ball boy’s placement should stay consistent to uphold visual coherence.

Preservation Targets List: 
(Element 1: Player's pose and stance)
(Element 2: Tennis racket and its position)
(Element 3: Ball boy's presence and posture)
(Element 4: Perrier branding and signage)
(Element 5: Court and line markings)
