      "thinking_process": "The relative positions of the three figures — left, center, right — form the core compositional structure of the image. If these positions are swapped or rearranged, the visual balance and narrative of the group are lost, making it unrecognizable as the same scene. This spatial layout is essential for identification and must be preserved.",
      "question": "Are the three figures positioned such that one is on the left, one in the center, and one on the right from the viewer's perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The central figure’s upright posture and full silhouette facing forward is a key identifier. Altering this stance (e.g., turning sideways or crouching) would disrupt the focal point of the image and misrepresent the original composition. This pose defines the dominant presence in the scene.",
      "question": "Is the central figure standing fully upright with both feet on the rock and facing forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The presence of the ocean in the background is a defining environmental feature. Removing or replacing it with land or fantasy terrain would violate the original coastal setting. The water’s presence is essential for establishing the \"coastline\" context required by the title.",
      "question": "Is the ocean visible in the background behind the figures, with waves breaking against rocks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The rocky foreground where the figures stand is a structural anchor of the image. Replacing it with flat ground or abstract platforms would destroy the sense of location and grounding. The irregular shape and texture of the rocks are necessary for continuity.",
      "question": "Are the figures standing on dark, jagged rock formations in the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The sun’s placement behind the central figure creates a distinctive backlighting effect and lens flare. Moving the sun to another position or removing it would eliminate the primary light source and symbolic glow, altering the emotional tone and visual focus of the image.",
      "question": "Is the sun positioned directly behind the central figure, creating a bright glow between his legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The horizon line separates the sky and sea and provides spatial orientation. Its absence or distortion would make the scene feel disoriented or unreal. It is a foundational element of landscape composition.",
      "question": "Is there a clear horizon line separating the sky from the ocean in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The silhouette of the figure on the right (with long hair and glasses) is visually distinct due to the combination of long hair and glasses. While details may be altered, the general shape of the head and hair must remain recognizable to preserve individual identity within the group.",
      "question": "Does the figure on the right have long, wavy hair extending past the shoulders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "thinking_process": "The figure on the left has curly, shoulder-length hair that is visibly different from the others. Retaining this hair type helps distinguish the characters even after transformation. It is a minor but identifiable detail.",
      "question": "Does the figure on the left have curly, light brown hair reaching past the shoulders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
