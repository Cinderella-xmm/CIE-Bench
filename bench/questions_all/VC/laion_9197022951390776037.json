      "thinking_process": "The word \"SCARECROW\" is the brand name and the primary identifier of the product. Its presence and legibility are essential for brand recognition. Even if stylized in a fantasy context, it must remain readable and positioned centrally on the label. If lost or obscured, the product cannot be identified as Scarecrow wine. Therefore, this is a core identity element with a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the word \"SCARECROW\" clearly visible and legible on the label?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The year \"2017\" is a key vintage indicator. It must remain visible to maintain product authenticity and historical context. Even if integrated into the fantasy design (e.g., floating near the face or etched on a vine), it must be present and readable. Losing it would remove important product information and affect coherence with the original image. Thus, it is an important detail with a weight of 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the year \"2017\" visible somewhere on the bottle or label?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The scarecrow icon is the iconic symbol of the brand. Although the instruction says to convert it into a face expressing curiosity, it must still retain core scarecrow features such as a straw hat and rustic appearance. If transformed into a generic cartoon face without these traits, the brand identity is lost. This is a core recognition element, hence a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Does the icon at the top of the label, now transformed into a face, retain the shape of a straw hat and rustic features consistent with a scarecrow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The label must remain a central rectangular element on the bottle’s front to maintain the structure of a wine bottle. Even if vines wrap around it or eyes are added, the label’s basic shape and position must be preserved. Removing or distorting it would break the logical relationship between the product and its packaging. This is a functional element, so it has a weight of 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the label still a rectangular shape positioned centrally on the front of the bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The bottle must remain upright to preserve its identity as a wine bottle. Tilting or lying down would disrupt the expected form and could mislead viewers about the product type. This is a fundamental posture requirement, so it is a key structural element with a weight of 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the bottle oriented vertically, standing upright?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The label’s position on the bottle must be centered vertically to match the original design. Deviation would make the label appear off-center, affecting visual balance and brand consistency. While minor shifts might be acceptable, the core alignment must be preserved. This is a detail-level element, so it has a weight of 1 point.",
      "question": "Is the label positioned exactly in the center of the bottle’s height?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
