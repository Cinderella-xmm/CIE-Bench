      "thinking_process": "The pomegranate is a core symbolic and compositional element in the original painting. Its distinct shape—round, red exterior with visible internal seeds—and partially opened state are essential to its identity. Even with added gloss, the fruit must remain recognizable as a pomegranate. This is a key identifier of the subject’s interaction and thematic content, and losing it would fundamentally alter the image’s meaning. Thus, it is assigned 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the pomegranate present and clearly identifiable as a red, round fruit with visible internal seeds, held in the hands?",

      "thinking_process": "The headscarf’s color and pattern—golden-yellow with diagonal stripes in purple, blue, and red—are iconic visual features that define the subject’s appearance. These stripes are not arbitrary; they contribute to the cultural and aesthetic identity of the figure. Although the instruction allows for vividness and enhancement, the basic color scheme and striped structure must remain intact for recognition. Loss of these would make the figure unrecognizable. Therefore, this is a high-weight element.",
      "question": "Does the headscarf retain its golden-yellow base color with diagonal stripes in purple, blue, and red?",

      "thinking_process": "The ornate earring is a unique accessory with specific components: silver framework, red gemstone, and dangling elements. Its presence contributes to the subject’s cultural and decorative identity. Even in a stylized version, the earring’s structure must remain identifiable. Removing or altering it significantly would break the visual continuity. Hence, it is critical and assigned 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the left ear adorned with a silver earring featuring a red gemstone and dangling components?",

      "thinking_process": "The brown vest with blue embroidery along the collar and shoulder is a key clothing detail that distinguishes the subject’s attire. The blue stitching is not random—it follows a specific pattern that adds visual interest and cultural context. While patterns may be exaggerated, the base design must remain recognizable. This is an important identifying feature, thus assigned 2 points.",
      "question": "Does the brown outer vest have blue embroidered detailing along the collar and shoulder seams?",

      "thinking_process": "The hands holding the pomegranate represent a functional and compositional anchor. The grip is natural and deliberate, connecting the figure to the symbolic fruit. In any transformation, the act of holding must be preserved to maintain narrative logic. Even in chibi form, the hands must be shown grasping the fruit. This is a crucial action-based element, so it receives 2 points.",
      "question": "Are both hands visibly positioned around the pomegranate, showing a clear grip?",

      "thinking_process": "The silver bracelet on the right wrist is a minor but consistent detail that adds to the subject’s adornment. While it may shrink in scale due to chibi proportions, its presence as a metallic band must be retained. Its absence would be a noticeable omission in detail fidelity. It is a secondary but coherent element, hence assigned 1 point.",

      "thinking_process": "The inner robe’s off-white color is a foundational element of the attire. While texture may be simplified, the base color must remain distinguishable to preserve the clothing hierarchy and contrast with the darker vest. This is a detail-level element that supports visual coherence, so it receives 1 point.",
      "question": "Is the inner garment under the vest primarily off-white in color?",
