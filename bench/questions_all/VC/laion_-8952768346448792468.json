      "thinking_process": "The platinum blonde hair is the most iconic feature of Daenerys Targaryen, especially its specific shade and braided structure. Its presence and texture are essential for character recognition. Even under a Renaissance transformation, the hair must retain its original color and style to preserve identity. This is a core identity feature, and its loss would make the subject unrecognizable.",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the platinum blonde hair with visible waves and braided sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The facial structure—particularly the defined jawline, high cheekbones, and eye shape—is a key biometric identifier of the subject. These features are not mentioned in the editing instruction as being altered, and changing them would fundamentally transform the character’s identity. Therefore, they must be preserved as core recognition elements.",
      "question": "Are the facial features, including the jawline and eye shape, accurately preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The subject’s pose—standing upright with a slight bow of the head and hands clasped in front—creates a specific emotional tone and narrative stance. This posture is central to the scene’s mood and must be maintained to preserve the intended emotional weight. Although clothing and surroundings may change, this body language defines the character’s presence.",
      "question": "Is the subject depicted in a standing position with a slightly bowed head and hands clasped in front of the waist?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The dagger held vertically in the subject’s hands is a functional object tied to her agency and narrative role. While its design may be stylized in the Renaissance version, its presence and orientation must be preserved to maintain continuity in the action logic. Removing or repositioning it would disrupt the scene’s narrative integrity.",
      "question": "Is a dagger present in the subject’s hands, held vertically with both hands clasping it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The subject’s central placement between two symmetrical lines of figures is a key compositional element that establishes balance and focus. While the figures behind her will be transformed into courtiers, their arrangement must still mirror the original symmetry to preserve the visual structure. This spatial logic supports the original scene’s dramatic framing.",
      "question": "Is the subject positioned centrally between two parallel lines of figures extending into the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
