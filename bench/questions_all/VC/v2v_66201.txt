### Step 1 - Description of Reference Image and Allowed Changes List

**Description of Reference Image:**  
The subject is a scholarly monkey dressed in a detailed Victorian-style outfit, including a jacket, vest, and tie. The monkey has a serious expression, with its tail extending upwards and to the right. The background features a cosmic scene with a spiral galaxy and scattered stars. In the foreground, there is a brass scientific instrument with a wheel and a cylindrical component, placed on a wooden surface.

**Thinking Process:**  
The editing instructions specify transforming the fabric of the Victorian attire into cosmic dust, integrating the brass instrument with organic clockwork tendrils, and subtly distorting the monkey's hands. The instructions do not mention altering the monkey's face, the galaxy background, or the overall posture.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
1. The fabric of the Victorian attire can dissolve into cosmic dust.
2. The brass scientific instrument can grow organic clockwork tendrils.
3. The monkey's hands can be subtly distorted.

### Step 2 - Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged

**Thinking Process:**  
- **Core Recognition Elements:** The monkey's face, the spiral galaxy background, and the overall posture are crucial for recognizing the subject and setting. Changing these would lose the identity of the image.
- **Functional/Logical Association Elements:** The placement of the brass instrument and the monkey's interaction with it must be logically consistent. The instrument's position relative to the monkey should remain intact.
- **Remaining Elements:** The monkey's tail, the wooden surface, and the general color scheme should be retained for visual coherence.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
1. The monkey's face and expression.
2. The spiral galaxy background.
3. The monkey's overall posture.
4. The position of the brass instrument relative to the monkey.
5. The monkey's tail and the wooden surface.

### Step 3 - Generate Yes/No Questions

**Q1:**  
Thinking process: The monkey's face is a core recognition feature. Any distortion here would make the subject unrecognizable, hence it carries a high weight.
Question: Is the monkey's face and expression clearly visible and undistorted?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

**Q2:**  
Thinking process: The spiral galaxy is an iconic background element that sets the scene. Losing this would significantly alter the image's atmosphere.
Question: Does the background still feature a spiral galaxy with stars?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

**Q3:**  
Thinking process: The monkey's posture is essential for maintaining the composition and balance of the image.
Question: Is the monkey's overall posture, including the upward extension of its tail, retained?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

**Q4:**  
Thinking process: The position of the brass instrument is functionally linked to the monkey's interaction with it.
Question: Is the brass scientific instrument still positioned on the wooden surface near the monkey?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

**Q5:**  
Thinking process: The wooden surface provides context and grounding for the scene.
Question: Is the wooden surface beneath the brass instrument still present?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1
