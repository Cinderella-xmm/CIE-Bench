Description of reference image: The subject of the image is a baby elephant standing in an enclosure. The elephant has a wrinkled gray skin texture, small ears relative to its body size, and a short trunk, all of which are characteristic of a young elephant. The background includes vertical blue metal bars, a stack of hay to the right, and a ground covered with reddish dirt. The elephant is positioned near the bars, facing slightly towards the camera.

### Step 1 - Allowed Changes List:

Thinking process: The given instructions aim to transform the food ingredients into a Michelin-style plating. However, since this image does not contain food, the instructions would not apply directly. Nonetheless, interpreting the intent, we can infer changes could involve altering the scene completely to depict the plating scenario described. Therefore, we can consider changing the baby elephant, the environment, and other unrelated elements.

Allowed Changes List:
1. Replace the baby elephant with a Michelin-style dish, such as a spiral-rolled steak with fan-shaped carrots.
2. Modify the environment to include a white ceramic plate, sauce dots, and other culinary elements.
3. Adjust lighting and colors for a fine dining presentation aesthetic.

### Step 2 - Preservation Targets List:

Thinking process:
The core recognition elements here would relate to the baby elephantâ€™s unique characteristics, which are essential for identifying it as a young elephant. Functional/logical association elements, such as the positioning near the bars, signify enclosure settings. Remaining elements, like the specific background and ground texture, contribute to context but not core identity.

Preservation Targets List:
1. The baby elephant's wrinkled gray skin texture.
2. The baby elephant's small ears relative to body size.
3. The baby elephant's short trunk.
4. The vertical blue metal bars indicating an enclosure setting.
5. The reddish dirt ground texture.
