### Step 1 - Description of Reference Image:
The subject is a person performing a martial arts pose, dressed in a black outfit consisting of a loose-fitting black shirt and matching black pants. The individual has their hair tied up neatly in a bun. Their posture is dynamic, with one leg extended forward and the other bent behind, while both arms are raised in a balanced manner, palms facing outward. The background is plain and neutral, providing no distractions from the subject.

### Thinking Process:
The instructions specify transforming the subject into a 3D chibi character, which means the subject's form can be stylized and simplified. However, the pose and clothing details must be accurately replicated. The scene is to be replaced with an Instagram frame setting, indicating that the original background can be changed. The instructions also mention positioning the character playfully and including social media elements, which are new additions not present in the original image.

### Allowed Changes List:
- Subject's form can be transformed into a 3D chibi style.
- The background can be replaced with an Instagram frame setting.
- Additional elements like the username "Graceful" and social media icons can be added.

### Step 2 - Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged:

#### Thinking Process:
**Core Recognition Elements:** The martial arts pose and black outfit are key identifiers of the subject. Changing these would alter the core identity of the character. The pose, including the stance and arm positions, is crucial for maintaining the martial arts theme.

**Functional/Logical Association Elements:** The relationship between the clothing and the pose must be preserved. The clothing should still appear as if it fits the chibi character in the same way it fits the original subject.

**Remaining Elements:** Details like the neat bun hairstyle and the simplicity of the black outfit contribute to the visual coherence and should be retained.

#### Preservation Targets List:
- The martial arts pose (stance and arm positions).
- The black outfit (shirt and pants).
- The neat bun hairstyle.
