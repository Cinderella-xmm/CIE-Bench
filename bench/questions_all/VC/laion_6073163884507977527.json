      "thinking_process": "The two-tiered roof with its specific color contrast—reddish-brown lower section and dark, rough-textured upper section—is a defining architectural feature of the house. Its shape and material texture are crucial for identifying the model as a rustic, weathered structure. Altering this would fundamentally change the identity of the building. This is a core recognition element, hence weighted at 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the two-tiered roof structure with a reddish-brown lower section and a dark, rough-textured upper section still present?",

      "thinking_process": "The arched green door is a central functional and visual feature of the house. It is positioned at the front center and serves as the primary entry point. The instruction specifies that a bridge leads to the entrance, which implies the door's position must remain unchanged. Removing or relocating it would break the logical connection between the bridge and the house, undermining scene coherence. This is a critical functional and identity element, thus weighted at 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the arched green door located at the front center of the house?",

      "thinking_process": "The oval-shaped window above the door and the rectangular window to its left are distinctive openings that contribute to the facial-like symmetry of the house. Their shapes and positions are unique identifiers of the model’s design. Changing them would make the house unrecognizable. These are key architectural details necessary for identity preservation, so they are assigned 2 points due to their importance but slightly less than the main door or roof.",
      "question": "Are the oval-shaped window above the door and the rectangular window to its left still present in their original positions?",

      "thinking_process": "The partially ruined right wall with exposed brickwork is a signature detail indicating decay and age. It distinguishes this model from intact buildings and contributes to its rustic charm. Since the instruction does not mention modifying this feature, it must be preserved. Loss of this element would remove a major visual identifier, making the model appear different. This is a key detail element, so it is weighted at 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the partially ruined right wall with exposed brickwork still visible?",

      "thinking_process": "The rust-colored tree with dense foliage on the left side is a prominent environmental feature that anchors the composition. It provides seasonal context and visual balance. The instruction allows adding new trees with fairy lights, but does not specify replacing this one. Therefore, its presence and appearance must be preserved. This is a significant landscape element, so it is given 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the rust-colored tree with dense foliage located on the left side of the house still present?",

      "thinking_process": "The low red brick wall next to the tree is a minor but identifiable structural element that adds depth and context to the scene. It helps define the boundary of the property and complements the tree. While not central, its absence would reduce visual fidelity. It is a secondary detail that supports coherence, so it is assigned 1 point.",
      "question": "Is the low red brick wall adjacent to the rust-colored tree still present?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The steps leading up to the entrance are a functional pathway that connects the ground level to the door. They are essential for maintaining the spatial logic of access to the house. The instruction mentions a bridge leading to the entrance, implying the steps may be replaced or supplemented, but since no explicit removal is stated, their existence must be assumed unless overridden. However, if the bridge replaces them entirely, this could be a permissible change. But since the instruction says \"leading to the entrance,\" not \"replacing the steps,\" the steps may still be present. To ensure consistency, we treat this as a minor but important layout element. Weighted at 1 point.",

      "thinking_process": "The green moss-like vegetation near the base of the house and along the steps is a key textural detail that enhances realism. It is part of the original ground cover and contributes to the naturalistic setting. The instruction allows adding more vegetation, but does not require removing existing moss. Therefore, its presence must be preserved. This is a detail-level element affecting visual coherence, so it is assigned 1 point.",
      "question": "Are patches of green moss-like vegetation visible near the base of the house and along the steps?",
