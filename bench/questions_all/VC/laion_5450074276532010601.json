      "thinking_process": "The \"Schildkröt\" brand name is a core identity feature of the product. It appears prominently on the ball box and faintly on the paddle surface. Removing or altering this text would misidentify the product and undermine brand recognition. This is a key element because it directly identifies the manufacturer and distinguishes this set from others. Its presence is essential for accurate product identification.",
      "question": "Is the \"Schildkröt\" brand name visible on the ball box and/or paddle surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The red and blue rubber surfaces of the paddles are distinctive functional features that define their use in table tennis. They are visually unique and help identify the paddles as standard equipment. Even if stylized into cartoon characters, the red and blue coloration must remain to maintain the connection to real-world table tennis gear. Their absence would make the paddles unrecognizable as such.",
      "question": "Are the paddles clearly depicted with one red rubber surface and one blue rubber surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The diamond-shaped logo on the paddle handles is a signature brand detail. It is a small but identifiable mark that links the paddles to the Schildkröt brand. If omitted or altered, the authenticity of the product representation is compromised. This logo is a secondary but important identifier that contributes to brand consistency.",
      "question": "Is there a diamond-shaped logo present on the handle of each paddle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The presence of two paddles is a fundamental aspect of a standard table tennis set. The quantity is essential for gameplay and product classification. Changing the number would alter the functional identity of the set. Even in a whimsical narrative, the count must remain two to reflect reality.",
      "question": "Are exactly two paddles included in the set?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "thinking_process": "The rope handle on the left side of the box is a physical feature that enables portability. It is a tangible detail that defines the box’s usability. While the box may be transformed into a treasure chest, the handle must still exist in a similar location and form to preserve the original functional design.",
      "question": "Is a rope handle visibly attached to the left side of the box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The internal partitioned compartment structure is a key design feature that secures the paddles in place. It reflects the practical engineering of the storage solution. Although the compartment may be stylized, its existence and function must remain intact to preserve the logical organization of the set.",
      "question": "Is there a horizontal partition inside the box that separates and holds the paddles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The rectangular shape and hinged lid mechanism are core structural features of the box. They define its form as a portable case. Even if transformed into a treasure chest, the basic shape and opening method must remain recognizable to maintain continuity with the original object.",
      "question": "Does the box have a rectangular shape with a hinged lid that opens upward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
