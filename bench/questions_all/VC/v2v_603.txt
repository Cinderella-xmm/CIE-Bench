### Description of Reference Image:
The image depicts two individuals skiing through a dense, foggy forest covered in snow. Both skiers are equipped with ski poles and skis, wearing winter clothing—red and blue jackets respectively—and carrying black backpacks. The trees are tall and heavily laden with snow, creating a serene yet mysterious atmosphere. The skiers are positioned side by side, facing away from the camera, moving forward into the misty forest.

### Thinking Process:
The editing instructions specify transforming the skiers into 3D chibi-style characters while retaining their outfits, backpacks, and skiing gear. The snowy forest setting and the original arrangement of the environment must also be preserved. Therefore, the core recognition elements include the skiers' attire, equipment, and the forest backdrop. Functional/logical elements involve the skiers' postures and the positioning of their gear. Remaining elements, such as the snow-covered trees and foggy atmosphere, contribute to visual coherence.

#### Allowed Changes List:
- The physical form of the skiers can be changed to a 3D chibi style.
- The proportions of the skiers can be adjusted to fit the chibi aesthetic.

#### Preservation Targets List:
- The skiers' outfits (red and blue jackets, pants, gloves, boots).
- The skiing gear (skis, poles, backpacks).
- The snowy forest setting (snow-covered trees, foggy atmosphere).
- The skiers' postures and arrangement (side by side, facing forward).
