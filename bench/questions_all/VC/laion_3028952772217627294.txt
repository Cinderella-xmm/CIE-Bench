**Description of reference image:**  
The subject consists of two hand-crocheted amigurumi toys: a green cactus wearing a colorful sombrero and a gray donkey with a striped saddle pattern. The cactus is seated in a crocheted terracotta-style pot decorated with turquoise and pink geometric patterns, topped with a yellow star. It has black button eyes, rosy cheeks, a red smiling mouth, and two red pom-pom arms raised upward. The sombrero features horizontal stripes in purple, pink, light blue, and orange. The donkey is gray with a white muzzle, black eyes, black hooves, and a black mane and tail; its body displays vibrant vertical stripes in orange, pink, purple, and teal across the back. Both figures are positioned on a plain white surface with scattered yellow shredded paper (resembling hay) and wooden spice tags labeled "Basil," "Rouge," and "Parsley" partially visible in the foreground. The lighting is even and soft, emphasizing the texture of the crochet stitches.

**Step 1 – Determine allowed changes**

Thinking process:  
The editing instruction specifies transforming the cactus into a **3D plush doll mockup** with **visible detailed stitches**, implying that while the form remains similar, the texture and presentation may be enhanced or stylized. Similarly, the donkey is to become a **realistic plush prototype**, suggesting a shift in material rendering—more lifelike but still based on the original design. The instruction explicitly requires **incorporating festive Mexican motifs** and **child-friendly fonts** within a **colorful packaging box** labeled “Knitted Amigos.” This indicates that the background scene (white surface, hay, spice tags) is not required to be preserved, as it will be replaced by a new branded package. The transformation of both characters into plush prototypes implies changes in **texture detail**, **material appearance**, and **presentation context**, but their **core identities**—cactus with sombrero, donkey with striped saddle—must remain recognizable. However, **specific textures like the stitch pattern** are now emphasized as a feature to highlight rather than just present.

Allowed Changes List:  
- Background environment (white surface, hay, spice tags)  
- Presentation context (from isolated display to inside a branded box)  
- Texture style of the plush toys (e.g., enhancing visibility of stitches, increasing realism)  
- Material appearance (e.g., simulating fabric softness, depth of plush)  
- Font style and branding elements (e.g., "Knitted Amigos" label, child-friendly typography)  
- Addition of festive Mexican motifs (e.g., maracas, piñata patterns) in packaging

**Step 2 – Determine elements that should remain unchanged**

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements must preserve what makes each character uniquely identifiable. For the cactus: the **green color**, **sombrero with multicolored stripes**, **pom-pom arms**, **rosy cheeks**, and **star on the pot** are essential identifiers. Removing any would compromise its identity as the specific whimsical cactus character. For the donkey: the **gray body**, **white muzzle**, **black hooves**, **black mane/tail**, and **vibrant striped saddle pattern** are key visual traits. These define its appearance and distinguish it from other animals. Functional/logical associations include the **position of the sombrero on the cactus’s head** and the **placement of the striped pattern along the donkey’s back**—these are structural and symbolic features tied to identity. Non-modified elements include **the shape of the cactus**, **the pot’s form**, **the donkey’s posture**, and **the color palette** of the stripes, which must remain consistent to maintain visual coherence. Even though the texture may be altered, the **presence and configuration of stitches** must be retained as a core aesthetic trait of the knitted origin. The **yellow star** on the pot is a unique decorative element that must persist to retain brand consistency.

Preservation Targets List:  
- Green color of the cactus  
- Multicolored striped sombrero (purple, pink, light blue, orange)  
- Red pom-pom arms  
- Rosy cheeks and red smile on the cactus  
- Yellow star on the pot  
- Gray body of the donkey  
- White muzzle and black hooves  
- Black mane and tail  
- Vertical striped saddle pattern (orange, pink, purple, teal)  
- Position of the donkey’s ears and facial features  
- Shape of the cactus and pot  
- Color and placement of the star

    Q1:  
    Thinking process: The green color of the cactus is its primary identity feature, distinguishing it from other plant types and making it instantly recognizable as the central character. Changing this color would fundamentally alter its identity and break continuity with the original design. As the base color of the figure, it is a core visual anchor.  
    Question: Is the cactus rendered in green?  
    Choices: Yes, No  
    A: Yes  
    Weight: 3  
}

{
    Q2:  
    Thinking process: The sombrero with its specific stripe pattern (purple, pink, light blue, orange) is an iconic accessory defining the cactus's cultural and stylistic identity. Its absence or alteration would remove a key visual signature. The pattern is not generic but distinct, so retention is critical for recognition.  
    Question: Does the cactus wear a sombrero with horizontal stripes in purple, pink, light blue, and orange?  
    Choices: Yes, No  
    A: Yes  
    Weight: 3  
}

{
    Q3:  
    Thinking process: The red pom-pom arms are a distinctive feature indicating the cactus's playful, anthropomorphic nature. They are functional extensions of the character’s expression and are visually prominent. Their removal would reduce expressiveness and alter the character’s personality.  
    Question: Are there two red pom-poms attached to the cactus's arms?  
    Choices: Yes, No  
    A: Yes  
    Weight: 2  
}

{
    Q4:  
    Thinking process: The yellow star on the pot is a unique decorative element that adds charm and serves as a secondary identifier. It is not common in typical pots and helps distinguish this toy from others. Its presence contributes to the overall whimsical theme.  
    Question: Is there a yellow star affixed to the side of the cactus's pot?  
    Choices: Yes, No  
    A: Yes  
    Weight: 2  
}

{
    Q5:  
    Thinking process: The donkey’s striped saddle pattern (orange, pink, purple, teal) is a key design element that gives it visual vibrancy and cultural flair. It is not random but follows a consistent sequence. Altering the colors or pattern would disrupt its identity and thematic cohesion.  
    Question: Does the donkey have vertical stripes in orange, pink, purple, and teal along its back?  
    Choices: Yes, No  
    A: Yes  
    Weight: 3  
}

{
    Q6:  
    Thinking process: The black hooves are a defining anatomical feature of the donkey, contrasting with its gray body and reinforcing its realistic animal form. Their absence would make the legs appear incomplete or unnatural, affecting structural integrity.  
    Question: Do the donkey’s feet end in black hooves?  
    Choices: Yes, No  
    A: Yes  
    Weight: 2  
}

{
    Q7:  
    Thinking process: The white muzzle is a crucial facial feature that separates the donkey’s face from its body and provides contrast for facial details. Without it, the donkey would lose its characteristic expression and appear less expressive.  
    Question: Is the donkey’s muzzle white?  
    Choices: Yes, No  
    A: Yes  
    Weight: 2  
}

{
    Q8:  
    Thinking process: The black mane and tail are essential for defining the donkey’s species-specific appearance. They provide contrast and contribute to the animal’s silhouette and movement cues. Their removal would make the donkey look unnatural or incomplete.  
    Question: Does the donkey have a black mane and tail?  
    Choices: Yes, No  
    A: Yes  
    Weight: 2
