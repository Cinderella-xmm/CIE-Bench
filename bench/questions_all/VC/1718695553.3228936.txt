Description of reference image: The subject is a knitted plush hippopotamus wearing a tiger-striped patterned outfit, featuring orange and black stripes across its body, limbs, and head. The hippo has light gray skin on its face, belly, and limbs, with small rounded ears and large, expressive dark eyes. It is positioned on a sandy beach at sunset, leaning forward slightly while interacting with a knitted beach ball that has bold red, yellow, and white horizontal stripes. The ball rests in front of the hippo, partially under its right forelimb. The background shows a soft-focus ocean horizon with gentle waves and a warm gradient sky transitioning from pink to golden hues near the horizon. The lighting suggests late afternoon or early evening, casting long shadows on the sand. The texture of both the hippo and the ball appears soft and hand-knitted, with visible stitch patterns and slight irregularities typical of textile crafts.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions word by word to determine what can be changed. The instruction explicitly states to “replace the sandy beach with a flat white studio background,” indicating the scene is fully replaceable. It also specifies transforming the plush hippo and beach ball into a "professional merchandise mockup," which implies changes to presentation context but not necessarily the core identity of the objects. However, it does not say to alter the form, color, or pattern of the hippo or ball—only to add branding elements like a logo tag, embroidered patch, packaging box, and text. Therefore, the original textures, colors, and forms of the hippo and ball are implied to remain intact as the base for modification. The instruction allows changing the environment entirely, so the beach, ocean, and sky are not required to be preserved. Elements like the brand logo, packaging, and text are new additions and not part of the original image. Thus, only the original visual features of the hippo and ball that are not mentioned for alteration must be retained.

Allowed Changes List:
- Background (sandy beach, ocean, sky) → replaced with flat white studio background
- Scene lighting and atmosphere → changed to studio lighting
- Addition of brand logo tag stitched on ear
- Addition of circular embroidered brand patch on side
- Addition of packaging box with pastel wave motif and seashell illustrations
- Addition of transparent plastic window on box front
- Addition of text reading "Summer Pals Collection" in child-friendly font

Step 2 - Determine the elements that should remain unchanged  
Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements: The hippo's identity as a knitted plush toy in tiger stripes is central. Its form—specifically the hippo shape with rounded body, short legs, large snout, and small ears—is essential for identification. The tiger stripe pattern (orange with black stripes) is a key visual identifier, especially since it’s applied to a non-tiger animal, making the contrast a defining feature. The beach ball’s striped pattern (red, yellow, white) and knitted texture are also unique identifiers. These patterns are not just decorative—they define the product’s aesthetic and function as a children’s toy. Changing them would fundamentally alter the object’s identity.

Functional/logical association elements: The interaction between the hippo and the ball—where the hippo leans over it, suggesting playfulness—is logically tied to the toy’s purpose. This posture supports the narrative of a playful character engaging with a ball, which is critical for conveying the intended use. Even if the background changes, this action relationship should be preserved to maintain functional coherence.

Non-modified element deduction: After excluding allowed changes (background, added branding, packaging), the remaining unmentioned details include the exact placement of the stripes, the knit texture, the facial expression (soft smile, wide eyes), the position of the tail, and the relative size and shape of the ball. These were not mentioned for change and are integral to the original design. While not core, they contribute to visual consistency and authenticity of the craft style.

Preservation Targets List:  
- The knitted texture of the hippo’s body, including visible stitches and fabric imperfections  
- The orange and black tiger stripe pattern covering the hippo’s back, legs, and head  
- The light gray coloration of the hippo’s face, belly, and limbs  
- The red, yellow, and white striped pattern of the knitted beach ball  
- The posture of the hippo leaning forward toward the ball  
- The round shape and size ratio of the beach ball relative to the hippo  
- The facial features: large dark eyes, small smile, and rounded ears

    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The orange and black tiger stripe pattern is the most distinctive visual feature of the hippo, distinguishing it from a regular plush hippo and giving it thematic identity. The pattern’s specific color scheme (orange with black stripes) and distribution across the body are core to its recognition as a “tiger-stripe hippo.” Any deviation would make the object unrecognizable as the original concept. This is a key identity element.
    Question: Is the orange and black tiger stripe pattern present on the hippo’s body, head, and limbs?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The knitted texture is a defining characteristic of the toy, indicating handmade craftsmanship and material quality. The visible stitches and slight irregularities in the fabric surface are essential for identifying it as a knitted item rather than a smooth plastic or fabric toy. Losing this texture would change the perceived nature of the product.
    Question: Is the visible knitted texture with distinct stitches present on the hippo’s body and the beach ball?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The light gray coloration of the hippo’s face, belly, and limbs contrasts with the striped areas and is crucial for maintaining the correct species representation (hippo) beneath the costume. Changing this color would misrepresent the animal and disrupt the visual balance of the design.
    Question: Are the face, belly, and limbs of the hippo rendered in light gray color?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The red, yellow, and white striped pattern of the beach ball is unique and matches the playful, seaside theme. It is not just decorative—it is a key identifier of the ball as a toy designed for beach play. Altering the colors or pattern would change its symbolic meaning and visual role.
    Question: Does the beach ball have red, yellow, and white horizontal stripes?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The posture of the hippo leaning forward toward the ball conveys action and engagement, essential for storytelling and marketing a playful toy. This dynamic pose establishes the functional relationship between the toy and the ball, which must be preserved even in a studio setting to maintain logical consistency.
    Question: Is the hippo positioned leaning forward with its front limbs near the beach ball?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The round shape and proportional size of the beach ball relative to the hippo are important for scale accuracy and realism. A significantly larger or smaller ball would break the visual logic of the scene and affect how the toy is perceived in terms of usability.
    Question: Is the beach ball round and approximately the same height as the hippo’s torso?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The facial features—large dark eyes, small smile, and rounded ears—are key to expressing emotion and appeal, especially for children’s toys. These features contribute to the character’s charm and must be preserved to retain the intended emotional impact.
    Question: Does the hippo have large dark eyes, a small curved smile, and small rounded ears?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
