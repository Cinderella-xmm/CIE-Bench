Their presence is crucial for identifying the original environment. Even after transformation, if these mossy rocks are removed or altered in shape, the scene loses its foundational realism. This is a core environmental identifier with high visual weight.",
      "question": "Are the moss-covered rock formations along the stream clearly visible and preserved in their original positions and shapes?",

      "question": "Are the mossy boulders arranged in the same sequence along the stream as in the original image?",

Their absence or replacement would alter the scene’s color balance and botanical authenticity. Though minor, they are distinctive enough to warrant preservation.",
