      "thinking_process": "The Eiffel Tower’s lattice structure is its defining architectural feature. Its intricate ironwork, especially the triangular supports and arched base, is globally recognizable. Altering this would make the tower unidentifiable as the real Eiffel Tower. This is a core identity element, so losing it would destroy the image’s referential value. Hence, the question focuses on the **presence and structural integrity** of the tower’s iconic framework.",
      "question": "Is the Eiffel Tower’s full lattice structure, including its three-tiered arches and pointed spire, clearly visible and structurally accurate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The precisely trimmed, cube-shaped hedges are a signature feature of the Champ de Mars gardens. Their uniformity and alignment create a strong visual rhythm and define the park’s formal character. Any deviation in shape or spacing would break the symmetry and misrepresent the location. Thus, preserving their **geometric form and spacing** is critical for scene authenticity.",
      "question": "Are the hedges arranged in a straight line with consistent cubic shapes and even spacing along the left side of the pathway?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The central pathway acts as a visual anchor, connecting the foreground to the Eiffel Tower in the background. It establishes depth and perspective. If the pathway is distorted or redirected, the spatial logic collapses. Therefore, its **linear continuity and alignment** with the hedges and tower must be preserved.",
      "question": "Does the sandy pathway extend directly from the foreground toward the Eiffel Tower, maintaining a straight trajectory without bends or interruptions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The sun’s position in the upper-left quadrant with a distinct starburst effect is a key environmental detail contributing to the scene’s realism and mood. It affects shadow direction and highlights. While lighting can be adjusted, moving the sun or removing the starburst would alter the time-of-day perception and reduce fidelity. Thus, the **sun’s location and radiance pattern** are important for consistency.",
      "question": "Is the sun located in the upper-left portion of the sky with a clear starburst effect radiating outward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The lampposts with classic lanterns are recurring elements along the pathway, reinforcing the historical and urban character of the park. Their regular placement contributes to the sense of order. While they may be stylized slightly, removing or repositioning them would disrupt the scene’s authenticity. Hence, their **presence and interval pattern** are significant secondary details.",
      "question": "Are black lampposts with traditional lanterns evenly spaced along both sides of the pathway?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The presence of people in natural poses (walking, sitting) grounds the scene in reality and provides scale. While some may be stylized into silhouettes per the infographic design, their **original positioning and interaction with the environment** must remain intact beneath any overlay. Removing all people or relocating them drastically would misrepresent the park atmosphere.",
      "question": "Are there multiple individuals visible in the park, positioned naturally along the path and grassy areas, interacting with the environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
