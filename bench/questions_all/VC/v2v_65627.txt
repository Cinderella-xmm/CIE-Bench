Description of reference image: The subject is a block-style model of an elephant, constructed from various colored blocks. The elephant has a gray body, large pink inner ears, black eyes, and a yellow hat-like structure on top of its head. The trunk is gray, and there are red and yellow blocks forming a collar around its neck. The background is plain white, and the elephant is positioned facing forward.

### Step 1 - Allowed Changes List:

Thinking process: The instructions specify transforming the elephant into a whimsical 2D illustration with specific attributes like a plush body, velvety pink ears, a yellow hat, and a ruffled collar. The scene is also described in detail, indicating a new background with a spotlight, wooden stage, and a star-speckled curtain. Therefore, the following changes are allowed:

- Changing the elephant's form from a block-style model to a 2D illustration with a plush appearance.
- Adjusting the texture of the ears to appear velvety.
- Modifying the hat to look like a small yellow felt hat.
- Transforming the collar into a bright red and yellow ruffled design.
- Replacing the background with a new scene including a spotlight, wooden stage, and star-speckled curtain.

Allowed Changes List:
- Form transformation from block-style to 2D plush illustration.
- Texture adjustment of ears to velvety pink.
- Hat redesign to small yellow felt style.
- Collar redesign to bright red and yellow ruffled.
- Background replacement with a new scene.

### Step 2 - Preservation Targets List:

Thinking process: Core recognition elements include the elephant's distinct features like its large ears, trunk, and general shape. Functional/logical elements relate to the positioning of the hat and collar. Remaining elements like the color of the eyes and the overall posture contribute to visual coherence.

Preservation Targets List:
- Elephant's large ears and trunk shape.
- Position of the hat and collar relative to the elephant's head and neck.
- Black color of the eyes.
- Forward-facing posture of the elephant.
