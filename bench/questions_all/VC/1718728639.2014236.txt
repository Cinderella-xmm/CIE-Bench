Description of reference image: The subject is a female armored figure with long, flowing white hair and a regal, golden crown adorned with intricate geometric and gem-like details. She wears an ornate, form-fitting metallic armor composed of white and gold elements, featuring sculpted patterns resembling organic veins or circuitry across the chest and torso. The armor includes a high collar with dragon-like or serpentine motifs extending from the neck. Behind her are large, outstretched wings made of metallic feathers, rendered in gold and bronze tones with visible structural ridges and layered textures. Her posture is upright and frontal, facing directly toward the viewer, with a calm and dignified expression. The background is softly blurred, suggesting a futuristic or cathedral-like interior with tall vertical structures and diffused light sources, possibly glass or translucent panels.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions that clearly state what can be changed: "Transform the armored figure into a Byzantine mosaic," which implies a complete stylistic transformation of the subject’s appearance; "Convert the metallic armor into shimmering tesserae," indicating the material and texture of the armor must change; "Wing details become stylized with ornate feather motifs," meaning wing structure and design can be altered; "Background morphs into a celestial dome, with a circle of radiant light and decorative borders echoing ancient Christian iconography," confirming the background environment is fully replaceable. These changes authorize modification of surface materials, textures, color schemes, and environmental context. However, no instruction specifies changing the **subject's identity**, **pose**, **facial features**, or **overall anatomical form**—only their visual representation. Therefore, while style, texture, and setting are allowed to change, core identity-defining elements such as facial structure, body proportions, and pose must remain intact.

Allowed Changes List:
- Material of armor (metal → tesserae)
- Texture of armor (smooth metal → mosaic tiles)
- Color scheme of armor (white/gold → gold/azure mosaic)
- Wing structure (realistic metallic feathers → stylized ornamental feathers)
- Background environment (futuristic interior → celestial dome with iconographic borders)
- Surface patterns on armor (organic vein-like lines → geometric mosaic patterns)
- Lighting and atmosphere (modern diffuse lighting → radiant divine glow)

Thinking process:
Core recognition elements: The subject is not a well-known artwork character but a uniquely designed fantasy figure. Its core identity relies on specific visual markers: the **face shape and features**, particularly the **eyes, nose, lips, and skin tone**, which define her human identity and expression. The **white hair**, though color may shift slightly under mosaic rendering, remains a defining trait due to its contrast and length. The **crown’s shape and central gem** are iconic design elements—its angular, symmetrical form and embedded jewel are key identifiers. The **wing silhouette**—large, symmetrical, outstretched—is essential for identifying the figure as angelic or archangelic. Even if stylized, the wing span and positioning must retain their original spatial relationship to the body.

Functional/logical association elements: The **frontal pose** and **upright stance** establish the figure’s presence and authority. Altering this would disrupt the intended heroic or divine posture. The **connection between the crown and head**, and **wings attached to shoulder blades**, are functional placements that must be preserved to maintain logical anatomy and narrative coherence. If wings were moved or detached, the figure would lose its angelic identity.

Non modified element deduction: After excluding allowed changes (armor texture, wing detail, background), remaining unmentioned elements include: **facial features**, **hair color and flow**, **crown structure**, **armature of wings**, **body proportions**, **posture**, and **skin tone**. These are not mentioned in the instructions as changeable, so they must be retained to preserve the subject’s identity and realism within the transformed style.

Preservation Targets List:
- Facial structure and features (eyes, nose, lips, jawline)
- White hair color and flowing length
- Crown shape and central gem placement
- Wing silhouette and attachment point
- Frontal upright posture
- Body proportions and anatomical alignment
- Skin tone and facial expression

    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The face is the primary identifier of the subject, especially in a portrait-style composition. The specific shape of the eyes, the bridge and tip of the nose, the fullness of the lips, and the overall symmetry of the facial features are unique to this figure. Losing these would result in a different person or entity entirely. This is a core identity feature, making it critical to retain even after transformation into a mosaic style.
    Question: Does the edited image retain the original facial features including the eye shape, nose contour, lip fullness, and symmetrical jawline?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The white hair is a distinctive trait that contrasts sharply with the golden armor and wings. Its length, flow, and placement around the shoulders and back are consistent in the original image. While color might subtly shift in a mosaic style, the presence and volume of the white hair are essential for maintaining the figure’s identity. It is a key visual signature.
    Question: Is the white hair still present, flowing down past the shoulders, and positioned naturally around the head and neck?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

}

{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The crown is an iconic accessory with a distinct angular design and a central gemstone. Its placement atop the head and its ornate structure are integral to the figure’s regal and divine appearance. Any deviation in shape or gem position would alter the symbolic meaning and recognition of the character.
    Question: Is the crown still present with its original angular, symmetrical design and central gemstone at the apex?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The wings’ silhouette—large, symmetrical, and extended outward from the shoulders—is crucial for identifying the figure as an archangel. Even if stylized into mosaic form, the wing span, curvature, and attachment points must remain consistent with the original to preserve the sense of grandeur and balance.
    Question: Are the wings still symmetrically extended from the shoulders with the same broad, upward-curving shape and full span?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The frontal upright posture defines the figure’s presence and confidence. The arms are at the sides, and the body is aligned vertically, creating a balanced and authoritative stance. Changing this would distort the figure’s intent and narrative role. It is a functional pose that must be preserved.
    Question: Is the figure still standing upright with arms at the sides and facing directly forward?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The skin tone and facial expression contribute to the figure’s emotional and racial identity. The warm undertone of the skin and the neutral yet confident expression are part of her character. While lighting may change, the base tone and expression should remain recognizable.
    Question: Is the original skin tone preserved, and does the facial expression remain neutral with a slight hint of serenity?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The body proportions—specifically the torso-to-limb ratio and breast shape—are consistent with the original design. These are important for maintaining the figure’s aesthetic and anatomical coherence. Even in mosaic form, the underlying form must align with the original.
    Question: Are the body proportions, including the torso width, arm length, and breast shape, consistent with the original image?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
