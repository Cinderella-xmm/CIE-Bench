      "thinking_process": "The woman’s facial features—especially the shape of her eyes, nose, and mouth—are core identification markers. These define her distinct appearance and must remain intact even under semi-cartoon transformation. Loss of these would make her unrecognizable from the original. The hairstyle, being short and wavy, is also a key identifier. Therefore, this is a 3-point question.",
      "question": "Is the woman’s face clearly visible with the same eye shape, nose, mouth, and short wavy black hair as in the original image?",

      "thinking_process": "The two-tone color division of the robe—red on the right and navy blue on the left—is a unique design feature that distinguishes this garment. Changing this would fundamentally alter the robe’s identity. It is a core visual element tied to the subject’s appearance. Thus, it is a 3-point question.",
      "question": "Does the robe maintain the red-on-right and navy-blue-on-left color division across the torso and sleeves?",

      "thinking_process": "The floral embroidery, particularly the rose and vine pattern, is the most intricate and iconic detail of the robe. It is referenced in the instruction as a basis for the calendar’s design, making its retention essential. Even if enhanced, it must remain visually identifiable. This is a 3-point question.",
      "question": "Are the rose and vine floral patterns visible along the robe’s seams, front panel, and sleeves as in the original image?",

Their presence and arrangement (hanging in rows) establish the cultural and environmental context. Removing or altering them would break the scene’s authenticity. This is a 2-point question.",
