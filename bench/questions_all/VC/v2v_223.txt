Description of reference image: The subject is a Victorian-style dress displayed on a mannequin. The dress features a dark, textured fabric with floral patterns and includes intricate lace details at the collar and cuffs. It has puffed sleeves, a fitted bodice with button closures down the front, and a full skirt that flares out from the waist. The background is plain and neutral, ensuring the focus remains on the dress.

Thinking process: First, analyze the instructions that clearly state what can be changed, such as transforming the form into a 3D cartoon style, adjusting lighting to soft and colorful, adding skill bars or attributes, and including a title banner and name tag. These changes allow for modifications in style, color, and layout elements. However, the core identity of the Victorian Lady and her attire must remain recognizable.

Allowed Changes List:
Specific element 1 that allows for changes: Transforming the dress and scene into a 3D cartoon style.
(Specific element 2 that allows for changes: Adjusting the lighting to soft and colorful.)
(Specific element 3 that allows for changes: Adding skill bars or attributes like [Grace +10].)
(Specific element 4 that allows for changes: Including a title banner and name tag.)
(Specific element 5 that allows for changes: Changing the background to align with the Victorian era.)

Step 2- Determine the elements that should remain unchanged

Thinking process:
Core recognition elements: The Victorian Lady's iconic attire, including the detailed lacework, puffed sleeves, fitted bodice, and full skirt, are key identifiers. These elements must remain intact to preserve the character's identity.
Functional/logical association elements: The relationship between the dress components (e.g., how the bodice fits into the skirt) must be maintained to ensure logical coherence.
Non-modified element deduction: After excluding allowed changes, remaining details like the texture of the fabric and the specific placement of lace details need to be retained for visual consistency.

Preservation Targets List:â€‹
(Element 1 that should be maintained: Detailed lacework at the collar and cuffs)
(Element 2 that should be maintained: Puffed sleeves and fitted bodice design)
(Element 3 that should be maintained: Full skirt flaring from the waist)
(Element 4 that should be maintained: Floral pattern texture on the fabric)
