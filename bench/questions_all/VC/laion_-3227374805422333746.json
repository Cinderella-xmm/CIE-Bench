      "thinking_process": "The multi-gabled roof structure with three distinct sections (central tower, left wing, right wing) is the defining architectural form of the house. Its layered, overlapping shingles create a unique silhouette recognizable across different styles. If this structure is altered—such as merging the wings or flattening the roof—the building loses its core identity. Therefore, preserving the exact number and arrangement of roof sections is essential for recognition, making this a 3-point element.",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the original three-section gabled roof structure with a central tower and two side wings?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The diamond-shaped glowing windows on the upper level are critical visual cues that distinguish this house from others. Their shape, size, and position on the upper story provide both aesthetic and functional identity (light source). Altering their shape or moving them would break the visual logic of the building’s interior illumination and weaken its recognizability. Thus, their presence and placement are vital and warrant a 3-point weight.",
      "question": "Are the two diamond-shaped glowing windows located on the upper level of the central tower in their original positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The stone chimney on the left side of the roof is a distinctive feature that contributes to the asymmetry and realism of the structure. It is positioned specifically above the left wing and connects to the roofline. Removing or relocating it would alter the building’s balance and disrupt the implied function of heating. As a non-redundant architectural element, its retention is crucial for maintaining the original design integrity, hence a 2-point weight.",
      "question": "Is the stone chimney still present on the left side of the roof, extending upward from the left wing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The stack of logs beside the right doorway is a specific environmental detail that adds narrative context (fuel storage). Its position relative to the door and the barrel provides spatial logic. While small, its absence would reduce visual coherence and remove a key identifier of the original scene. Though not central to identity, it is a notable secondary detail that supports authenticity, earning a 2-point weight.",
      "question": "Is the stack of wooden logs still positioned beside the right arched doorway?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The hanging wooden barrel near the right arch is another distinct prop that reinforces the rustic, lived-in feel of the house. Its placement on a bracket and its cylindrical shape make it a recognizable feature. Removing it would diminish the richness of the scene and affect the perceived functionality of the building. While not core to structure, it is a key environmental detail, thus deserving a 2-point weight.",
      "question": "Is the wooden barrel still hanging from a bracket near the right arched doorway?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The two arched doorways on the ground floor—one open, one closed—are functional entry points that define access and symmetry. Their shape and placement are integral to the building’s front-facing design. Changing their form or position would disrupt the intended spatial flow and reduce recognition. Even if materials change, their arch shape and relative locations must remain. This is a key structural element, so it earns a 3-point weight.",
      "question": "Do the two arched doorways on the ground floor retain their original positions and arch shapes (one open, one closed)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The small potted plants on the exterior walls (one on the left, one on the right) are subtle but intentional decorative elements that add life to the scene. They are placed on brackets and contribute to the whimsical, lived-in aesthetic. While minor, their removal would slightly degrade visual completeness and coherence. As a detail-level feature, it receives a 1-point weight.",
      "question": "Are the two small green potted plants still visible on the exterior walls, one on each side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The corner wooden beams supporting the roof overhangs are structural elements that reinforce the half-timbered design. Their diagonal placement at the corners is a signature of the building’s construction style. Altering or removing them would compromise the architectural style and visual continuity. Though not immediately obvious, they are key to the building’s frame identity, so they are worth a 2-point weight.",
      "question": "Are the diagonal wooden beams still present at the corners of the roof overhangs?",
