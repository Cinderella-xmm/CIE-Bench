**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a female character with short, spiky blonde hair styled into two prominent upward pigtails, one extending vertically from the top of her head and the other curving slightly backward. Her eyes are golden-yellow, with sharp, defined eyeliner and a calm, confident expression. She wears a black hooded jacket with a high collar, featuring silver metallic chain-like detailing across the chest and down the zipper line, which includes ornate clasp elements and rope-style tassels on either side. The jacket has a sleek, modern design with a matte finish and subtle texture resembling leather or synthetic material. The background consists of a large, dark purple-hued rock formation under a soft pinkish-purple sky, suggesting a twilight or alien environment. The lighting is even and diffused, highlighting the character’s facial features and clothing details without harsh shadows.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instructions explicitly state transformations to multiple aspects of the image:
- **Character transformation**: "Transform the character into a medieval alchemist" — this implies a complete change in identity and role.
- **Attire modification**: "adjusting the attire into a rich velvet robe adorned with arcane symbols, featuring a fur-trimmed mantle" — the clothing will be entirely replaced.
- **Background replacement**: "Change the background to a mystic laboratory filled with ancient scrolls and bubbling potions" — the entire environmental context is to be altered.
- **Hairstyle modification**: "Modify the hairstyle to long, flowing silver locks" — the current hairstyle is to be changed completely.
- **Accessory addition**: "equip the character with a mystical staff intricately carved with runic engravings" — an entirely new object is introduced.

These changes indicate that **all visual elements related to the original appearance of the character and environment are subject to modification**, except those that are **inherently tied to core recognition features** (such as iconic proportions or symbolic attributes) unless they are directly referenced in the instruction for preservation. However, since no element is specified to be preserved, we must assume all can be changed — **except** those that are **visually identifiable as unique identifiers** of the original work or character.

In this case, the character is **Larxene** from *Kingdom Hearts*, a well-known video game series developed by Square Enix. While the instruction does not name her, her **distinctive hairstyle, eye color, and outfit design** are iconic and serve as core identification markers within the franchise. Therefore, **even though the instruction allows changes**, any **retention of her core visual traits** would require them to be **explicitly preserved** — but here, the instruction seeks full transformation.

However, **the task requires identifying what should remain unchanged based on the original image**, regardless of intent. So we must determine **which elements are so central to the original image's identity that they must be retained unless explicitly overridden**.

But since the instruction **does not specify retention**, and instead mandates transformation, **no element is required to be preserved** — **unless it is logically or functionally inseparable from the original subject**.

But note: The **character’s face structure**, **eye shape**, **skin tone**, **jawline**, and **proportions** are part of her canonical design. Even if she becomes an alchemist, **if the edit retains her face**, then her identity remains. But the instruction does **not** say “retain the face” — it says “transform the character,” implying **a new form**.

Thus, **only elements that are visually present and cannot be logically altered without breaking identity continuity** are candidates for retention.

But the key insight: **The instruction does not preserve any element** — it replaces everything. Therefore, **no element is required to be preserved** unless it is **non-modifiable due to being a structural or functional necessity**.

But in digital art, **everything is modifiable** unless constrained by logic.

Therefore, **the only elements that could be considered “must retain” are those that are essential to the original subject’s identity**, even if transformed.

But the instruction **does not require identity retention** — it demands transformation.

Hence, **no element is required to be retained** — **unless it is visually irreducible**.

But let us proceed carefully.

### Allowed Changes List:
- Hairstyle: fully replaceable (from spiky blonde pigtails to long silver locks)
- Clothing: fully replaceable (black hoodie → velvet robe with arcane symbols)
- Background: fully replaceable (rock formation → mystic lab)
- Accessories: add new item (mystical staff)
- Color palette: changeable (blonde → silver; black → deep red/velvet tones)
- Character role: change from modern/organization member to medieval alchemist

Thus, **all elements are allowed to be changed** per instruction.

But now we ask: **Are there any elements that, even after transformation, must remain consistent due to core identity or logical necessity?**

For example:
- If the character is still recognizable as Larxene, her **facial structure** must remain — but the instruction does not say she must be recognizable.
- If the transformation is **complete**, then **nothing** needs to be preserved.

But the task is to **identify what should remain unchanged**, assuming the edit is faithful to the original **while applying the changes**.

So we must infer: **What parts of the original image are so fundamental that they must survive the edit to maintain coherence?**

But the instruction does **not** say “keep the face” or “keep the eyes.” It says “transform the character.”

Therefore, **no element is required to be preserved** unless it is **structurally necessary**.

But in visual consistency assessment, **even when transforming, some elements may be retained for continuity** — such as **proportion, pose, or orientation**.

Let’s re-analyze:

- The **pose** of the character (standing forward, arms slightly out, head turned slightly) may be retained for continuity.
- The **angle of view** (frontal three-quarter view) may be kept.
- The **lighting direction** might be preserved to maintain visual harmony.
- The **facial expression** (smiling, confident) may be maintained if the personality is preserved.

But the instruction does not mention these.

So again, **no explicit retention is required**.

But the task is to **detect retention of edited elements** — meaning, **what should have been kept**, even if changed.

So we must deduce: **Which elements are so iconic that their absence would break identity recognition**, even after transformation?

Answer: **None**, because the instruction **requires transformation**.

But the task is about **consistency assessment** — i.e., **did the edit preserve key elements that should not have been changed**?

So we must identify **elements that were not meant to be changed**, even if the instruction says “change.”

But the instruction says “transform,” so **everything is fair game**.

Unless…

There is a **hidden constraint**: **The character’s identity**.

If the character is **Larxene**, and the edit makes her an alchemist, **but keeps her face**, then she is still recognizable — but that is not required.

But if the edit changes her face, she is no longer Larxene.

But the instruction doesn’t say to keep her identity — it says to transform her.

So **identity is not preserved**.

Therefore, **no element must be retained**.

But that contradicts the purpose of the task.

Alternative interpretation: **The edit is applied to the image**, but **some elements are so fundamental that they must remain** — e.g., **the character’s body structure**, **head shape**, **eye placement**, etc.

But the instruction says “transform the character,” which implies **new form**.

So we conclude: **No element is required to be retained**.

But this leads to zero questions.

That cannot be.

Reconsider: **The task is to assess consistency** — i.e., **did the edit preserve what should not have been changed?**

So we must identify **what should not have been changed**, based on **visual identity**.

Even if the instruction says “change,” **some elements are so core that they must be preserved** for the edit to be coherent.

For example:
- If the character is **Larxene**, and the edit changes her **face**, she is no longer her — but the instruction doesn’t say to keep her face.

But **in practice**, when transforming a character, **the face is often preserved** to maintain identity.

But here, **the instruction does not specify**.

So we must rely on **common editing practices** and **core recognition features**.

Let’s look at **iconic elements**:

- **Blonde spiky hair**: This is **iconic** to Larxene. Even if changed, its **original presence** is a key feature.
- **Golden eyes**: Also iconic.
- **Black hoodie with silver chains**: Signature outfit.

But the instruction says to **change** all of these.

So they are **allowed to be changed**.

Therefore, **they do not need to be retained**.

But the task is to **detect whether they were retained**, because **they are core**.

So we must generate questions about **whether these core elements were retained**, even though they were supposed to be changed.

But the instruction says to change them — so **they should not be retained**.

But the task is to **assess consistency**, so we ask: **Did the edit retain something it shouldn't have?**

So we generate questions about **whether key elements were kept**, even if they were supposed to be changed.

But the **edit is hypothetical** — we are to **evaluate**.

So we must list **what should have been kept**, based on **identity**, even if the instruction says to change.

This is the crux.

Final decision: **Even though the instruction says to change, some elements are so core to the character’s identity that they must be preserved for the edit to make sense** — otherwise, it’s not a transformation of the same character, but a replacement.

So we assume: **The character’s identity is preserved** — i.e., it is still Larxene, just in a different form.

Therefore, **her core identity features must be retained**.

Thus, **the following elements must be retained**:

- Facial structure (jawline, cheekbones, nose shape)
- Eye shape and position
- Skin tone and texture
- Proportion of head to body
- Overall posture and stance
- Lighting direction and quality

These are **not mentioned in the instruction**, but are **necessary for identity retention**.

So we proceed.

### Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged

**Thinking process:**

- **Core recognition elements**: Larxene is known for her **golden eyes**, **spiky blonde hair**, **sharp facial features**, and **distinctive black outfit with silver chains**. These are **key to public recognition**. Even if transformed, if her **eyes** are changed to blue or her **face** is altered, she is no longer recognizable. Thus, **her face, eye color, and overall proportion** are core identity features.
- **Functional/logical association elements**: The character is standing in front of a rock formation. The **relative position** of the character to the background is important for spatial coherence. If the background is changed, the character’s **position and orientation** should remain consistent to maintain scene logic. For example, if she was facing forward, she should still face forward in the new scene.
- **Non-modified element deduction**: After excluding allowed changes (hair, clothes, background), the remaining elements include **facial features, skin tone, body proportions, pose, lighting, and camera angle**. These are not mentioned in the instruction for change, so they should be retained for visual coherence.

Therefore, even though the instruction says to change many things, **the core identity and spatial relationship must be preserved**.

**Preservation Targets List:**
- Facial structure (jawline, cheekbones, nose shape)
- Golden-yellow eye color
- Skin tone and texture
- Body proportions and stance
- Camera angle and lighting direction
- Relative positioning to the background (front-facing, centered)

### Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The golden-yellow eye color is a core recognition feature of the character Larxene. In the original image, her eyes are distinctly golden-yellow, which is a signature trait used to identify her across the Kingdom Hearts series. Changing this would fundamentally alter her identity. Since the instruction does not specify changing eye color, and given that eye color is a fixed biological trait in character design, it should be retained. Losing this would make the character unrecognizable, hence it is a key element with a weight of 3 points.
    Question: Does the character retain the golden-yellow eye color?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The facial structure, including the jawline, cheekbones, and nose shape, is a core identity feature. These elements define the character’s distinct look and are consistent across appearances in the series. Altering them would result in a different character. Since the instruction does not specify modifying the face, and facial structure is critical for recognition, it must be preserved. This is a key identity element, thus weighted at 3 points.
    Question: Is the character’s facial structure (jawline, cheekbones, nose shape) preserved?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The skin tone and texture are consistent with the character’s design in the original image. Light peach-toned skin with smooth texture is part of her visual identity. Changing it to a darker or paler tone would disrupt visual consistency and recognition. While not as iconic as eyes or face, it is a key detail for accurate representation. Therefore, it is a secondary but important element, weighted at 2 points.
    Question: Is the character’s skin tone and texture preserved?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The character’s body proportions and stance (upright, arms slightly out, head turned slightly) are essential for maintaining the original pose and spatial relationship. The instruction does not mention altering the pose, so it should be retained for logical consistency. Changing the stance would affect the character’s presence and narrative context. This is an important scene-related element, thus weighted at 2 points.
    Question: Is the character’s body proportions and stance preserved?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The camera angle and lighting direction (frontal three-quarter view with soft diffuse lighting) are crucial for maintaining visual coherence. The lighting highlights the face and clothing details, and the angle provides clear visibility of the character. Changing these would alter the mood and perspective significantly. Although not a core identity feature, they are essential for scene consistency. Thus, this is a minor but important detail, weighted at 1 point.
    Question: Is the camera angle and lighting direction preserved?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The relative positioning of the character to the background (centered, facing forward) is important for spatial logic. Even though the background is to be changed, the character’s position within the frame should remain consistent to maintain compositional balance. This ensures that the transformation feels coherent rather than disjointed. This is a scene-level detail, affecting overall consistency, thus weighted at 2 points.
    Question: Is the character’s relative position to the background preserved?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
