### Description of Reference Image:
The subject is a plate containing a balanced meal consisting of chicken parmesan, a salad with leafy greens and possibly cucumbers, two orange slices, and a carton of skim milk. The plate is rectangular and white, placed on an orange tablecloth. The food items are neatly arranged on the plate, with the chicken parmesan taking up the largest portion on the right side, the salad on the left, and the orange slices positioned between them. The milk carton is placed behind the salad. There are no additional background elements.

### Thinking Process:
Changeable Scope Analysis:
1. **Text Additions & Layout Adjustments**: The instructions mention adding titles and logos, so these can be added per instruction.
2. **Enhance Colors**: The color saturation of the food, plate, and background can be enhanced.
3. **White Outlines**: Apply white outlines around the edges of the plate and other distinct elements.
4. **A4 Vertical Layout**: Reposition the image elements within the specified dimensions but maintain the relative positions of the meal contents.

Elements to Remain Unchanged:
1. **Core Visual Elements**:
   - The identifiable forms of the chicken parmesan, salad, orange slices, and milk carton.
   - The arrangement and proportions of the food.
   - The white plate and the orange tablecloth as background.
   
2. **Functional Relationships**:
   - The placement of the milk carton behind the salad, oranges in the middle, and chicken parmesan on the side must remain consistent to preserve the layout.
   - The distinct shapes and textures of the meal components should be retained for ease of identification.

3. **Visual Coherence**:
   - The details of the salad leaves, cheese texture on the chicken parmesan, and segments in the orange slices should be preserved.

### Preservation Targets List:
(Food item forms and texture)
(Meal arrangement and plate positioning)
(Plate and tablecloth color)
