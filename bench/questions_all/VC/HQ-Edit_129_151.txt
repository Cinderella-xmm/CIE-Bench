**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is an elderly man with white hair and a white mustache, wearing a traditional Japanese kimono in muted gray and dark green tones. He is seated sideways at a wooden table outdoors, leaning slightly forward with arms crossed, smiling gently while looking toward a chessboard placed before him. The chessboard features a unique set of pieces: green, pink, and yellow rubber ducks arranged in a chess-like formation, with one yellow duck standing alone on the right side of the board. The background consists of a serene park setting with large trees, dappled sunlight filtering through leaves, a calm reflecting pond behind the table, and soft moss-covered ground. The lighting is natural and diffused, suggesting early morning or late afternoon. The overall atmosphere is peaceful and contemplative.

Thinking process:  
The editing instructions specify transforming the image into a **Japanese woodblock style poster** titled *"The Duck Chessmaster's Wisdom"*, with specific stylistic and compositional changes. Key elements mentioned for modification include:
- **Style transformation**: From realistic photography to Japanese woodblock (Ukiyo-e) aesthetic.
- **Character portrayal**: Emphasizing the elder’s thoughtful demeanor—this suggests facial expression and posture may be refined but not fundamentally altered.
- **Environment detail**: Adding intricate trees and a reflecting pond—this implies enhancements to existing elements rather than replacement.
- **Color palette**: Shift to deep greens, earthy browns, and subtle grays—this affects color but not structure.
- **Typography**: Adding elegant calligraphy for the title in the lower right corner—this introduces new text but does not affect core visual content.

From this, we deduce that:
- The **subject’s identity** (elderly man in traditional attire) must remain recognizable.
- The **duck chess set** is central to the narrative and must retain its form and function.
- The **setting** (park, pond, trees) is to be enriched, not replaced.
- The **chessboard layout** and **relative positions** of ducks are implied to be preserved due to their role in storytelling.

Allowed Changes List:
- Artistic style (realistic → woodblock print)
- Color saturation and tonality (to match deep greens, browns, grays)
- Addition of stylized tree details and patterns
- Introduction of calligraphic text in lower-right corner
- Enhancement of textures (e.g., wood grain, fabric folds) to match woodblock aesthetics
- Adjustment of lighting and shadows to simulate flat, graphic illumination typical of Ukiyo-e

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements must be preserved because they define the subject and narrative:
- The **elderly man’s face**, particularly his **white hair**, **mustache**, and **smiling expression**, are key identifiers. Even in stylization, these features must remain recognizable.
- The **rubber duck chess pieces** are unconventional and iconic; their **shape**, **color**, and **arrangement** are essential to the narrative "Duck Chessmaster."
- The **chessboard itself** must remain intact as it functions as the game surface and spatial anchor.
- The **kimono**’s **form and fold pattern** are part of cultural identity and must be preserved despite potential stylistic simplification.
- The **pond reflection** and **tree silhouettes** are critical environmental cues that support serenity and context; altering them would disrupt scene logic.
- The **positioning of the man relative to the board** (leaning forward, arms crossed) establishes engagement and focus—this spatial relationship must be retained.

Functional/logical association elements:
- The **man interacting with the duck chess set** implies a direct relationship: he is playing or contemplating the game. Changing the board’s placement or removing ducks would break this logic.
- The **duck pieces must maintain their roles** (pawns, king, etc.) based on position—though stylized, their **groupings and hierarchy** should reflect original layout.

Non-modified element deduction:
After excluding allowed changes (style, color, texture, added text), the following must remain:
- Specific **duck colors** (green, pink, yellow)
- **Number and arrangement** of ducks (especially the isolated yellow duck on the right)
- **Man’s posture and gaze direction**
- **Table surface and board alignment**
- **Background pond and tree outlines** (not just presence, but general shape and location)

Preservation Targets List:
- The elderly man’s white hair and mustache
- The rubber duck chess pieces (colors, shapes, positions)
- The chessboard layout and grid pattern
- The man’s seated posture and crossed arms
- The reflective pond and surrounding trees
- The kimono’s silhouette and fold lines
- The relative positioning of man, board, and pond

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The white hair and mustache are the most distinctive facial features of the elderly man, serving as core identity markers. Their absence or alteration would make the character unrecognizable, especially since the narrative centers on his wisdom. This is a 3-point element due to its irreplaceable role in identifying the subject.
    Question: Is the elderly man depicted with white hair and a white mustache?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The rubber duck chess pieces are the defining feature of the narrative. The green, pink, and yellow ducks are uniquely shaped and colored, forming a functional chess set. Their retention ensures the story of "Duck Chessmaster" remains intact. Losing any key duck or changing its form would break the concept.
    Question: Are the chess pieces composed of rubber ducks in green, pink, and yellow colors?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The chessboard’s grid pattern and its position beneath the ducks are essential for establishing the game context. The board’s presence and structure define the activity being performed. Altering or removing it would destroy the functional logic of the scene.
    Question: Is the chessboard visible beneath the duck pieces, with a green-and-brown checkered pattern?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The man’s posture—seated, leaning forward with arms crossed—establishes his engagement and contemplative mood. This pose is critical to portraying him as a wise figure involved in thought. Changing it would misrepresent his demeanor and weaken the narrative.
    Question: Is the man seated with his arms crossed and leaning slightly forward toward the board?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The reflective pond behind the table provides depth and serenity, reinforcing the tranquil environment. Its presence and approximate shape are important for maintaining scene coherence and supporting the "wise elder in nature" theme. While stylized, it must remain visually identifiable.
    Question: Is there a reflective pond visible directly behind the table?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The kimono’s silhouette and fold lines contribute to cultural authenticity and character identity. While texture may change in woodblock style, the garment’s shape and wrapping pattern must remain consistent to preserve the traditional appearance.
    Question: Does the man wear a traditional kimono with visible fold lines and layered sleeves?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The isolated yellow duck on the far right of the board serves as a visual focal point and likely represents the king or final piece. Its position and distinct color make it a key narrative element. Moving or replacing it would alter the game’s implied structure.
    Question: Is there a single yellow duck standing alone on the rightmost square of the board?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}

{
    Q8: 
    Thinking process: The background trees frame the scene and provide natural context. Their general shape and placement near the pond are necessary for environmental continuity. While details may be enhanced, their basic form must remain.
    Question: Are large trees visible in the background, partially framing the scene on both sides?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
