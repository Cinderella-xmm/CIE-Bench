**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a white unicorn standing in a dark, moonlit forest. The unicorn has a thick, shaggy coat with a textured, woolly appearance resembling that of a heavy breed horse, such as a Shire or Clydesdale. Its mane and tail are long, flowing, and silvery-white, with soft curls and natural movement. The unicorn possesses two prominent, sharp horns on its forehead—both straight, pointed, and made of a smooth, ivory-like material. Its eyes are large, dark, and expressive, conveying a sense of wisdom and serenity. The creature stands in a three-quarter profile facing right, with its head slightly turned toward the viewer. It is positioned on uneven ground covered in mossy rocks and earthy soil, surrounded by bare, gnarled trees with twisted branches reaching into the sky. A full moon glows brightly in the night sky above, casting a soft light that illuminates the scene from behind the unicorn, creating subtle highlights on its fur and horns. The atmosphere is mystical and serene, with deep shadows and minimal ambient detail.

Thinking process:  
The editing instruction explicitly states:  
- "Transform the unicorn into a ceramic sculpture" → This indicates the **subject's form and material** are to be changed entirely.  
- "Smooth, glazed surface in creamy white" → The texture and color of the unicorn’s body will change.  
- "Replace the mane and tail with delicate porcelain curls" → The **mane and tail** are to be replaced in both form and material.  
- "Design the horn as a polished metallic spiral" → The **shape and material of the horn(s)** must change.  
- "Position the sculpture in a minimalist gallery setting with a gently textured stone base" → The **entire background environment** is to be replaced.  

Therefore, the following elements are **allowed to change**:  
- The unicorn’s **material** (from living animal to ceramic).  
- The **texture** of the body (from woolly fur to smooth glazed surface).  
- The **color** of the body (from pure white to creamy white).  
- The **mane and tail** (from flowing hair to porcelain curls).  
- The **horns** (from two straight ivory horns to one metallic spiral).  
- The **scene/environment** (from dark forest to minimalist gallery).  
- The **ground surface** (from mossy rocks to stone base).  
- The **lighting** (from moonlight to gallery lighting).  

Allowed Changes List:  
- Subject’s material (living animal → ceramic)  
- Body texture (woolly fur → smooth glazed)  
- Mane and tail (natural hair → porcelain curls)  
- Horns (two straight horns → one metallic spiral)  
- Background (forest → gallery)  
- Ground (mossy terrain → stone base)  
- Lighting (moonlit night → gallery illumination)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

Thinking process:  
We now identify what **must remain unchanged**, based on exclusion from the allowed changes list and logical consistency with the original image.

**Core recognition elements:**  
While the subject is being transformed into a sculpture, the **identity of the subject as a unicorn** must still be preserved. Key features that define a unicorn include:  
- The **presence of a horn** (even if reimagined).  
- The **equine form** (horse-like body shape, four legs, head structure).  
- The **position and orientation** of the body (three-quarter view, facing right).  
- The **overall silhouette** of the horse (massive build, high-set head, arched neck).  

Even though the horn will become a spiral, the **presence of a single horn on the forehead** is essential for identity. However, the instruction specifies *one* polished metallic spiral horn — this implies a **change in number** (from two to one), so **number of horns is not fixed**. But the **location** (forehead) and **function** (horned equine) must still be preserved.

**Functional/logical association elements:**  
- The **unicorn’s posture** (standing upright, head slightly turned) supports the idea of a static display object, which aligns with a sculpture. This posture can be retained.  
- The **orientation** (facing right, three-quarter view) is important for visual continuity and should be preserved unless instructed otherwise.  
- The **basic equine anatomy** (four legs, torso, neck, head) must remain intact; otherwise, it would no longer resemble a horse.  

**Non-modified element deduction:**  
Although the **texture, material, and specific details** like mane and tail are to be replaced, certain **anatomical proportions** and **structural relationships** must remain consistent to maintain visual coherence:  
- The **proportion between head and body**.  
- The **placement of limbs relative to torso**.  
- The **shape of the face**, especially the **eye position**, **nostrils**, and **mouth** — these are key to identifying the animal as equine.  
- The **overall size and scale** of the figure relative to the space (though environment changes, the figure’s scale should be preserved).  

Importantly, the **original image contains two horns**, but the instruction specifies **one spiral horn**. Since this is a transformation, we accept that **the number of horns may change**, but the **presence of a horn on the forehead** remains a core requirement. Therefore, **a horn must exist**, even if altered.

Preservation Targets List:  
- The **equine body structure** (four legs, horse-like torso, neck, head).  
- The **three-quarter stance facing right**.  
- The **head orientation** (slightly turned toward viewer).  
- The **eye placement and shape** (large, dark, oval-shaped eye).  
- The **overall silhouette and mass distribution** (broad shoulders, sturdy legs, arched neck).  
- The **presence of a horn on the forehead** (regardless of shape or number, at least one must remain).  
- The **relative positioning of limbs and body parts** (e.g., front legs slightly forward, back legs supporting weight).  

Note: While the **mane and tail** are to be replaced, their **presence** (i.e., flow of hair from neck and rump) is implied in the new design ("porcelain curls"), so their **functional location** is preserved. However, their **form** is changed.

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The presence of a horn on the forehead is the defining feature of a unicorn. Even though the instruction changes the horn to a metallic spiral, the **presence of a horn** is non-negotiable for identity. If the horn is missing, the subject is no longer a unicorn. The original image shows two horns, but the instruction allows reduction to one. Therefore, the **existence of at least one horn on the forehead** is a core identity feature. Loss of this would make the subject unrecognizable as a unicorn. Hence, it is a 3-point question.
    Question: Is there at least one horn present on the forehead of the unicorn?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The equine body structure—specifically the four-legged horse-like form—is essential to the subject’s identity. Changing this would transform it into a different creature. The original image clearly shows a horse-shaped body with four legs, a neck, and a head. Even as a sculpture, the basic anatomy must be preserved to maintain recognition. Altering limb count or body shape would break identity. Thus, this is a core structural element and weighs 3 points.
    Question: Does the subject have four legs arranged in a horse-like stance?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The three-quarter profile facing right is a key compositional element in the original image. It defines the spatial relationship between the viewer and the subject. Although the setting changes, the **orientation** of the figure is crucial for visual continuity. If the sculpture faces another direction, the composition is fundamentally altered. This is not a core identity feature, but an important scene-related element affecting overall consistency. Therefore, it is weighted at 2 points.
    Question: Is the unicorn positioned in a three-quarter view facing toward the right side of the image?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The eye is a critical facial feature for expression and species identification. In the original image, the eye is large, dark, and oval-shaped, located on the side of the head. Even as a sculpture, the eye’s **presence and position** must be preserved to maintain the equine likeness. Removing or relocating it would distort the face. While the material may change, the **visual location and shape** of the eye are key to recognition. This is an important detail affecting realism and coherence, hence 2 points.
    Question: Is there a visible dark, oval-shaped eye on the side of the unicorn's head?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The head is slightly turned toward the viewer, giving a sense of engagement. This posture is distinct in the original image and contributes to the emotional tone. Even as a sculpture, preserving this **head turn** maintains the original dynamic. It is not a core identity feature, but a secondary detail that affects visual narrative and coherence. If lost, the sculpture appears less lifelike or engaged. Thus, it is a minor but meaningful detail, worth 1 point.
    Question: Is the unicorn's head slightly turned toward the viewer, showing part of the left side of the face?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The overall body silhouette—particularly the broad shoulders, arched neck, and muscular build—is characteristic of the unicorn in the original image. This shape distinguishes it from other equines and contributes to its mythical grandeur. Even as a ceramic sculpture, the **general outline and mass distribution** must remain similar to preserve identity. A radically different shape would make it unrecognizable. This is a core structural element, thus 3 points.
    Question: Does the unicorn have a broad, muscular body with a high-set head and arched neck?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The position of the legs—specifically, the front legs slightly forward and the back legs supporting the weight—defines the stance. This is a functional anatomical detail that ensures the figure appears balanced and natural. Even as a sculpture, this **weight distribution** must be preserved to avoid appearing unstable or unnatural. It is a key detail for realism and coherence, so it receives 2 points.
    Question: Are the front legs positioned slightly forward, with the back legs supporting the body's weight?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
