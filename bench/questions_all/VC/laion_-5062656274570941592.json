      "thinking_process": "The lantern held by Joseph is a key identifying feature that distinguishes him from Mary and confirms his role as the protector and provider in the scene. Its presence is critical for narrative accuracy and character identification. Even if rendered in porcelain with gold leaf, the lantern must remain in Joseph’s hand to maintain identity. Without it, Joseph could be misidentified, undermining the scene’s authenticity.",
      "question": "Is Joseph depicted holding a lantern in his right hand?",

      "thinking_process": "Mary’s posture of kneeling with hands clasped in prayer is a canonical representation of her humility and devotion. This gesture is essential for identifying her role and emotional state. Any alteration to this pose would distort the spiritual message of the scene. The pose must be preserved regardless of material or finish.",
      "question": "Is Mary shown kneeling with both hands clasped in front of her chest?",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The infant Jesus lying in a manger with a radiant halo is the central focus of the nativity scene. The halo signifies divinity, and the manger represents humble birth. Both are indispensable for the scene’s religious significance. Even if the manger is reimagined in marble, the infant must still be placed within it, and the halo must remain around his head.",
      "question": "Is the infant Jesus lying in a manger with a halo composed of radiating lines around his head?",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The donkey and sheep are traditional animal companions in nativity scenes, symbolizing the humble surroundings and the inclusion of creation in Christ’s birth. Their presence reinforces the biblical context. Removing either would diminish the completeness of the scene. Even if stylized in porcelain, both animals must be present near the manger.",
      "question": "Are a donkey and a sheep present in the scene, positioned near the manger?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The star above the roof is a key symbolic element representing the Star of Bethlehem, guiding the Magi. Its placement atop the structure is iconic and necessary for the scene’s narrative. Even if transformed into a gold leaf ornament, the star must remain at the peak of the roof to maintain symbolic continuity.",
      "question": "Is there a five-pointed star positioned at the apex of the roof structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The palm tree to the left of the stable adds geographical and symbolic context, suggesting a Middle Eastern setting. It is a distinctive environmental feature in this particular version of the nativity scene. Though not universal, its presence contributes to the visual identity of this specific artwork. It must remain in the same relative position to preserve the composition.",
      "question": "Is there a stylized palm tree located to the left side of the stable structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "Halos around the heads of Joseph, Mary, and Jesus are essential for identifying their sacred status. They are standard in religious iconography and must be preserved in any reinterpretation. Even if rendered in gold leaf, the circular halos must remain around each of the three holy figures.",
      "question": "Are there circular halos present around the heads of Joseph, Mary, and Jesus?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "thinking_process": "The manger serves as the cradle for Jesus and is the focal point of the scene. Its function as a resting place for the infant must be maintained. Even if reimagined in marble, the manger must still hold the infant Jesus and be centrally located beneath the roof.",
      "question": "Is the infant Jesus positioned inside a manger-like structure beneath the roof?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q9",
      "thinking_process": "The relative positioning of the figures—Joseph on the left, Mary on the right, Jesus in the center—is a standard compositional convention in nativity scenes. This arrangement supports narrative balance and viewer understanding. Changing it would disrupt the expected visual hierarchy and theological symbolism.",
      "question": "Is Joseph positioned on the left side of the stable, Mary on the right, and Jesus in the center?",
