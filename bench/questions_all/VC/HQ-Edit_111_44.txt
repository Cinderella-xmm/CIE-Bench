**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is an elderly African woman standing in the foreground of a bustling outdoor marketplace. She faces slightly to the right, with her head turned toward the viewer, displaying a dignified expression. Her skin is deeply wrinkled, indicating age, and she wears a highly ornate headdress composed of multicolored beads arranged in dense clusters, forming a spherical shape atop her head. The base of the headdress features woven fabric with geometric patterns in orange, red, and yellow tones. She wears large, circular gold-colored earrings and multiple layered necklaces made of colorful beads in red, green, blue, and yellow, some adorned with metallic pendants. Her arms are covered in numerous bangles—gold, brass, and colored metal—stacked tightly from wrist to elbow. She is dressed in a long, patterned garment with intricate embroidery in bright colors: blue, yellow, red, and green, featuring traditional African motifs such as spirals, diamonds, and concentric circles. Her hands are clasped gently in front of her, holding a small wooden bowl or container.

The background depicts a narrow market alleyway lined with stalls selling fresh produce such as tomatoes, oranges, green beans, peppers, grains, and dried legumes. These goods are displayed in woven baskets and shallow bowls on stone or dirt ground. Various people populate the scene: men and women wearing traditional garments like turbans, robes, and headwraps in earthy tones (white, red, beige). Some sit behind their wares; others converse or trade. Buildings on either side are made of sun-baked mud bricks, with hanging textiles, rugs, and woven mats displayed along the walls. A large, tanned canvas canopy stretches overhead, casting soft shadows across the street. The lighting is warm daylight, enhancing the rich textures and colors of the scene.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction states: *"Transform the central figure into a regal African queen from an ancient kingdom, enhancing her attire with intricate golden embroidery and elaborate beadwork."* This indicates that **the form, clothing, and adornments of the central figure are permitted to change**, specifically to elevate her status and aesthetic richness. The phrase "enhancing her attire" implies existing elements may be modified but not necessarily replaced entirely—so **core identity features of the original figure (e.g., facial structure, posture, general silhouette)** might still be preserved under transformation.

Further: *"Depict her standing in a grand marketplace with vibrant textiles around..."* — this suggests the **marketplace setting is to be retained**, though possibly elevated in scale or grandeur. However, it does **not explicitly require preservation of specific goods or vendors**, so those could be altered.

*"Stylize the scene with warm, earthen tones, adding historical symbols to the market goods, reflecting cultural richness and ancestral heritage."* — this confirms **color palette adjustments are allowed**, and **new symbolic elements can be added to goods**, implying **existing goods may be reinterpreted or augmented**.

Thus, the **allowed changes** include:
- Transformation of the central figure’s attire (beadwork, embroidery, regal elements)
- Enhancement of her status (queenly appearance)
- Modification of market goods to include historical symbols
- Adjustment of color tone and lighting for warmth
- Possible addition of new figures paying homage

However, the instruction **does not state** that the **original subject’s facial features, posture, hand position, or core body shape** should be changed—only enhanced. Also, **no mention is made of changing the marketplace layout or removing key background elements** like the canopy, buildings, or vendor positions.

Therefore, **any element not explicitly mentioned for modification must be assumed to remain unless logically inconsistent with the new depiction**.

---

**Allowed Changes List:**
- Attire details (beadwork, embroidery, jewelry) of the central figure
- Status representation (e.g., crown, royal regalia)
- Market goods (can include historical symbols, new items)
- Color tone and lighting (warm, earthen)
- Addition of villagers paying homage
- Stylization of textiles and architectural details
- Background figures’ roles (may be reinterpreted as subjects or courtiers)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
We now identify what **must remain unchanged** based on exclusion from the allowed changes list and logical consistency.

**Core recognition elements:**  
- The **facial features** of the central figure (wrinkles, skin texture, facial structure) are not mentioned for change. Since she is being transformed into a queen, her face likely remains recognizable as the original subject. Her **identity as an elderly African woman** is central to the image’s authenticity.
- Her **posture**: standing upright, facing slightly right, hands clasped in front—this spatial orientation and gesture define her presence and interaction with the environment.
- Her **hand position** holding a small bowl—this is a functional detail suggesting she is engaged in trade or offering, which supports narrative coherence.
- The **presence of the market setting**: while stylized, the instruction says “depict her standing in a grand marketplace,” meaning the **basic layout of the alleyway, stalls, and vendors must remain**, even if upgraded.

**Functional/logical association elements:**  
- The **relationship between the central figure and the market**: she stands within it, not above or outside it. Changing her position would break spatial logic.
- The **position of the canopy overhead**: it provides shade and defines the space. Removing it would alter the environmental logic.
- The **stone-paved ground and basket arrangement**: these establish the tactile reality of the market. While goods may change, their **placement in baskets and on the ground** must be preserved to maintain realism.

**Non-modified element deduction:**  
After excluding allowed changes:
- The **texture of her skin** (deep wrinkles, dark pigmentation) must remain—this is part of her identity.
- The **bangles on her arms** are described as stacked, metallic, and covering from wrist to elbow—though more may be added, the **original layering style must persist**.
- The **woven baskets** filled with produce are present throughout; they are iconic to the scene and serve as visual anchors.
- The **buildings' material (mud brick)** and **hanging textiles** are not mentioned for change, so they must be retained.

Thus, despite enhancements, the **core visual identity of the woman and the structural integrity of the marketplace** must be preserved.

---

**Preservation Targets List:**
- Facial structure and skin texture of the central figure
- Standing posture with hands clasped in front
- Presence of the overhead canopy
- Stone-paved ground and basket-filled stalls
- Woven baskets containing produce (tomatoes, oranges, green beans, etc.)
- Mud-brick buildings with hanging textiles
- Original hand position holding a small bowl
- Stack of bangles on both arms
- Position of the central figure in the foreground, facing slightly right
