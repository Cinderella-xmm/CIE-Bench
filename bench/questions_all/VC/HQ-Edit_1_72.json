      "thinking_process": "The subject’s facial structure, particularly the shape of the nose, lips, and eyes, is a core identification feature. Any significant alteration would make the individual unrecognizable. The instruction does not allow changing the person’s identity, only enhancing or stylizing. Therefore, preserving the original facial features is critical for maintaining identity, making this a 3-point question.",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the original subject’s facial features, including the shape of the nose, lips, eyes, and skin tone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The Dashiki’s V-neck with diamond-shaped motifs is a distinctive design element that defines the garment’s identity. Even with added gold embellishments, the underlying pattern must remain visible. Losing this would transform the garment into something unrecognizable as a Dashiki, which contradicts the instruction to emphasize it as a regal version. Thus, this is a core structural feature worth 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the central V-neck pattern with diamond motifs clearly visible on the Dashiki in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The tassels at the bottom of the Dashiki are a unique decorative feature specific to this garment style. Their presence confirms authenticity and continuity with the original. Although the style may be stylized, removing or altering them would compromise the garment’s identity. This is a key detail, but not as foundational as the face or main pattern, hence 2 points.",
      "question": "Are the tassels at the bottom hem of the Dashiki still present and positioned at the same location as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The hands clasped in front at waist level define the subject’s posture and gesture. Changing this would alter the intended expression of dignity and calmness. Since no instruction specifies changing posture, it must be preserved. This is a functional pose that contributes to the character’s portrayal as a cultural guardian, making it important but not irreplaceable — thus 2 points.",
      "question": "Are the hands positioned in front of the body, clasped together at waist level, as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The tall golden grass in the foreground is a key environmental element that establishes the savanna setting. Its presence is required by the instruction to preserve the scene. Even if stylized, it must remain visually distinct as tall grass. Removing or replacing it would break the scene logic. This is an important background feature, so it earns 2 points.",
      "question": "Is there tall, golden-colored grass in the foreground surrounding the subject’s lower body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The acacia trees in the background, with their characteristic flat-topped canopy, are iconic to African savannas. The instruction requires them to be present, albeit stylized. Their silhouette and placement must remain recognizable to maintain the scene’s authenticity. While stylization is allowed, their basic form must be preserved. This is a major scene element, so it is weighted at 2 points.",
      "question": "Are there acacia trees with flat-topped canopies visible in the background behind the subject?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The subject’s hair texture — short, curly, and voluminous — is a defining physical trait. While lighting or color might shift, the overall shape and structure must remain. Altering it drastically (e.g., straightening or shaving) would change identity. This is a minor but identifiable feature, so it is assigned 1 point.",
      "question": "Does the subject’s hair retain its short, curly, and voluminous texture as seen in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "thinking_process": "The central positioning of the subject within the frame is crucial for compositional balance and focus. The instruction implies he remains the focal point, so shifting him off-center or changing perspective would disrupt the intended emphasis. This is a minor compositional detail but affects visual coherence, hence 1 point.",
      "question": "Is the subject centrally positioned in the frame, facing forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
