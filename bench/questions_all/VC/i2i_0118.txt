Description of reference image: The subject is Pikachu, a famous Pokémon, depicted in a cheerful stance with both arms raised. Pikachu has a bright yellow body, black-tipped pointy ears, red cheeks, a small nose, a smiling mouth revealing a single tooth, and black eyes. It stands on two legs with simple claws.

### Step 1 - Analyze Modification Requirements
**Thinking process:**  
The instructions specify transforming Pikachu into a half-body form emerging from a children's tablet screen with a welcoming gesture. This implies that the full-body form can be altered, but core visual features like Pikachu's shape, color, and iconic elements (ears, cheeks, etc.) should remain consistent. The background will change entirely as it involves a new setting – a tablet interface. Proportion, posture, and scene interaction can be adjusted as long as Pikachu remains recognizable.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
1. Full-body form alteration to half-body.  
2. Background transformation to a children's tablet screen.  
3. Posture adjustment to a welcoming gesture.  
4. Proportion changes to fit a half-body emerging effect.  

### Step 2 - Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged
**Thinking process:**  
Core recognition elements include Pikachu's bright yellow color, pointy black-tipped ears, red cheeks, and distinct facial expression (black eyes, smiling mouth). Functional/logical elements include the positioning of its arms (open in a welcoming manner) and maintaining the cheerful, friendly demeanor consistent with its character. Remaining visual details like Pikachu's basic limb structure and color consistency should also be retained for coherence.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
1. Bright yellow body color  
2. Pointy black-tipped ears  
3. Red cheeks  
4. Black eyes and smiling mouth  
5. Basic limb structure and color
