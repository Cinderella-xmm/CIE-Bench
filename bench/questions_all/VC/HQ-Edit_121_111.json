      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "The squirrel’s upright posture with hind legs supporting the body and front paws raised is a core behavioral identifier in this image. This posture defines the animal’s interaction with the environment and object. If lost, the character becomes unrecognizable as performing the intended action. Therefore, it is a key identity-preserving element and carries high weight.",
      "question": "Is the squirrel depicted in an upright stance, supported by its hind legs, with its front paws raised toward its mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The squirrel’s face, particularly the positioning of the eyes, nose, and whiskers, is a core recognition feature. The large, dark eye and pointed snout are distinctive and help identify the species. Altering these would make the creature unrecognizable as a squirrel, even with magical additions. Thus, this is a fundamental identity element.",
      "question": "Are the squirrel’s facial features, including its dark round eyes, pointed nose, and visible whiskers, clearly present and accurately rendered?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The squirrel’s tail is a defining anatomical feature — large, bushy, and arched over its back. Its shape and texture are crucial for identification. Even if stylized, the tail’s presence and form must remain to preserve the animal’s identity. Loss of this would compromise recognition.",
      "question": "Does the squirrel have a large, bushy tail that curves upward and backward over its body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The pencil lying diagonally in the foreground is a unique contextual element suggesting an artistic theme. It is not typical in natural wildlife scenes and adds narrative depth. Since the instruction does not mention removing it, and it is visually distinct, its presence must be preserved to maintain consistency with the original image’s meta-narrative.",
      "question": "Is there a wooden pencil visible in the lower right foreground, partially embedded in the grass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The paintbrush in the upper right corner is another key symbolic element indicating artistic creation. It interacts with the frame of the image, reinforcing the idea of illustration. As it is not mentioned in the editing instructions to remove, and is a distinctive detail, it should be retained to preserve the original artistic context.",
      "question": "Is a paintbrush with a red handle and silver ferrule visible in the upper right corner of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The squirrel’s front paws are shown gripping an object (acorn). This hand-like grasp is central to the narrative of gathering food. Even if the object changes, the gesture must remain to preserve functional logic. The configuration of the paws around the object is a key behavioral detail.",
      "question": "Are the squirrel’s front paws clasping an object tightly, with fingers wrapped around it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The grassy ground plane and its texture provide environmental grounding. While the background may be blurred into a fairytale forest, the immediate foreground grass and soil area must remain consistent in layout to maintain spatial logic. The presence of grass blades and earth patches beneath the squirrel supports realism and placement.",
      "question": "Is the squirrel standing on a patch of green grass with visible blades and small soil areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "thinking_process": "The squirrel’s ears are upright and pointed, with orange inner fur. This is a distinguishing trait contributing to species recognition. While color may be altered per instructions, the shape and position must remain unchanged to preserve identity.",
      "question": "Are the squirrel’s ears upright and pointed, with visible orange inner fur?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
