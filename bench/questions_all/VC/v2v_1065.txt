### Description of Reference Image:
The subject is a skateboarder captured mid-air while performing a trick. He has curly, shoulder-length hair and is wearing a black T-shirt, olive-green pants, and black-and-white skate shoes. His posture shows him crouched with knees bent, arms extended for balance, and his skateboard flipping beneath him. The background consists of a skate park with smooth concrete ramps and bowls, surrounded by tall palm trees under a clear blue sky.

### Thinking Process:
The editing instructions specify transforming the subject into a chibi-style 3D figure inside a snow globe. This means the subject's physical form, size, and style will change significantly. However, certain core elements must remain consistent to preserve the identity of the skateboarder and the action depicted. The scene outside the snow globe also introduces new elements but requires retaining some visual coherence with the original skate park setting.

#### Allowed Changes List:
- Subject's physical form (transformed into a chibi-style 3D figure).
- Scene transformation (from an outdoor skate park to a snow globe setting with tiny palm trees and ramps).
- Addition of new elements like snowfall and light rays filtering through the window.

#### Preservation Targets List:
- Core recognition elements: The skateboarder's action (mid-trick pose), clothing colors and styles, and the skateboard.
- Functional/logical association elements: The relationship between the skateboarder and the skateboard (e.g., the trick being performed).
- Remaining elements: The general skate park theme (tiny ramps and palm trees inside the globe).

### Question Generation:

#### Q1:
**Thinking process:** The skateboarder's mid-trick pose is a core recognition feature. Losing this would make the image lose its identity as a skateboarding scene. The specific posture, with knees bent and arms extended, is crucial for depicting the trick.

**Question:** Does the edited image retain the skateboarder's mid-trick pose, with knees bent and arms extended for balance?

**Choices:** Yes, No

**A:** Yes

**Weight:** 3

---

#### Q2:
**Thinking process:** The skateboard is a key accessory that defines the activity. Its presence and orientation relative to the skateboarder are essential for maintaining the context of the trick.

**Question:** Is the skateboard visible beneath the skateboarder, oriented as if in motion during a trick?

**Choices:** Yes, No

**A:** Yes

**Weight:** 2

---

#### Q3:
**Thinking process:** The clothing colors and styles are important for visual consistency. While the style may change to chibi, the colors should remain recognizable.

**Question:** Does the skateboarder wear a black T-shirt and olive-green pants in the edited image?

**Choices:** Yes, No

**A:** Yes

**Weight:** 2

---

#### Q4:
**Thinking process:** The skate park theme is a secondary detail that helps maintain visual coherence. The presence of tiny ramps and palm trees inside the snow globe connects the scene to the original setting.

**Question:** Are there tiny ramps and palm trees visible inside the snow globe, reflecting the skate park theme?

**Choices:** Yes, No

**A:** Yes

**Weight:** 1

---

#### Q5:
**Thinking process:** The relationship between the skateboarder and the skateboard is a functional element. The skateboarder must appear to be actively performing a trick with the skateboard.

**Question:** Does the skateboarder appear to be actively interacting with the skateboard, as if performing a trick?

**Choices:** Yes, No

**A:** Yes

**Weight:** 3

These questions focus on retaining the core identity, functional associations, and secondary details of the original image while allowing for the specified transformations.
