Description of reference image: The subject is a woman in the foreground who is elegantly raising a glass. She has medium-length brown hair, is wearing a cream-colored knitted sweater, and exhibits a warm smile. She is holding a clear wine glass filled with white wine. In the background, there are people sitting around wooden tables, engaging in conversations or activities. The setting appears to be an indoor space with green walls, wooden shelves, and windows with skylights.

### Step 1 - Allowed Changes List

Thinking process:  
The editing instructions request transforming the photo into a hand-painted watercolor style. This implies the subject’s appearance, such as her hair, attire, and facial features, can be rendered in watercolor textures. The background figures can be simplified with light-colored linework and faint washes, meaning their detailed features and colors can be altered significantly.

Allowed Changes List:  
- The woman's facial features, attire, and hair can be redrawn in a watercolor style.
- Background figures can be simplified with light-colored linework and faint washes, adjusting their features and colors.
- The overall texture and color tone of the image can be modified to fit the watercolor style.

### Step 2 - Preservation Targets List

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements include the woman's central positioning, her action of raising the glass, and the general setting. Functional/logical elements involve the context of a wine-tasting event, including the presence of wine glasses, papers, and tables. Remaining elements relate to the indoor setting and positioning, which must be coherent even in watercolor representation.

Preservation Targets List:  
- The woman's central positioning and her action of raising a glass.
- The presence of the wine glass and its contents.
- The indoor setting with tables and group activity.
- The papers and materials on the table.
- The general arrangement of the background figures.
