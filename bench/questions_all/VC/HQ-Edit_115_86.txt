**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a young ballerina captured in a classical ballet pose, viewed from the side with her body slightly turned toward the viewer. She is wearing a light pink tutu-style ballet costume with delicate embroidery along the bodice and hem, featuring floral patterns and subtle sparkle details. The bodice has thin spaghetti straps and a V-shaped neckline with a decorative green and blue embroidered motif at the center. Her hair is neatly styled into a tight bun at the back of her head, with bangs framing her forehead. She is en pointe on both feet, wearing pink satin pointe shoes with ribbons wrapped around her ankles. Her arms are gracefully positioned: the right arm raised above her head in a curved line, and the left arm extended outward to the side. The background is dark with a strong spotlight illuminating her from the upper right, creating a dramatic contrast and casting a soft shadow beneath her on the wooden stage floor. The flooring consists of polished wooden planks running horizontally, showing natural grain and warm tones.

Thinking process:  
The editing instructions specify transforming the image into a **cartoon style** with **exaggerated tutu designs**, using **soft pastel shades for the background**, adding **glitter accents to the costume**, and incorporating **blank spaces for messages** and **floral motifs on borders**. These changes indicate that:

- The **artistic style** (realistic → cartoon) is explicitly allowed to change.
- The **tutu design** can be exaggerated — implying proportions, volume, or shape may be altered.
- The **background color scheme** can be changed to soft pastels — so the current dark background is not required to remain.
- **Glitter accents** are to be added — meaning new decorative elements will be introduced.
- **Floral motifs** and **message areas** are to be added — indicating modifications to frame layout and composition.
- **No explicit mention** is made of preserving the **subject’s identity**, **pose**, **costume base structure**, or **facial features** — but since it's a transformation *of* the ballerina, her core form must still be recognizable.

Thus, based on the instruction language:
- **Allowed changes** include:
  - Artistic rendering (from realistic to cartoon)
  - Tutu volume and shape (exaggerated)
  - Background colors (changed to soft pastels)
  - Addition of glitter effects
  - Addition of floral borders and blank message areas
  - Style of lighting (can be softened or stylized)

**Allowed Changes List:**
- Artistic style (realistic → cartoon)
- Tutu size and shape (exaggerated)
- Background color and tone (dark → soft pastel)
- Addition of glitter accents on costume
- Addition of floral border motifs
- Addition of blank space for text/messages
- Lighting style (dramatic spotlight → softer, diffused cartoon lighting)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

Thinking process:  
To determine what must be retained, we apply exclusion based on the allowed changes:

**Core recognition elements:**  
Even though the image is being stylized, the subject is a **ballerina** performing a **ballet pose**. The **identity** of the figure as a ballerina hinges on several key visual markers:
- The **pointe shoes** (distinctive footwear used only in ballet)
- The **tutu** (specific silhouette associated with classical ballet)
- The **ballet posture** (en pointe stance, arm positions, turnout)
- The **hair bun** (typical hairstyle for classical ballet dancers)

These are essential to identify the character as a ballerina. Even if stylized, they must remain present and identifiable.

**Functional/logical association elements:**  
- The **relationship between the dancer and the stage floor**: she is standing on a wooden floor, which supports her weight in pointe position — this physical grounding is critical for believability and logical coherence in dance imagery.
- The **spatial orientation of the pose** (side profile, one leg forward, arms in fifth position): changing this would alter the dance move itself and undermine the integrity of the performance.

**Non-modified element deduction:**  
While the background and lighting can change, the **subject’s pose**, **footwear**, **hairstyle**, and **costume type** (even if exaggerated) must remain consistent with the original because:
- The instruction says “featuring the ballerina” — implying continuity of identity.
- No instruction allows replacing her with another character or removing her defining traits.
- The cartoon version must still represent the same person in the same dance role.

Therefore, despite stylistic changes, the following **must be preserved**:
- The **presence and form of pointe shoes**
- The **basic structure of the tutu** (even if exaggerated)
- The **hair bun and facial orientation**
- The **ballet pose** (including leg positioning and arm lines)
- The **wooden floor surface** (as a functional stage element)
- The **overall identity of the dancer** (young female, slender build, ballet attire)

**Preservation Targets List:**
- Presence and identification of pointe shoes
- Basic silhouette and structure of the tutu
- Hair bun with bangs
- Ballet pose (en pointe, arms in classical position)
- Wooden floor surface
- Facial orientation (looking upward and to the right)
- Costume color (pink base tone, even if enhanced)

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

Q1:  
Thinking process: The **pointe shoes** are the most definitive functional and symbolic element identifying the subject as a ballerina. They are not just footwear but an iconic part of ballet performance. Their presence and correct form (toes pointed, ribbons wrapped) are essential for recognition. If removed or replaced with regular shoes, the character would no longer be identifiable as a ballerina. Therefore, this is a core identity element with a weight of 3 points.  
Question: Are the pointe shoes visible and correctly positioned on the ballerina’s feet, with ribbons wrapped around the ankles?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3

Q2:  
Thinking process: The **tutu** is the signature garment of classical ballet. While its size can be exaggerated per instructions, its **basic structure** — a layered, flared skirt attached to a fitted bodice — must remain intact. Without this silhouette, the costume would lose its balletic identity. Thus, the tutu’s form is a core recognition feature, making it a 3-point element.  
Question: Is the ballerina wearing a tutu with a layered, flared skirt extending from the waist?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3

Q3:  
Thinking process: The **hair bun** is a standard requirement in classical ballet performances, especially for young dancers. It signifies discipline and professionalism. The specific detail of a **tight bun with bangs** is distinctive in this image and contributes to the subject’s identity. Altering or removing it would make the dancer appear unrecognizable in context. This is a key visual identifier, hence a 2-point element.  
Question: Does the ballerina have her hair styled in a tight bun at the back of her head with straight bangs across her forehead?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2

Q4:  
Thinking process: The **ballet pose** — specifically en pointe with one leg forward and arms in fifth position — defines the action and intent of the image. Changing this would transform the dance move and break the narrative of performance. Even in cartoon style, the pose must retain its structural essence. This is a functional and logical element critical to the scene’s coherence. Weight: 3.  
Question: Is the ballerina standing en pointe with one leg slightly behind and bent, and the other leg supporting her weight in a balanced position?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3

Q5:  
Thinking process: The **wooden floor** serves as the stage environment and provides spatial grounding. It is a real-world detail that anchors the performance. Although the background can be changed, the floor remains a necessary environmental element to maintain realism and logical consistency. Its texture and horizontal planks are distinct and should be preserved unless explicitly overridden. This is a secondary but important scene element. Weight: 2.  
Question: Is the ballerina standing on a wooden floor composed of horizontal planks with visible grain and warm brown tones?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2

Q6:  
Thinking process: The **facial orientation** — looking upward and to the right — is part of the emotional expression and choreographic intention. It aligns with the arm movement and creates a sense of aspiration. While facial features might be simplified in cartoon style, the direction of gaze must remain consistent to preserve the dynamic of the pose. This is a minor but coherent detail affecting overall balance. Weight: 1.  
Question: Is the ballerina’s head tilted upward and turned toward the right side of the image?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1

Q7:  
Thinking process: The **color of the tutu** — primarily pink — is a key visual attribute in the original image. While soft pastel shades may be added, the base pink hue is central to the costume’s identity. A drastic shift in color (e.g., to blue or yellow) would misrepresent the original. Though the instruction allows pastel tones, the original pink should remain dominant. This is a detail-level element influencing visual consistency. Weight: 1.  
Question: Is the tutu predominantly pink in color, with subtle embellishments?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1
