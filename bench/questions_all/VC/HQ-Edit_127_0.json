      "thinking_process": "The spotted owl’s facial disc and dark round eyes are core identification features. These distinguish it from other owl species and are essential for recognition. Even in a stylized illustration, these features must be preserved to ensure the subject remains identifiable as the same animal. Loss of the eye shape or facial symmetry would render the owl unrecognizable.",
      "question": "Is the owl's face clearly depicted with two large, dark, round eyes and a distinct facial disc?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The barred chest pattern and spotted wing markings are unique identifiers of the owl species. These patterns are not only visually distinctive but also biologically significant. Altering their arrangement or removing them entirely would misrepresent the owl’s appearance and undermine species accuracy, especially in an educational context.",
      "question": "Are the horizontal bars on the owl’s chest and the white spots on its wings visibly present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The owl’s posture—facing forward with head slightly tilted—is a defining compositional element of the original image. It conveys alertness and direct engagement with the viewer. Changing this posture significantly would alter the mood and focus of the scene, disrupting the intended connection between observer and subject.",
      "question": "Is the owl positioned facing forward with its head slightly turned toward the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The deeply grooved, layered bark texture of the tree branch is a key environmental detail that anchors the scene in realism and age. It provides tactile depth and supports the idea of an ancient tree. Removing or simplifying this texture would diminish the authenticity of the setting, especially in a botanical-style illustration meant to emphasize detail.",
      "question": "Does the tree branch display a deeply ridged and layered bark texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The moon’s position directly behind the owl creates a dramatic backlighting effect and serves as a focal point in the composition. Although it will be transformed into a diagram, its location relative to the owl must remain consistent to preserve the scene’s spatial logic and nocturnal theme.",
      "question": "Is the moon located directly behind the owl, centered in the upper portion of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The presence of greenish-yellow leaves extending from the upper branches frames the scene and adds depth to the canopy. These leaves contribute to the natural environment and help establish the setting as a forested area. While their color may shift slightly to match earthy tones, their shape and placement must remain to maintain environmental coherence.",
      "question": "Are there leafy branches visible in the upper corners of the image, forming a partial canopy around the owl?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
