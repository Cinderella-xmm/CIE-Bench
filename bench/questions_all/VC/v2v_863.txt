### Step 1 - Description of Reference Image:

The subject is an elephant depicted in a realistic style, standing upright with its trunk curved downward. The elephant has large ears, tusks, and a textured skin surface. Positioned prominently in the foreground, the elephant appears to be carrying a large, detailed globe on its back. The globe shows continents and oceans, with visible landmasses and cloud formations. The background consists of a soft, pastel-colored sky with subtle gradients and clouds, giving the image a serene and dreamlike quality.

### Thinking Process:

Analyzing the instructions, the elephant's form is to be transformed into a whimsical, stylized 3D chibi-style character while retaining its identifiable traits. The scene is to be replaced with a rustic kitchen countertop or market stall surrounded by lush greenery. The instructions do not specify retaining the original background or the globe, allowing these elements to be altered.

**Allowed Changes List:**
- The elephant's form can be changed to a chibi-style 3D rendering.
- The background can be replaced with a rustic kitchen or market stall.
- The globe can be removed or replaced with other elements reflecting environmental harmony.

### Step 2 - Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged:

**Thinking Process:**

**Core Recognition Elements:** The elephant's iconic features—such as its large ears, tusks, and trunk—must be retained even in the chibi-style transformation. These features are essential for recognizing the subject as an elephant.

**Functional/Logical Association Elements:** The elephant's posture and the action of carrying something heavy (even if the globe is replaced) should be preserved to maintain the narrative of strength and wisdom.

**Remaining Elements:** The texture and color of the elephant's skin, though simplified in a chibi style, should still convey its earthy tones. The serene and harmonious atmosphere should also be reflected in the new setting.

**Preservation Targets List:**
- Elephant's large ears, tusks, and trunk
- Elephant's posture and the action of carrying something heavy
- Earthy tones and texture of the elephant's skin
- Serene and harmonious atmosphere
