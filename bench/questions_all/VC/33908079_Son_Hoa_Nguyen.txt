**Step 1 – Analyze the editing instructions and determine allowed changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a woman in a tea plantation, bending forward to pick tea leaves. She has dark hair tied in a low ponytail, with some loose strands framing her face. Her posture is slightly crouched, leaning forward with her right hand reaching into the tea bushes. She wears an olive-green long-sleeved shirt, and a large white sack with orange trim and printed text is tied around her waist, positioned on her left side. The sack features a circular orange logo with a white stylized bird or rabbit-like figure inside it. The background consists of rows of lush green tea plants extending diagonally across the frame, forming a layered pattern due to the terrain’s slope. The lighting is natural daylight, casting soft shadows and highlighting the vibrant greenery.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction specifies several modifications: cartoonizing the worker slightly, enlarging her hands to emphasize tea picking, using vibrant green and earthy tones for the fields, adding gold foil to the sack's logo, incorporating vine-patterned borders, and presenting the final product as recycled paper postcards in an album. These indicate that:

- **Subject transformation**: The worker can be cartoonized (i.e., stylized), including facial features, proportions, and expressions.
- **Proportional change**: Hands are explicitly instructed to be enlarged — this is a permitted modification.
- **Color adjustment**: Fields may use more vibrant greens and earthy tones — color saturation and palette can be altered.
- **Texture/visual enhancement**: Gold foil effect on the sack’s logo is added — this changes the material appearance of the logo.
- **Border design**: Vine-patterned borders are introduced — these are new elements not present in the original.
- **Presentation format**: The image will be presented as postcards in a recycled paper album — this affects layout and medium but not necessarily content.

However, the instruction does **not** state that the identity of the worker, the action of tea picking, the sack’s presence, or the tea plantation setting should be removed or replaced. Therefore, while style and emphasis can shift, core visual components must remain recognizable.

**Allowed Changes List:**
- Cartoonization of the worker (including facial features, body proportions)
- Enlargement of hands
- Color enhancement of the tea field (vibrant greens and earthy tones)
- Addition of gold foil effect to the sack’s logo
- Introduction of vine-patterned borders
- Presentation format (postcard layout, recycled paper texture)

**Step 2 – Determine the elements that should remain unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
To preserve identity and logical consistency, we identify elements that cannot be changed without losing recognition or coherence:

1. **Core recognition elements**:
   - The **sack with the orange circle and white animal logo** is a distinctive visual marker. Even if stylized, its presence and basic form must be preserved because it identifies the worker as part of a specific agricultural operation and provides brand/contextual information.
   - The **tea-picking action** — the worker’s hand reaching into the tea bush — is central to the narrative. This functional gesture must remain intact to maintain the scene’s purpose.
   - The **position and orientation of the worker** — bending forward, facing down toward the plants — is essential to convey the act of harvesting. While proportions may change, the pose must remain logically consistent.

2. **Functional/logical association elements**:
   - The **worker’s interaction with the tea plants** — her hand touching the leaves — maintains the causal logic of tea harvesting. Removing or distorting this would break the narrative.
   - The **sack’s placement** — tied at the waist and hanging from the left side — is functionally important. It must remain attached to her body and visible to reflect real-world usage.

3. **Non-modified element deduction**:
   - The **overall environment** — rows of tea plants on a sloped hillside — must remain recognizable. Though colors may be enhanced, the layout and perspective should be retained.
   - The **worker’s clothing** — olive-green shirt — is a key identifier of her role and context. While stylized, the color and type of garment should remain identifiable.
   - The **hair style** — a low ponytail with loose strands — is a minor detail but contributes to realism and individuality. It may be simplified but not removed.

Thus, despite stylistic changes, the following must remain visually coherent and present:

**Preservation Targets List:**
- The sack with the orange circular logo and white animal figure
- The worker’s hand reaching into the tea leaves
- The worker’s bent-forward posture
- The tea plantation rows extending diagonally across the background
- The worker’s olive-green shirt
- The sack’s position tied at the waist on the left side
- The presence of tea plants in the foreground and background

**Step 3 – Generate yes/no questions based on key identifying visual elements**

Q1:  
Thinking process: The orange circular logo with the white animal figure is a unique identifier on the sack, distinguishing it from generic bags. Its presence is crucial for recognizing the branding and contextual authenticity of the worker’s equipment. If lost or replaced, the sack becomes indistinguishable, undermining the scene’s realism and identity. This is a core visual element with high recognition value.  
Question: Is the orange circular logo with the white animal figure clearly visible on the sack?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The worker’s hand reaching into the tea leaves is the central action of the image. It defines the activity and purpose of the scene. Without this gesture, the image loses its narrative function. Even if enlarged, the hand must still be engaged with the plants. This is a functional and narrative anchor.  
Question: Is the worker’s right hand visibly reaching into the tea bush to pick leaves?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The worker’s bent-forward posture is essential to depict the physical effort and method of tea picking. A straight or upright stance would contradict the activity. While proportions may change due to cartoonization, the overall lean must remain. This posture is critical for maintaining the action’s plausibility.  
Question: Is the worker leaning forward with her upper body angled downward toward the tea plants?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The sack is tied around the worker’s waist and hangs from the left side, which is a practical detail reflecting how harvesters carry their yield. Changing its position or removing it would disrupt the functional logic of the scene. Its location is a key spatial relationship.  
Question: Is the sack positioned on the left side of the worker’s waist and hanging downward?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The tea plantation’s layout — rows of green plants extending diagonally across the slope — establishes the environment and scale. While colors may be enhanced, the row structure and terrain slope must remain to preserve the setting’s identity. This is a key environmental feature.  
Question: Are the tea plants arranged in distinct diagonal rows across a sloped terrain?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The olive-green shirt worn by the worker is a defining feature of her attire and helps identify her as a laborer in this context. While cartoonization may simplify folds or shading, the color and long-sleeve shape must remain to maintain visual continuity. This is a secondary but identifiable detail.  
Question: Does the worker wear a long-sleeved olive-green shirt?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The worker’s dark hair tied in a low ponytail with loose strands is a personal detail contributing to her identity and realism. While cartoonization may soften edges, the hairstyle must remain recognizable to preserve the subject’s appearance. This is a minor but consistent trait.  
Question: Is the worker’s dark hair styled in a low ponytail with some loose strands near the face?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1
