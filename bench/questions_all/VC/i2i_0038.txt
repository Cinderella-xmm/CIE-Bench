Description of reference image: The subject is a person taking a selfie in a bathroom. The individual has shoulder-length brown hair, uneven bangs partially covering their eyes, and is smiling while holding a phone with a decorated case close to their face. They are wearing a black T-shirt featuring a graphic design, along with a necklace and wristbands. One hand is extended upward with an open palm in a friendly gesture. The background includes a wooden-framed mirror reflecting part of the room, a wooden shelf mounted above the sink, a white sink with a faucet, and some toiletries placed on it. The walls are clad with white tiles.

### Step 1 - Allowed Changes List:
- The person's pose and facial expression can be simplified into cartoon line art.
- The general form of the hand gesture, open mouth, and camera position may remain the same, but detailed features can be stylized.
- A speech bubble reading “Take a photo” can be added.

### Step 2 - Determining Elements That Should Remain Unchanged:
Thinking process: 
The core recognition elements here include the person's posture (raising a hand, holding a phone, and showing an open mouth), which define the action and intent even in a cartooned form. Functional/logical association elements include the person's interaction with the phone (holding it correctly to take a photo). Additional elements, such as the overall environment (bathroom setting with recognizable features like a mirror, sink, and shelf), assist in maintaining visual coherence.

Preservation Targets List:
- The raised hand, open mouth, and phone held near the face.
- The bathroom setting (mirror, sink, shelf, and visible toiletries).
- The person's black T-shirt and necklace as major clothing/accessory details.
- Positional relationship between the person and the background elements.
