Description of reference image: The image depicts a cozy living room with a large window framed by beige curtains, allowing natural light to illuminate the space. Two white armchairs with orange cushions are positioned facing each other, separated by a small round wooden table. On the windowsill, there's a black vase with dried flowers, a potted green plant, a few books, and two small terracotta pots. To the right of the window stands a tall indoor plant in a woven basket. A beige rug covers the wooden floor beneath the furniture.

Thinking process: Analyzing the editing instructions, only the black vase is to be replaced with a teapot and two porcelain cups added to the table. The rest of the scene's composition, including the armchairs, their positions, the window, the plants, and the general layout, remains unchanged.

Allowed Changes List:  
Specific element 1 that allows for changes:  
- The black vase is replaced with a teapot.  
- Two porcelain cups are added to the round wooden table.

### Step 2 - Determine the elements that should remain unchanged:

**Thinking process:**  
- **Core Recognition Elements:** The two white armchairs with orange cushions, the round wooden table, the large window with the beige curtains, and the indoor plant represent the scene's core identity and should be retained. Changing these would alter the basic setting and the intended cozy atmosphere.  
- **Functional/Logical Association Elements:** The placement of the armchairs relative to the table and window makes up a logical seating arrangement for conversation. The plants and books on the windowsill contribute to the room’s decor and should be preserved to maintain visual consistency.  
- **Remaining Elements:** Other details like the rug, wood flooring, and curtain rods add to the cozy aesthetic and should also remain consistent.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
(Element 1 that should be maintained: Position and style of the armchairs)  
(Element 2 that should be maintained: The round wooden table)  
(Element 3 that should be maintained: The large window and its framing by beige curtains)  
(Element 4 that should be maintained: The indoor plant and its placement)  
(Element 5 that should be maintained: The rug and wood flooring)
