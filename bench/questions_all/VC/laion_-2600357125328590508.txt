**Step 1 – Analyze the editing instructions and determine allowed changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a black athletic sock with knee-high length, featuring a prominent white "Under Armour" logo vertically aligned on the outer side of the calf. The sock has a textured knit pattern with distinct gray and white accents forming geometric shapes across the foot and shin areas. A small orange tag with a black Under Armour logo is located at the top edge of the cuff. The sock displays a reinforced heel and toe area in gray, with black horizontal stripes near the arch and a stylized "UA" logo on the ankle. The design includes subtle text along the lower leg, likely indicating product details or technology features. The background is plain white, with soft shadowing beneath the sock to suggest depth and positioning.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction explicitly states: *"Transform the sock into a sculptural piece made of LEGO bricks featuring dynamic black, gray, and white patterns."* This indicates that the **form of the subject (the sock)** will be changed from fabric to LEGO bricks—meaning its material, texture, and physical structure are permitted to change. However, it specifies: *"Retain the original patterns using blocky bricks,"* which means the **visual layout and design elements** must remain consistent.  

Additionally, it says: *"adding depth with layered construction for a 3D effect,"* implying spatial transformation but not altering the core visual content. It also mentions: *"integrate an orange LEGO piece for the tag,"* confirming that the **color and position of the tag** must be preserved in form, though material changes.  

The instruction further requires: *"Display it upright in a minimalist gallery setting,"* meaning the **scene environment is being replaced**, so the original plain white background is no longer required.  

Thus, the following elements are **allowed to change**:
- Material (from knit fabric to LEGO bricks)
- Texture (from smooth knit to blocky brick surface)
- Background (from plain white to minimalist gallery)
- Lighting and depth perception (to emphasize architectural detail)

**Allowed Changes List:**
- Subject material (fabric → LEGO bricks)
- Surface texture (knit → blocky brick)
- Background/environment (plain white → minimalist gallery)
- Lighting and shadow (adjusted for 3D sculptural effect)
- Physical construction (flat sock → layered, 3D LEGO sculpture)
- Positioning (upright display, possibly rotated for viewing)

**Step 2 – Determine the elements that should remain unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
We now identify what **must remain unchanged** based on the constraints in the instruction and the original image’s identity.

**Core recognition elements:**  
The sock's identity as an Under Armour product hinges on several key visual identifiers:
- The **"Under Armour" logo** in white, vertically oriented on the calf — this is a brand-defining feature.
- The **orange tag with black UA logo** at the top cuff — this is a signature branding element used across their products.
- The **distinctive color blocking**: black base with gray and white accents forming specific patterns (e.g., angular shapes on the foot, curved lines on the calf).
- The **position and shape of the "UA" logo** on the ankle — this is a recurring brand mark.

These are essential for brand recognition. Even if transformed into LEGO, these **patterns, colors, positions, and shapes** must be preserved to maintain identity.

**Functional/logical association elements:**  
There are no functional interactions in this image (e.g., no wearable action or mechanical function), but the **spatial layout of the design elements** must be preserved because they are part of the product’s visual language. For example, the logo placement and stripe alignment are intentional design choices tied to brand identity.

**Non-modified element deduction:**  
Although the material and texture may change, the **specific patterns, color zones, logo placements, and proportions** must stay intact. The instruction says "retain the original patterns using blocky bricks," which implies the **design blueprint remains unchanged**. Therefore, any unmentioned detail like the **small text on the lower leg**, **placement of the heel reinforcement**, or **shape of the toe cap** must be retained unless explicitly stated otherwise.

**Preservation Targets List:**
- Vertical white "Under Armour" logo on the calf
- Orange tag with black UA logo at the top cuff
- Gray and white geometric patterns on the foot and shin
- "UA" logo on the ankle
- Position and shape of the heel and toe reinforcements
- Color distribution (black base, gray accent zones, white highlights)
- Relative size and spacing of design elements

**Step 3 – Generate yes/no questions based on key identifying visual elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The vertical white "Under Armour" logo is the primary brand identifier on the sock. Its presence, orientation, and lettering style are critical for recognizing the product. If this logo is omitted, altered in spelling, or misaligned, the item would no longer be identifiable as an Under Armour sock. Therefore, preserving this exact logo in its original position and form is essential for core identity, assigning it a weight of 3 points.
    Question: Is the vertical white "Under Armour" logo clearly visible on the outer side of the calf, maintaining its original font, spacing, and orientation?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The orange tag with the black Under Armour logo at the top cuff is a distinctive brand feature. Its color and placement are consistent across Under Armour products. Changing its color, removing it, or relocating it would compromise brand authenticity. Since the instruction specifies integrating an orange LEGO piece for the tag, its existence and position must be preserved. This is a key identification point, hence a weight of 3 points.
    Question: Is there an orange tag with a black Under Armour logo located at the top edge of the sock cuff?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The "UA" logo on the ankle is a secondary but recognizable brand mark. Its placement and stylized form are consistent with Under Armour's design language. While not as dominant as the full name, its absence would reduce brand coherence. Since the instruction does not mention changing this, and it is part of the original pattern, it must be retained. This is a key accessory element, thus weighted at 2 points.
    Question: Is the stylized "UA" logo present on the ankle section of the sock?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The color scheme—black base with gray and white geometric patterns—is integral to the sock’s design identity. The instruction specifies retaining the original patterns, which implies the color zones must remain unchanged. Altering the color distribution (e.g., swapping gray for blue) would break visual consistency. This is a major design element affecting recognition, so it receives a weight of 2 points.
    Question: Are the gray and white geometric patterns on the foot and shin area preserved in their original positions and color scheme?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The reinforced heel and toe areas are functional design features that also contribute to visual identity. Their shape and color (gray) distinguish them from the rest of the sock. Although not branded, they are part of the original pattern and help define the sock’s structure. The instruction requires retaining the original patterns, so these structural elements must be preserved. This is a detail-level but important consistency element, assigned 1 point.
    Question: Are the gray reinforced sections on the heel and toe maintained in their original shape and location?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The small text printed along the lower leg (likely product information) is a minor but present detail in the original image. While not central to brand identity, it contributes to the authenticity of the product representation. Since the instruction does not specify removing it and it is part of the original pattern, it should be preserved. This is a low-weight detail, so it receives 1 point.
    Question: Is the small text printed vertically along the lower leg of the sock still visible and in its original position?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}
