      "thinking_process": "The intricate engraved floral and scrollwork pattern on the teapot body is the most defining artistic feature. Its presence and specific layout (symmetrical central motif with radiating swirls) are critical to identifying the teapot as a historically inspired, ornamental object. If these engravings are removed or simplified beyond recognition, the object loses its core visual identity. This makes it a core identification element, hence weighted at 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the intricate engraved floral and scrollwork pattern on the teapot body still visible and intact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The rounded body shape with flared base and domed lid is the structural signature of the teapot. Altering this silhouette would fundamentally change the objectâ€™s identity from a classic teapot to something else entirely. Even with added branding, the basic form must remain recognizable. This is a core structural element, thus assigned 3 points.",
      "question": "Does the teapot retain its rounded body, flared base, and domed lid with finial?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The reflective silver-metallic finish is crucial to conveying the material quality and luxurious feel of the object. While lighting may vary, the surface must still reflect light and show highlights consistent with polished metal. Loss of this finish would make the object appear dull or non-metallic, undermining its original character. This is a key material attribute, therefore worth 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the reflective silver-metallic surface of the teapot preserved, showing clear highlights and reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The position and curvature of the spout and both handles are functionally significant. The spout curves outward for pouring, and the handles are placed for ergonomic use. Changing their positions or shapes would disrupt the logical design of the teapot, making it appear malformed or unusable. These are important functional elements, so they are weighted at 2 points.",
      "question": "Are the spout and both handles positioned and shaped as in the original image, maintaining their curved forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The decorative ridge and edge banding around the lid and base are fine details that enhance the ornamental quality. Though secondary, they contribute to the overall craftsmanship and visual harmony. Removing them would simplify the design too much, affecting coherence. These are minor but meaningful details, thus assigned 1 point.",
      "question": "Are the decorative ridges and edge banding around the lid and base still present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
