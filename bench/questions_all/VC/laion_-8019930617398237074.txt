Description of reference image: The subject is a woman standing in profile, facing right, wearing an elegant white wedding gown. The gown features a high neckline and long sleeves with intricate lace detailing on the bodice and upper arms. The skirt is made of smooth, flowing fabric that drapes to the floor, creating a soft A-line silhouette. Attached to the left side of the dress is a sheer lace panel extending from the shoulder down into a train, which appears to be part of the sleeve or an integrated capelet. The woman has her hair styled in an updo adorned with a floral crown composed of light pink and cream-colored flowers. She wears a translucent veil that extends from the back of her head, blending subtly with the lace elements. Her hands are gently clasped in front of her at waist level. The background is a plain, evenly lit white studio setting, emphasizing the purity and simplicity of the bridal attire.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions word by word: "Convert the woman in white gown into a romantic postcard" — this indicates a transformation of style and presentation but not necessarily the core identity of the subject. "Stylize with asymmetrical floral patterns and pastel lace overlay" — these are new visual layers applied over the original image; thus, they are allowed changes. "Adjust her pose to appear gently holding a bouquet" — this directly alters the posture and hand position, so the current hand-clasping pose is no longer required. "Utilize watercolor techniques in light pink and cream" — this describes a stylistic treatment affecting color and texture, allowing modification of rendering method. "Present the postcard with embossed edges and place in a delicate paper sleeve" — this refers to framing and presentation format, meaning the final output will be a framed postcard-like object, not just the image itself. Therefore, the scene (studio backdrop) and presentation format can change. However, any element not explicitly mentioned as changed must be assessed for whether it's essential to the original identity.

Allowed Changes List:
- Pose adjustment (hands now holding bouquet)
- Addition of asymmetrical floral patterns
- Application of pastel lace overlay
- Watercolor rendering technique using light pink and cream
- Embossed edges and paper sleeve presentation
- Background transformation due to postcard framing

Step 2 – Determine the elements that should remain unchanged  
Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements: The identity of the subject as a bride in a specific gown design hinges on key visual markers. The most critical is the **white gown with lace bodice and long sleeves**, particularly the **intricate lace pattern on the upper body and sleeves**. This is not merely decorative—it defines the garment’s character. Similarly, the **floral crown** atop her head is a distinctive accessory that identifies her bridal status and aesthetic. These elements are central to recognizing the subject as a bride in this particular style. If replaced or obscured, the core identity shifts.  

Functional/logical association elements: The **veil attached to the back of her head** is functionally linked to the hairstyle and serves as a traditional bridal accessory. Its presence maintains logical consistency with bridal attire. Although the instruction allows stylization, the veil’s existence and attachment point must be preserved unless explicitly removed.  

Non-modified element deduction: Elements such as the **texture of the lace**, **the shape of the floral crown**, **the silhouette of the dress**, and **the positioning of the lace panel extending from the shoulder** are not mentioned in the instructions as being altered. While the overall style may be softened via watercolor, the underlying structure of these components must remain recognizable. For example, even if rendered in watercolor, the lace pattern must still be visible as lace—its form cannot be erased or fundamentally transformed into something else like embroidery or solid fabric. The same applies to the floral crown: its flower shapes and placement must remain identifiable.  

Preservation Targets List:  
- The lace pattern on the bodice and sleeves of the gown  
- The floral crown on the woman’s head  
- The veil attached to the back of her head  
- The shape and flow of the lace panel extending from the shoulder into a train  
- The silhouette of the white A-line wedding dress  
- The overall white color scheme of the gown (though tones may shift slightly with watercolor effect)  

Q1:  
Thinking process: The lace pattern on the bodice and sleeves is a defining feature of the gown’s design. It distinguishes this dress from others and contributes significantly to its elegance and identity. Losing this detail would make the gown appear plain or generic, undermining its unique visual signature. Since the instruction mentions adding a "pastel lace overlay," this implies the original lace must still be present beneath or alongside it, not replaced. Thus, the presence and structure of the original lace pattern must be retained.  
Question: Is the lace pattern visible on the bodice and long sleeves of the gown?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The floral crown is a key accessory that identifies the subject as a bride and adds a romantic, natural element to her appearance. Its specific composition—light pink and cream flowers arranged in a circular band—is visually distinct. Even with stylization, the crown must remain recognizable as a floral headpiece in the same location and general form. Changing its type (e.g., to a tiara) or removing it would alter the subject’s identity.  
Question: Is a floral crown made of light pink and cream flowers positioned on top of the woman’s head?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The veil is traditionally attached to the back of the head and flows downward, often blending with other elements like lace. In this image, it is clearly visible as a translucent layer extending from behind her head. Though the instruction allows for artistic rendering, the veil’s presence and connection point must be preserved to maintain the bridal context. Removing or relocating it would disrupt the authenticity of the bridal look.  
Question: Is a translucent veil attached to the back of the woman’s head and extending downward?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The lace panel extending from the left shoulder into a train is a unique structural element of the dress. It creates asymmetry and visual interest, distinguishing this gown from standard designs. Even if overlaid with new patterns, the original shape and flow of this panel must remain intact. Altering its path or removing it would change the dress’s silhouette and identity.  
Question: Is there a sheer lace panel extending from the left shoulder down into a train?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The A-line silhouette of the dress, characterized by a fitted bodice and gradually flaring skirt, is a core design feature. This shape is essential to identifying the dress type and maintaining its elegance. While the rendering may soften with watercolor, the overall outline must remain consistent. Changing the silhouette (e.g., to mermaid or ballgown) would fundamentally alter the dress’s identity.  
Question: Does the dress have an A-line silhouette with a fitted bodice and flared skirt?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The white color of the gown is central to its identity as a bridal dress. While the instruction allows watercolor effects in light pink and cream, the base color must remain predominantly white. Any significant deviation (e.g., shifting to off-white or ivory) could affect recognition, especially if contrasted against the added colors. The original white tone must be preserved as the foundation.  
Question: Is the gown primarily white in color?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
