      "thinking_process": "The chevron quilting pattern is the most prominent design feature of the bag, distinguishing it from other styles. Its V-shaped stitching creates a unique visual rhythm that defines the bag’s identity. Even when transformed into line art, the **pattern must retain its geometric structure and directionality** to ensure recognition. Losing this would fundamentally alter the bag’s visual signature. Therefore, preserving the chevron pattern’s layout and orientation is critical for identity retention.",
      "question": "Is the chevron quilting pattern present on the front panel of the bag, forming a series of diagonal V-shapes?",

      "thinking_process": "The gold zippers are not only functional but serve as a key branding cue due to their color contrast against the olive green. Their **placement—horizontal across the front pocket and vertical along the sides—is essential** for maintaining the bag’s structural logic. Changing their position or omitting them would misrepresent the product’s design.",
      "question": "Are there gold-colored zippers located horizontally across the front pocket and vertically along the side panels of the bag?",

      "thinking_process": "The \"REACTION\" brand plaque is a core identity marker. Its presence, size, and central placement above the front zipper make it a non-negotiable element for brand recognition. Removing or relocating it would render the product unidentifiable as part of the Reaction collection.",
      "question": "Is the brand plaque with the word \"REACTION\" in white capital letters on a black background positioned centrally above the front horizontal zipper?",

      "thinking_process": "The black top handles are integral to the bag’s function and silhouette. Their **curved shape and attachment to the upper edge** define how the bag is carried. While they may be rendered in line art, their **form and connection points must be preserved** to maintain structural accuracy.",
      "question": "Are there two black curved handles attached at the top of the bag, secured with gold-tone hardware?",

Its **connection points on either side** and **length** are important for understanding the bag’s versatility. Even in a postcard format, these elements must be accurately represented to preserve functionality cues.",
      "question": "Is there a black shoulder strap attached to the sides of the bag via gold-tone D-rings?",

      "thinking_process": "The overall rectangular silhouette with rounded corners is fundamental to the bag’s identity. Altering its proportions or shape would make it unrecognizable as the same model. Even in minimalist line art, the **basic outline must match the original** to maintain product fidelity.",

      "thinking_process": "The relative positions of the zippers, handles, and plaque create a coherent design language. Misplacing any component disrupts visual logic. For example, moving the plaque below the zipper would break brand consistency. Thus, **spatial relationships must be preserved**.",
