Description of reference image: The image shows three individuals standing in front of a snow-covered log cabin. They are dressed in winter attire, including jackets, hats, gloves, and ski poles. The man in the center wears a red hat and a yellow jacket, while the two women wear blue and green jackets respectively. All three are smiling and appear ready for outdoor activities. The log cabin behind them has a rustic appearance with visible logs and a snow-covered roof.

### Step 1 - Allowed Changes List:

Specific element 1 that allows for changes:  
- Increase the size of the heads relative to the bodies to create a bobblehead effect.  
- Modify the bodies to give them a cartoonish appearance.  
- Adjust the scale of the log cabin to make it smaller in relation to the subjects.  

### Step 2 - Preservation Targets List:

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements include the distinct winter clothing, facial features, and accessories (e.g., hats, glasses). Functional/logical elements include the positioning of the individuals in front of the cabin and the presence of ski poles. Remaining elements like the cabin's rustic texture and the snowy environment contribute to visual coherence.

Preservation Targets List:  
(Element 1 that should be maintained: Facial features and accessories)  
(Element 2 that should be maintained: Winter clothing colors and styles)  
(Element 3 that should be maintained: Position of individuals in front of the cabin)  
(Element 4 that should be maintained: Presence of ski poles)  
(Element 5 that should be maintained: Rustic texture of the log cabin)
