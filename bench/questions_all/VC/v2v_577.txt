Description of reference image: The subject is a woman with shoulder-length wavy dark brown hair, seated at a wooden desk in an indoor office environment. She is wearing a light blue long-sleeved button-up shirt with a visible chest pocket on the left side and white buttons running down the front. Her posture is upright, facing slightly to her right, with her hands positioned on the keyboard of a silver laptop placed directly in front of her. The laptop has a matte finish and is open at a standard viewing angle. On the desk, to the right of the laptop, there is a small stack of white paper or notepad. In the background, to the left, a potted plant with broad green leaves sits on a low wooden shelf. To the right, a tall bookshelf with vertical rows of books (in neutral tones) is partially visible. The wall behind her is plain and light beige, contributing to a calm and professional atmosphere. The lighting is soft and even, suggesting natural daylight from an unseen window.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions for explicit transformations. The instruction states to "reimagine the subject as a classic LEGO-style minifigure," which means the human form, facial features, clothing texture, and physical proportions are to be transformed into stylized LEGO elements. The scene is also to be reimagined: the original office setting is replaced by a transparent glass cube with a matte black base and silver detailing, containing a compact desk and laptop. A LEGO-style cat is introduced next to the figure. The background gradient is specified as transitioning from dark gray to light beige, replacing the original neutral wall and furniture. The nameplate “Cerulean Cat” and biological classification text are new additions. Therefore, all original environmental elements—such as the real-world desk, chair, bookshelf, plant, and wall—are not required to be preserved. However, the instruction does not mention changing the subject’s core identity attributes such as gender, hairstyle, clothing color, or professional demeanor, which must be retained in the stylized form. The transformation is stylistic, not identity-altering. Thus, only those visual traits that define the subject’s identity and context in the original image are candidates for retention, even if stylized.

Allowed Changes List:
- Subject's physical form (transformed into LEGO minifigure)
- Facial features (stylized into blocky LEGO face)
- Hair texture and flow (replaced with LEGO-style hair piece)
- Clothing material and fabric details (replaced with smooth LEGO plastic texture)
- Desk and chair (replaced with compact LEGO desk and chair)
- Laptop design (replaced with LEGO-style laptop)
- Background elements (plant, bookshelf, wall) — removed or replaced
- Lighting style (adjusted to highlight craftsmanship)
- Overall composition (restructured into vertical format with glass cube)

Step 2 - Determine the elements that should remain unchanged

Thinking process:
Core recognition elements: The subject’s identity is defined by specific visual markers that distinguish her from others. These include her dark brown wavy hair, the light blue color of her shirt, the presence of a chest pocket on the left side, and the fact that she is engaged in typing on a laptop. These are key identifiers of her appearance and activity. Even though the form is changed to LEGO, the instruction implies retaining her identity through these features. For example, the light blue shirt is explicitly referenced in the instruction (“light blue color palette that complements the subject's attire”), so its color must be preserved. Similarly, the act of working on a laptop is central to her professional demeanor and must be retained in function, even if stylized.

Functional/logical association elements: The interaction between the subject and the laptop is essential to the narrative of professionalism and focus. The positioning of her hands on the keyboard indicates active use, which must be preserved in the LEGO version. This functional relationship ensures logical coherence: a minifigure must still appear to be using the laptop. Additionally, the presence of a cat reflecting her calm demeanor suggests a thematic continuity, but the cat is a new element, not derived from the original.

Non modified element deduction: After excluding all elements allowed to change (form, texture, background), the remaining unmentioned but visually present features in the original image that contribute to identity must be retained. These include the color of the shirt, the position of the pocket, the length and wave pattern of the hair, and the orientation of the subject relative to the laptop. These are not explicitly mentioned in the instruction as changeable, and their absence would disrupt the fidelity of the transformation.

Preservation Targets List:
- The subject’s dark brown wavy hair
- The light blue color of the shirt
- The presence of a chest pocket on the left side of the shirt
- The subject’s hands positioned on the laptop keyboard
- The subject’s forward-facing posture with slight turn toward the laptop
- The overall professional and calm demeanor conveyed through expression and posture

Q1:  
Thinking process: The dark brown wavy hair is a core identification feature of the subject. Its color and texture are distinctive and help differentiate her from other individuals. Although the instruction allows for transformation into a LEGO-style hairpiece, the instruction specifies that the subject’s calm and professional demeanor should be reflected, which includes the hair’s length and style. The hair’s wavy nature and dark brown color are essential to maintaining her identity. Losing this would result in a misrepresentation of the original subject. Therefore, the presence and color of the hair must be preserved in the stylized form.

Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The light blue color of the shirt is explicitly referenced in the instruction as part of the color palette to be used in the LEGO design. This indicates that the shirt’s color is a key attribute to retain. It serves as a visual anchor linking the original and edited versions. Changing the color would break the thematic consistency and could lead to misidentification of the subject. The color is not just decorative but tied to the subject’s identity and the aesthetic direction of the edit.

Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The chest pocket on the left side of the shirt is a specific detail that contributes to the subject’s visual identity. It is a unique structural feature that distinguishes her attire from generic shirts. While the instruction allows for stylization, it does not permit removal of defining clothing elements. Retaining the pocket ensures that the LEGO version remains faithful to the original subject’s outfit. Its absence would make the shirt appear generic and reduce visual accuracy.

Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes

Q4:  
Thinking process: The subject’s hands are positioned on the laptop keyboard, indicating active engagement with the device. This functional interaction is central to the scene’s narrative of professionalism. The instruction requires the subject to be seated at a desk with a laptop, implying that the action of typing must be preserved. Even in LEGO form, the hands must be shown in contact with the keyboard to maintain logical coherence. Removing or altering this would undermine the purpose of the scene.
Question: Are the subject's hands positioned on the laptop keyboard in the edited image?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The subject’s posture—upright, facing slightly to her right, with her head turned toward the laptop—is a key aspect of her demeanor. This orientation conveys focus and professionalism. The instruction emphasizes a calm and professional demeanor, which is expressed through body language. Altering the posture would change the emotional tone and misrepresent the original intent. Therefore, the directional orientation and forward-facing stance must be preserved.
Question: Is the subject facing slightly to her right with her head turned toward the laptop in the edited image?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The presence of a laptop is a core functional element in the scene. The instruction specifies a compact desk with a laptop, confirming that the device must be included. While the laptop may be stylized, its presence is essential to the subject’s activity. Without it, the scene loses its context and purpose. The laptop is not just a background object but a key prop in the narrative of work and focus.
Question: Is there a laptop present in front of the subject in the edited image?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
