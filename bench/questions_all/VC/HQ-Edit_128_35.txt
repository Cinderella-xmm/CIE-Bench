**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a vintage black typewriter placed centrally on a polished wooden table with visible grain patterns. The typewriter has a classic design, featuring a curved carriage, two side-mounted knobs (one for paper feed and one for platen adjustment), a lever on the left side, and a full QWERTY keyboard with round silver keys arranged in rows. A sheet of white paper is inserted into the typewriter, displaying typed text in a standard serif font, aligned to the left. The body of the typewriter is glossy black plastic or enamel-coated metal, with a semi-circular central area containing radial lines resembling a fan-like pattern beneath the carriage. The brand name "Underwood" is faintly visible along the curved edge of this central section. The wooden table has a rich brown tone, smooth finish, and distinct wood grain running diagonally across the surface. The lighting is soft and directional, casting subtle shadows beneath the typewriter, enhancing depth and texture. The background is neutral gray, out of focus, ensuring attention remains on the typewriter and table.

**Thinking process:**  
First, analyze the editing instructions word by word:  
- *"Transform the typewriter into a vintage-themed notebook cover"* → This explicitly changes the **form and function** of the typewriter; it is no longer a functional machine but becomes a **decorative object** (a notebook cover). Thus, the **physical structure** of the typewriter as a working device can be altered.
- *"Incorporate a retro font for the title 'Tales Untold' across the top half"* → This adds new textual content; the original text on the paper may be replaced or obscured.
- *"Add decorative elements: faded ink splatters and parchment textures"* → These are new visual layers; they can overlay or replace existing textures.
- *"Replace the wooden table with a marbled background"* → The scene/environment is explicitly changed; therefore, the **table** and its **wooden texture** are not required to be retained.
- *"Include a leather spine with subtle embossed icons of typewriter keys"* → This introduces a **new structural element** (spine) and **embossed details**, which are not present in the original.

From this analysis, we identify that:
- The **typewriter’s physical form** is being transformed into a **notebook cover**, so its **functional components** (e.g., moving parts, carriage, platen) may be stylized or reimagined.
- The **paper with typed text** is likely to be modified or covered by the new title and textures.
- The **wooden table** is replaced entirely, so it is not preserved.
- However, **iconic visual features** of the typewriter — such as its shape, key layout, brand name, and distinctive design — must be preserved if they are used as **design motifs** in the new notebook cover.

Thus, only those **visual characteristics** of the typewriter that are **essential to its identity** and **not explicitly altered** in the instruction should be considered for retention.

---

**Allowed Changes List:**
- The overall form and function of the typewriter (transformed into a notebook cover)
- The presence and content of the paper (replaced with title and textures)
- The wooden table (replaced with marbled background)
- The addition of new elements: retro font, ink splatters, parchment texture, leather spine, embossed keys
- The lighting and shadowing (can change due to new background and object transformation)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
Now, we apply exclusion based on the allowed changes:

**Core recognition elements:**  
The typewriter is a specific model with identifiable design traits. Even though it is being transformed into a notebook cover, **its iconic silhouette and key features** must be preserved to maintain **visual fidelity** and **identity continuity**. For example:
- The **distinctive curved carriage** is a hallmark of early Underwood typewriters.
- The **arrangement of keys** (QWERTY layout) and **round silver key caps** are signature features.
- The **brand name "Underwood"** inscribed on the front plate is a core identifier.
- The **radial fan-like pattern** under the carriage is a unique aesthetic feature.
- The **side knobs and left lever** contribute to the typewriter's mechanical identity.

These features are **not mentioned as being removed or altered** in the instruction — instead, they are likely to be **replicated or stylized** in the notebook design. Therefore, their **presence and basic form** must be retained, even if stylized.

**Functional/logical association elements:**  
Although the typewriter will no longer function mechanically, its **structural logic** (e.g., keyboard placement relative to carriage) should remain consistent to preserve **recognizability**. For instance, the keyboard must still appear below the carriage, and the keys must retain their general arrangement. Changing this would make the design unrecognizable as a typewriter-derived motif.

**Non-modified element deduction:**  
After excluding all explicitly changed elements (table, paper, function), the remaining **visual details** of the typewriter — such as **key shapes**, **brand text**, **carriage curvature**, **platen roller**, and **side mechanisms** — must be retained in some form, especially since the instruction asks to **"incorporate"** the typewriter into the design. The phrase “vintage-themed notebook cover” implies **stylized preservation** of the original object.

Therefore, the following **core visual elements** of the typewriter must be preserved:

---

**Preservation Targets List:**
- The **overall silhouette** of the typewriter (including curved carriage, keyboard base, and side extensions)
- The **QWERTY keyboard layout** with round silver key caps
- The **brand name "Underwood"** visible on the front panel
- The **radial fan-like pattern** beneath the carriage
- The **position and shape of the side knobs and left lever**
- The **curved platen roller** and paper guide mechanism
- The **glossy black finish** of the typewriter body (as a color cue for authenticity)

Note: While the **wooden table** is replaced, the **typewriter’s position** on a flat surface is implied in the new design (on a notebook), so spatial orientation is preserved logically.

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The curved carriage is a defining architectural feature of the Underwood typewriter, distinguishing it from other models. Its absence would make the object unrecognizable as a typewriter. Since the instruction transforms the typewriter into a notebook cover, the curve must be preserved in form to maintain identity. This is a core identity feature, hence weight 3.
    Question: Is the curved carriage of the typewriter present and accurately shaped?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The QWERTY keyboard layout with round silver key caps is essential to the typewriter’s identity. Even in a stylized version, the arrangement and circular shape of keys must be retained to ensure recognizability. Altering this would break the functional logic of the typewriter. This is a core functional and visual element, thus weight 3.
    Question: Are the round silver key caps arranged in a QWERTY layout?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The brand name "Underwood" is a key identifier of the typewriter model. Its presence ensures authenticity and historical accuracy. Although the instruction allows for decorative additions, the brand name must remain legible or at least recognizable in the design. Losing it would remove a critical identity marker. Hence, weight 3.
    Question: Is the brand name "Underwood" visible on the front panel of the typewriter?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The radial fan-like pattern beneath the carriage is a unique aesthetic detail of this typewriter model. It contributes to its visual identity and is not a common feature in other machines. Preserving it maintains stylistic fidelity. Though not functional, it is an iconic design element. Weight assigned as 2 due to importance in recognition but less than core functional features.
    Question: Is the radial fan-like pattern beneath the carriage present?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The side knobs and left lever are mechanical components that define the typewriter’s operation. Their presence indicates the object’s original function. Even in a stylized notebook cover, these elements should be represented to maintain coherence with the source object. They are important design cues, hence weight 2.
    Question: Are the side knobs and left lever present on the typewriter?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The glossy black finish is a key material attribute that distinguishes this typewriter from others. It contributes to the vintage aesthetic and is part of the original design. While colors might be slightly adjusted in a stylized version, the dominant black color must be retained to preserve authenticity. This is a secondary but important detail, so weight 1.
    Question: Is the typewriter body predominantly glossy black?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}
{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The platen roller is a functional component essential to the typewriter’s operation. Its cylindrical shape and position above the keyboard are critical to recognition. Even if stylized, it must remain visible to maintain logical consistency. This is a minor but necessary detail for mechanical integrity. Weight 1.
    Question: Is the platen roller visible above the keyboard?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
