Description of reference image: The subject consists of two distinct birds positioned side by side in a diptych format. On the left, a bird with a pale gray head, black eye stripe extending from the beak to behind the eye, and a light beige underbelly stands on a rough, textured rock surface. Its wings are dark brown with subtle barring, and its legs are thin and black. The bird's beak is short, pointed, and slightly open, revealing a hint of the interior. It faces slightly to the right, with its head turned toward the viewer. On the right, a second bird displays a stark contrast: a white crown, black face and upper body, and white patches on the wings and rump. Its tail is black with white tips, and it stands on a similar rocky surface, facing left with its back partially turned to the viewer. Both birds are perched on natural stone surfaces with visible granular textures and lichen-like patterns. The background of each panel is softly blurred—left showing muted earthy tones and rocks, right showing a smooth gradient from warm yellow to soft gray—emphasizing the birds as focal points. The lighting is natural, suggesting daylight, with soft shadows defining form and depth.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions that explicitly transform the birds into non-natural forms: "Transform the bird on the left into an animated origami figure meticulously folded from ancient star charts" — this allows complete transformation of the bird’s physical form, texture, and material, including coloration and structure. Similarly, "the bird on the right into a luminous crystalline structure resembling an avian form" — this permits full reimagining of shape, material, and appearance. The instruction also specifies new perches: "colossal, intricately carved ivory chess rooks" — thus replacing the original rocks. The scene is changed entirely: "set within a vast, surreal library where books drift like silent birds through aisles receding into impossible geometries" — indicating the background and environment are fully replaceable. Therefore, all elements related to the birds’ biological form, feather texture, coloration, posture, and the natural rock perches are allowed to change. However, the **positioning** of the birds (left vs. right), their **relative orientation** (one facing forward-left, one facing backward-right), and the **diptych layout** (two separate panels) are not mentioned for modification and must be preserved unless explicitly altered. Additionally, the **presence of two birds**, their **distinct visual identities** (as different species), and the **rocky perch texture** (though replaced, the concept of a solid base beneath them may be retained in form if not specified otherwise) are implied to be foundational to the composition. But since the instruction replaces both birds and their perches, only structural layout and spatial relationships not contradicted by the edit are preserved.

Allowed Changes List:
- The form, texture, and material of the bird on the left (transformed into origami from star charts)
- The form, texture, and material of the bird on the right (transformed into crystalline structure)
- The perch beneath each bird (replaced with colossal ivory chess rooks)
- The background environment (replaced with surreal library)
- The coloration, feather pattern, and anatomical details of both birds
- The lighting and atmospheric conditions

Step 2- Determine the elements that should remain unchanged  
Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements: Although the birds themselves are to be transformed, their **original identity as two distinct avian subjects** is essential to the narrative of the edit. The instruction does not remove or merge them; instead, it transforms each individually. Thus, the **existence of two birds**, one on the left and one on the right, must be preserved. Their **spatial separation** in a diptych format is critical to maintaining the original composition’s structure. This layout is not mentioned for change, so it must remain. Furthermore, the **relative orientation** of each bird—left bird facing forward with head turned, right bird in profile with back partially visible—is not specified to be altered, so these postures must be preserved in the transformed versions. These are core to identifying the edited image as a transformation of the original, not a replacement.

Functional/logical association elements: The **perching action** of each bird on a solid surface is functionally necessary. Even though the perch changes, the **act of standing on a support** must be maintained. The **position of the feet** relative to the perch (e.g., claws gripping) is a functional detail that supports the realism of the pose and should be preserved in the transformed version. The **diptych format** implies a deliberate comparison between the two birds, which is a logical structure of the original image. If this format were lost, the intended juxtaposition would be disrupted.

Non modified element deduction: After excluding all elements allowed to change (bird anatomy, color, texture, perch material, background), the remaining unmentioned but visually present elements include:  
- The **two-panel layout** (diptych)  
- The **relative positioning** of the birds (left/right)  
- The **orientation of each bird** (head direction, body angle)  
- The **presence of feet and claws** in contact with a surface  
- The **general silhouette** of each bird (not necessarily shape, but overall outline and stance)  

These are not explicitly changed by the instruction and are essential for coherence. They are not core identity features of the birds themselves (since those are being replaced), but they are structural and compositional anchors that preserve the original image’s logic.

Preservation Targets List:  
- The diptych format (two separate panels)  
- The left bird positioned on the left panel, right bird on the right panel  
- The left bird facing forward with head turned slightly to the right  
- The right bird in profile, facing left with back partially visible  
- The presence of feet and claws gripping a surface beneath each bird  
- The general silhouette and stance of each bird (upright, balanced)  

Q1:  
Thinking process: The diptych format is a fundamental structural feature of the original image, dividing the composition into two distinct panels. This layout is not mentioned in the editing instruction as something to be altered, and removing it would fundamentally change the image’s organization. The presence of two separate panels is a key visual element that defines the relationship between the two birds. Losing this would make the image appear as a single scene rather than a comparative pair, undermining the original intent. Therefore, preserving the two-panel structure is essential for visual consistency and is a core compositional element.  
Question: Is the image composed of two separate panels, with one bird on the left and one on the right?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The position of the birds—left bird on the left panel, right bird on the right panel—is a core spatial arrangement that must be preserved. The instruction does not suggest swapping or merging the birds, nor does it imply a change in their lateral placement. Reversing or combining them would disrupt the original composition’s balance and intent. This positional relationship is a key identifier of the image’s structure and must remain unchanged.  
Question: Is the bird that was originally on the left still located in the left panel, and the bird that was originally on the right still located in the right panel?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The orientation of the left bird—facing forward with its head turned slightly to the right—is a distinctive pose that contributes to its identity in the original image. The instruction does not specify changing this posture, only transforming its form. Therefore, the transformed origami bird must maintain this same head turn and forward-facing stance to preserve the original’s visual logic. This orientation is a key detail that distinguishes it from the other bird and must be retained.  
Question: Does the bird on the left have its head turned toward the viewer, with its beak slightly open and facing forward?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The right bird’s profile view, with its back partially visible and facing left, is a defining characteristic of its original pose. The instruction does not alter this orientation, only the material and form. Preserving this angle ensures continuity in the visual narrative. The transformed crystalline bird must retain this same side profile to maintain consistency with the original. This is a key relational element between the two birds and must be preserved.  
Question: Does the bird on the right have its body angled such that its back is partially visible and it is facing left?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The presence of feet and claws gripping a surface is a functional detail that supports the birds’ perching action. Even though the perch itself is replaced, the act of standing on a support must be preserved. The original image shows clear claw grips on the rock, and this interaction must be maintained in the transformed version to ensure logical coherence. Losing this would make the birds appear floating or unsupported, breaking the physical logic of the scene.  
Question: Are the feet of both birds clearly shown gripping a surface beneath them?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The general silhouette of each bird—upright, balanced, with a defined head, body, and tail—is a secondary but important detail that helps maintain the avian form even after transformation. While the internal structure changes, the outer shape must remain recognizable as a bird in stance. This silhouette is not explicitly changed by the instruction and is necessary for visual coherence. It is a minor but consistent feature that aids in identifying the transformed figures as derived from the original.  
Question: Do both birds maintain an upright, balanced silhouette with a distinct head, body, and tail?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
