Description of reference image: The subject consists of a white plastic cookie cutter shaped like an atom model and a circular piece of light brown dough with the same atomic design imprinted into it. The cookie cutter is positioned to the left of the dough, slightly overlapping its edge. The atomic design features three elliptical orbits intersecting at a central nucleus, with small circular cutouts representing electrons along the orbits. The dough has a smooth, slightly textured surface typical of rolled-out baking dough, with visible speckles and minor imperfections. Both objects rest on a light-toned wooden surface with horizontal grain lines running across the frame, showing natural wood texture including subtle knots and color variations. The lighting is even and diffused, casting soft shadows beneath the objects.

Thinking process: First, analyze the instructions that explicitly state transformations: "replace the circular dough with a realistic atom illustration," "center atoms as cookie designs in various colors," "add arrows labeling electrons, protons, and neutrons," "use playful font," and "section illustrations neatly with dotted lines." These indicate the following are allowed to change:
- The form and material of the dough (it will be replaced by a digital atom illustration)
- The color scheme (now allows for multiple colors, not limited to beige)
- The presence and style of text and labels
- The layout and structure of the composition (to become an infographic)
- The background scene (no requirement to preserve wooden surface)

However, the instruction does **not** say to remove or alter the atomic symbol itself — rather, it instructs to “center atoms as cookie designs,” implying the atomic shape remains a core visual motif. Also, the cookie cutter must still be present because the original object is being used as a tool to create the design. While the dough changes, the atomic shape must remain consistent in form to maintain continuity with the original concept.

Allowed Changes List:
- The circular dough → replaced with a realistic atom illustration
- Color of the atomic design → now multi-colored
- Background surface → changed to fit infographic style
- Addition of labels, arrows, text, and dotted lines
- Overall composition → transformed into educational infographic layout
- Font style → changed to whimsical/playful

Step 2– Determine the elements that should remain unchanged  
Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements: The atomic symbol (three elliptical orbits intersecting at a central nucleus with electron dots) is the defining visual feature linking both the cookie cutter and the dough imprint. It is the iconic form that gives the image its thematic identity — science-themed baking. Even though the dough will be replaced, the atomic shape must remain recognizable to preserve the conceptual link between the original object and the new infographic. This shape is not arbitrary; it is a stylized representation of an atom commonly associated with scientific imagery. Its structural components (elliptical paths, central nucleus, electron positions) must be preserved in form.

Functional/logical association elements: The cookie cutter’s function is to imprint the atomic shape onto dough. In the edited version, while the dough is replaced, the cookie cutter must still be present and retain its shape to preserve the logical narrative of “cookie cutter → atomic design.” If the cutter were altered beyond recognition, the connection between the tool and the result would break.

Non-modified element deduction: After removing all allowed changes (dough replacement, color change, background, added text), the remaining unmentioned but visually present elements include:
- The exact geometric configuration of the atomic design (number and orientation of orbits, placement of electron dots)
- The physical form and outline of the white plastic cookie cutter
- The relative positioning of the cutter and the atomic imprint (side-by-side, overlapping edge)
- The clean, precise edges of the cutout design in the dough

These must be retained to ensure visual coherence between the original and the modified image, especially since the infographic aims to be a transformation, not a complete abstraction.

Preservation Targets List:  
- The atomic design's structure: three intersecting elliptical orbits with a central nucleus and three electron positions
- The white plastic cookie cutter’s shape and outline
- The relative spatial arrangement of the cutter and the atomic imprint (cutter to the left, partially overlapping)
- The clean, continuous line quality of the atomic cutout in the dough
- The central hole in the nucleus area of the atomic design

    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The atomic symbol's structure — specifically the three elliptical orbits intersecting at a central nucleus with three distinct electron positions — is the core identity feature of the image. This stylized atomic model is not generic; its specific configuration (three orbits, symmetrical layout, electron dots) defines the subject’s theme. Changing this would make the design unrecognizable as the same atomic motif, undermining the conceptual basis of the image. Therefore, this is a key element with weight 3.
    Question: Does the atomic design retain the three intersecting elliptical orbits with a central nucleus and three electron positions?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The white plastic cookie cutter is the functional object that creates the atomic imprint. Its shape is identical to the atomic design, making it essential for maintaining the logic of the scene. If the cutter’s form is altered, the relationship between tool and result breaks down. Since the instruction does not allow changing the cutter’s shape, it must remain intact. This is a key functional element, thus weighted 3.
    Question: Is the white plastic cookie cutter retaining its original atomic-shaped outline with three elliptical loops and a central nucleus?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The relative positioning of the cutter and the dough imprint — specifically, the cutter placed to the left of the dough with partial overlap — establishes spatial continuity and suggests the action of pressing the cutter into the dough. This layout is critical for visual storytelling. Although the dough may be replaced, the positional relationship must be preserved to maintain coherence. This is a key compositional element, hence weighted 2.
    Question: Is the cookie cutter positioned to the left of the atomic imprint, with a partial edge overlap?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The clean, continuous line quality of the atomic imprint in the dough — particularly the sharp, unbroken edges of the orbits and electron holes — indicates precision and reflects the cutter’s fidelity. This detail supports the realism of the cutting process. Altering this (e.g., blurry edges, broken lines) would suggest poor execution or a different method, damaging consistency. Though secondary, it is a necessary detail for authenticity, so weighted 2.
    Question: Does the atomic imprint in the dough have clean, continuous edges without breaks or distortions?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The central hole in the nucleus area of the atomic design is a distinctive feature — it represents the nucleus and distinguishes this atomic model from other star-like shapes. Its presence confirms the design's scientific intent. Removing or altering this hole would misrepresent the atomic structure. This is a minor but identifying detail, so weighted 1.
    Question: Is there a small central hole in the nucleus area of the atomic imprint?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
