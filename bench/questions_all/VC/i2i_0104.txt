Description of reference image: The subject is a ginger tabby kitten lying down with its front paws stretched forward. The kitten has striking wide-open green eyes, a pink nose, and white whiskers. Its fur has a pattern of orange stripes on a lighter orange background. The background appears to be indoors, with a soft blur suggesting an unfocused surface behind the kitten.

### Step 1: Allowed Changes List
Thinking process: The editing instructions specify the addition of text ("Warm Home" and "Adopt Love"), implying textual content may overlay the image. However, there is no mention of altering the kitten’s appearance, background setting, or other visual specifics. Hence, these can be considered off-limits unless necessary to accommodate the text.

Allowed Changes List:
- Add text: "Warm Home" and "Adopt Love"

### Step 2: Preservation Targets List
Thinking process: Core recognition elements include the kitten's distinct tabby fur pattern, eye color, facial structure, and overall posture. Functional/logical association elements would involve keeping the natural position of the kitten relative to its intended portrayal as an adoptable pet. Remaining elements like background blurring should also be kept for visual coherence.

Preservation Targets List:
- Kitten’s tabby fur pattern (orange stripes and lighter orange base)
- Green eye color and open eye expression
- Pink nose and white whiskers
- Kitten's relaxed lying posture with extended paws
