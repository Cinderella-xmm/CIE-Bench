**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a young Black girl standing in a golden wheat field under a bright blue sky with scattered white clouds. She is wearing a vibrant, multicolored traditional African dress featuring bold geometric patterns in red, yellow, green, pink, and blue. The dress has a wide, layered beaded collar made of multicolored beads arranged in concentric rows around the neck. Her hair is styled in braids adorned with colorful beads. She wears multiple bracelets on her right wrist and smiles joyfully, looking upward with her arms outstretched, holding the hem of her flowing skirt. The posture conveys movement and freedom. The wheat stalks are tall and golden, swaying gently, and occupy the foreground, partially obscuring her lower legs. The lighting is natural daylight, warm and bright, emphasizing the vivid colors of her attire.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instructions explicitly transform the image into a Renaissance-style painting with an angelic figure. Key changes include:  
- Reimagining the **colorful dress** as **flowing celestial robes**, implying that the form and function of the clothing can change.  
- Adding **gold and silver filigree** to the dress, indicating decorative enhancement but not necessarily preservation of original pattern or color.  
- Transforming the **wheat field** into **heavenly clouds**, meaning the ground-level environment is fully replaceable.  
- Changing the **sky** into a **starry night backdrop with dawn hues**, indicating full replacement of background atmosphere.  
- Introducing **subtle halos** and **glowing wisps** held in each hand, which are new elements not present originally.  
- Altering the **posture** to reflect "serene grace", suggesting the pose may be modified but not necessarily its core dynamic (e.g., arms extended).  

Thus, the following elements are allowed to change:
- Dress style, material, and design (replaced by celestial robes with filigree)
- Background environment (wheat field → clouds)
- Sky (daytime blue → starry night with dawn hues)
- Accessories (beads, bracelets) — likely replaced by angelic attributes
- Posture — adjusted for serenity and grace
- Facial expression — may shift from joyful laughter to peaceful serenity

**Allowed Changes List:**  
- The form and design of the dress (including colors, patterns, and structure)  
- The wheat field (entirely transformed into clouds)  
- The sky (changed from daytime blue to starry night with dawn hues)  
- The accessories (beads, bracelets)  
- The facial expression and emotional tone  
- The overall posture (adjusted for serene grace)  
- The presence of glowing wisps and halos (new additions)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
Despite the extensive transformation, certain visual elements must remain unchanged because they are either core identity features of the original subject or critical for maintaining logical coherence if not explicitly altered.

- **Core recognition elements**: The subject is a young Black girl. While her appearance is being reimagined as an angel, the **racial identity and gender** must remain consistent to preserve the original subject’s essence. Specifically, the **skin tone** and **facial features** should retain their original characteristics unless explicitly transformed. However, since the instruction calls for an “angelic figure,” this implies a symbolic transformation rather than literal preservation. But since no explicit mention is made of changing race or ethnicity, the **identity of the subject as a Black child** remains central. Therefore, **her skin tone** and **basic facial structure** (e.g., shape of eyes, nose, mouth) should be retained even if stylized.

- **Functional/logical association elements**: The **act of holding the skirt edges** with both hands is a key action in the original image. This gesture contributes to the sense of motion and joy. Although the instruction says she will hold “ethereal, glowing wisps,” this does not negate the **hand position**—it only replaces the object. Thus, the **posture of outstretched arms** and **hands positioned outward** should be preserved in form, even if the objects held change.

- **Non-modified element deduction**: The **braided hairstyle** is a distinctive cultural feature and part of the subject’s identity. Though the instruction doesn’t specify retaining it, it is not mentioned as something to be changed. Since the transformation is toward an angelic figure, the braids could be stylized or replaced. However, given that the original image's cultural authenticity is significant, and the instruction does not say to remove them, we infer that **the presence of braids** (even if reimagined) should be preserved in some form—either as part of the halo or as flowing locks.

Additionally, the **position of the head tilted upward** and **eyes closed in laughter** is a defining emotional and spatial cue. Even if transformed into serenity, the **upward gaze** should remain, as it reflects the core moment of uplifted joy.

Finally, the **overall silhouette** of the figure—especially the **outstretched arms and lifted skirt**—is crucial for continuity. This dynamic pose is central to the image’s energy and must be preserved in form, even if details change.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
- Skin tone of the subject (dark brown complexion)  
- Facial features including eye shape, nose, and mouth structure  
- Outstretched arm posture with hands open and facing outward  
- Upward tilt of the head and gaze directed toward the sky  
- Presence of braided hair (in any form, even stylized)  
- Position of the body mid-motion, with skirt flaring outward

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Retained Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The dark brown skin tone is a core identity feature of the subject, distinguishing her racial and cultural identity. In the context of transforming her into an angelic figure, preserving the skin tone ensures that the original subject's identity remains intact despite stylistic changes. If the skin were lightened or altered significantly, the transformation would lose its grounding in the original image. This is a 3-point element because it is essential for recognition.
    Question: Is the subject's skin tone still dark brown?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The upward tilt of the head and upward gaze are critical to conveying the emotion of joy and openness to the sky. This specific orientation is central to the composition and emotional tone of the original image. Even in a Renaissance angelic depiction, the direction of the gaze must remain upward to maintain continuity with the original moment of wonder. Losing this would disrupt the narrative logic of the scene.
    Question: Is the subject’s head tilted upward with her gaze directed toward the sky?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The outstretched arms with hands open and facing outward are functional elements that support the dynamic motion of the skirt and express joy. These are not just aesthetic but structural to the image’s balance and narrative. The instruction allows for holding glowing wisps, but the hand position must remain consistent to preserve the original gesture. This is a 2-point element because it is important for posture and action continuity.
    Question: Are both arms extended outward with hands open and palms facing forward?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The presence of braided hair is a distinctive cultural marker and a key detail in the original image. While the instruction allows for transformation into an angelic figure, the absence of braids would erase a significant part of the subject’s identity. Even if stylized, the braid structure should be retained in some form (e.g., flowing strands or halo-like braids). This is a 2-point element because it is culturally significant and visually identifiable.
    Question: Does the subject have braided hair, even if stylized?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The flare of the skirt created by the wind and the subject’s movement is a key visual element that defines the image’s dynamism. Even though the dress is transformed into celestial robes, the motion of the fabric flaring outward must be preserved to maintain the sense of freedom and joy. This is a 1-point element because it is a secondary detail but contributes to visual coherence.
    Question: Is the lower portion of the garment flaring outward, suggesting motion?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The facial expression, particularly the smile and visible teeth, is a core emotional identifier. The instruction mentions shifting to "serene grace," but this does not imply erasure of the joyful expression. A gentle smile or serene look can still preserve the original warmth. However, if the mouth is closed or distorted, the emotional continuity is broken. This is a 2-point element because it affects the emotional identity of the subject.
    Question: Is the subject smiling with visible teeth?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
