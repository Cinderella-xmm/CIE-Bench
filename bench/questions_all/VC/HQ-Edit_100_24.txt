**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a young woman with long, straight black hair parted in the center, wearing a sleeveless red qipao (cheongsam) adorned with intricate golden embroidery. The embroidery features floral patterns and a prominent stylized dragon motif on the left side of the chest, rendered in raised silk threadwork with detailed scales and flowing mane. The collar is high and mandarin-style, trimmed in gold and red, with decorative button loops. Her posture is poised, with hands gently clasped in front of her waist. The background is a neutral, softly lit gray tone, devoid of any distinct environmental elements, emphasizing the subject’s attire and facial features. Her skin is smooth, makeup is natural yet refined, with defined eyebrows, soft pink lips, and subtle eye shadow. The lighting is soft and directional, highlighting the texture of the fabric and contours of her face.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction explicitly states:  
- "Transform the image into a Qing Dynasty traditional portrait" → indicates a complete stylistic and contextual transformation.  
- "Subject in an elaborately embroidered silk robe with dragon patterns" → changes clothing style and design, but **dragon patterns are already present**, so their presence may be retained or enhanced.  
- "Reimagined with opulent jade jewelry" → implies **addition of new accessories**, not retention of existing ones.  
- "Extend the hairstyle into an ornate headpiece with intricate jade hairpins" → **hairstyle is to be changed**, including length, structure, and addition of adornments.  
- "Set the background as an elegant study with classic Chinese scrolls" → **background must be replaced entirely**.  
- Color palette: "rich reds, golds, and deep greens" → color scheme can be adjusted, but **original red and gold tones in the dress may be preserved or intensified**.

From this analysis:
- **Clothing type**: Can change from modern qipao to Qing-style robe — allowed.
- **Dragon pattern**: Already present; instruction says "with dragon patterns" — likely to be retained or expanded, but not removed.
- **Jewelry**: Not present originally; will be added — allowed.
- **Hairstyle**: To be transformed into an elaborate headpiece — allowed.
- **Background**: Entirely replaced — allowed.
- **Facial features and pose**: Not mentioned for change — **implied to remain** unless contradicted by context.

Thus, only **elements not mentioned for change** should be considered for preservation.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
- Hairstyle (length, structure, addition of headpiece and jade hairpins)  
- Jewelry (addition of opulent jade pieces)  
- Clothing form (from modern qipao to Qing Dynasty robe)  
- Background (replaced with study and scrolls)  
- Color balance (adjusted toward rich reds, golds, deep greens)  
- Lighting and atmosphere (to match traditional portrait style)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
Core recognition elements:  
- The **dragon embroidery** is a key visual feature in the original image. It is not just decorative but central to the cultural symbolism and aesthetic identity of the garment. Even if the robe is reimagined, the **presence and position of the dragon motif** should be retained, as it is a defining element of the subject's attire and cultural significance.  
- The **floral embroidery patterns** (especially peonies and vines) are part of the textile design and contribute to the richness of the garment. While the overall robe may change, these **specific motifs** should be preserved in form and placement if they are part of the original design intent.  
- The **subject’s facial features** — such as the shape of the eyes, nose, lips, and overall facial symmetry — are core to identity. Unless specified otherwise, **facial structure must remain unchanged**.  
- The **pose and hand positioning** (hands clasped in front of the waist) is a deliberate compositional choice that contributes to elegance and balance. This **posture** should be preserved for continuity in expression and framing.  
- The **texture and sheen of the red silk fabric** — particularly its lustrous quality and visible weave — is a material detail that defines the garment’s realism. Though color may shift, **fabric texture** should remain consistent unless overridden by the new style.

Functional/logical association elements:  
- The **relationship between the subject and the garment** — i.e., the way the body fits within the tailored cut of the qipao — must remain logically consistent. If the robe is changed, the fit should still follow anatomical accuracy and proportional harmony.  
- The **placement of the dragon** on the left chest is a specific spatial detail. Moving it would disrupt visual balance and symbolic meaning (e.g., dragons often appear on the left in traditional Chinese art). Thus, **positioning** should be preserved.

Non-modified element deduction:  
After excluding all allowed changes (hairstyle, jewelry, background, clothing form), what remains?  
- **Face**: Not mentioned for change → must be preserved.  
- **Hands and arms**: Pose is implied to be kept → must be preserved.  
- **Garment details not mentioned for replacement**: Specifically, the **embroidery patterns (dragon and flowers)**, **color of the fabric (red)**, and **texture of the silk** are not said to be altered — thus, they must be retained.  
- **Lighting direction and softness** — while atmosphere may change, the **directional highlight on the cheek and shoulder** is a compositional cue that should be maintained for consistency in modeling.

Therefore, **the core identity of the subject lies in her facial features, posture, and the specific embroidery details of the garment**.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
- Facial features (eyes, nose, lips, jawline)  
- Hand position (clasped in front of waist)  
- Dragon embroidery (presence, position on left chest, scale texture)  
- Floral embroidery (peonies and vines, location along right side)  
- Red silk fabric texture and sheen  
- Overall silhouette and body proportions

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The dragon motif is a culturally significant and visually dominant feature of the original garment. Its presence on the left chest, with detailed scales and flowing mane, is a core identifier of the traditional Chinese aesthetic. Removing or relocating it would fundamentally alter the identity of the garment and the cultural symbolism intended. Therefore, its existence and placement are critical for recognition and consistency.
    Question: Is the dragon embroidery clearly visible on the left side of the chest, with detailed scales and a raised texture?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The floral embroidery, especially the peony blossoms and vine patterns, forms a secondary but essential part of the textile design. These motifs are not generic but specifically placed along the right side of the dress. Their retention ensures continuity in the artistic composition and prevents the garment from appearing arbitrarily redesigned. They are key to maintaining the original aesthetic balance.
    Question: Are the peony and vine floral patterns visible along the right side of the dress, matching the original arrangement?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The subject’s facial features — particularly the shape of the eyes, the fullness of the lips, and the symmetry of the face — are unique identifiers of her identity. Any alteration to these features would result in a different person being depicted, undermining the integrity of the portrait. Since no modification is requested to the face, it must remain unchanged.
    Question: Does the subject retain her original facial features, including the shape of the eyes, nose, and lips?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The hand position — clasped gently in front of the waist — is a deliberate compositional choice that conveys grace and restraint. Changing this would affect the emotional tone and balance of the portrait. As no instruction mentions altering the pose, the hand placement must be preserved for visual coherence.
    Question: Are the hands positioned together in front of the waist, fingers interlaced?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The red silk fabric has a distinct luster and weave texture that reflects light in a specific way, contributing to the realism and luxury of the garment. While the color palette may be enhanced, the underlying fabric texture must remain consistent to preserve the material authenticity. Losing this texture would make the garment appear synthetic or poorly rendered.
    Question: Is the red silk fabric visibly textured with a reflective sheen, showing fine weave details?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The silhouette of the subject — including the curve of the spine, shoulder line, and arm contour — defines her physical form. Altering this would distort the anatomy and compromise the realism of the figure. Since no instruction specifies changing the body shape, the original proportions must be maintained.
    Question: Does the subject maintain the original body proportions, with a natural curvature of the spine and balanced shoulders?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
