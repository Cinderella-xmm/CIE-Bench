Description of reference image: The subject consists of two identical brown armchairs positioned symmetrically on either side of a large framed painting of a sunset over water with palm trees. The armchairs are upholstered in a smooth fabric and rest on light wooden legs. The floor is a polished wood surface, and the wall is plain white, emphasizing the chairs and the painting. The painting displays a vibrant sunset with a gradient from warm orange-yellow to cooler blue tones, and silhouettes of palm trees along the shoreline.

Thinking process:  
The editing instructions specify replacing the physical painting with a digital screen displaying real-time weather imagery. Thus, this specific element—the physical painting—is allowed for change. However, other aspects including the two armchairs, their positions relative to the wall, the room setup (the clean white wall and polished wooden floor), and the overall scene layout should remain unchanged unless specified otherwise.

Allowed Changes List:
Specific element 1 that allows for changes - The physical painting on the wall.
(Specific element 2 that allows for changes - The content displayed on the digital screen.)

Step 2 - Determine the elements that should remain unchanged:

Thinking process:
Core recognition elements: The two identical armchairs are key identifiers of the scene. Their design, color, material, and placement are essential for maintaining the scene’s identity. Similarly, the clean white wall and polished wooden flooring underpin the setting and must be retained.
Functional/logical association elements: The symmetrical arrangement of the armchairs around the central focal point (originally the painting) should remain because this creates balance and guides the viewer’s attention logically. The digital screen would logically replace the painting while keeping the same central positioning.
Non-modified element deduction: The room’s lighting, shadows cast by the armchairs, and the polished wood grain should be preserved to maintain visual coherence.

Preservation Targets List:  
(Element 1 that should be maintained - Two identical brown armchairs with smooth upholstery and light wooden legs.)  
(Element 2 that should be maintained - Symmetrical positioning of the armchairs relative to the wall.)  
(Element 3 that should be maintained - Clean white wall and polished wooden flooring.)  
(Element 4 that should be maintained - Room lighting and shadows created by the armchairs.)
