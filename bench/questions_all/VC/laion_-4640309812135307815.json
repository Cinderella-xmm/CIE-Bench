      "thinking_process": "The red clutch held in the woman’s right hand is a key accessory that matches the dress and completes the ensemble.

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The overall silhouette of the dress—its flowing train, asymmetrical petal arrangement, and sheer quality—is the foundational design that inspires the fragrance bottle. Even though it is being transformed, the shape and flow must be preserved in the bottle’s form to maintain conceptual fidelity. Losing this silhouette would disconnect the new object from the original.",
      "question": "Does the fragrance bottle retain the elongated, flowing silhouette of the original dress?",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The red color of the petals and the dress is a central visual theme. The instruction specifies a “translucent red-tinted glass” and “red flower cap,” so the color must be preserved in the transformed object. The red hue is essential to maintaining the identity of the design concept.",
      "question": "Is the fragrance bottle still predominantly red in color?",
