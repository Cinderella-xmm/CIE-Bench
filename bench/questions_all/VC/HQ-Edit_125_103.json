      "thinking_process": "The large pink peony is the most dominant and identifiable floral feature in the original image. Its shape—layered petals with a defined center—and its position on the teapot’s body are critical to the visual identity of the tea set. If this flower is omitted, replaced, or significantly altered in form, the essence of the original design is lost. This makes it a core recognition element with a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Is there a large pink peony flower prominently displayed on the body of the teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The white clustered flower, resembling a chrysanthemum or hydrangea, is positioned to the left of the peony and forms a key part of the balanced floral composition. Its presence contributes to the symmetry and richness of the design. Removing or replacing it would disrupt the intended aesthetic and reduce recognizability. Thus, it is an important element with a weight of 2 points.",
      "question": "Is there a white clustered flower located next to the pink peony on the teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The green leaves and stems surrounding the flowers provide structural framing and enhance the botanical realism of the design. These are not merely decorative—they anchor the floral elements within a natural context. Their absence would make the design appear incomplete or artificial. They are essential for visual coherence and thus warrant a weight of 2 points.",
      "question": "Are there green leaves and stems extending from the base of the flowers on the teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The color scheme—soft pink, white, green, and orange-red berries—is integral to the cultural and aesthetic identity of the tea set. Even if rendered in gold foil, the underlying colors must be preserved to maintain consistency with the original. Altering this palette would fundamentally change the visual character of the design. This is a key detail with a weight of 2 points.",
      "question": "Do the floral elements include pink, white, green, and orange-red berry-like accents?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The presence of tea in each of the four cups is a functional and visual necessity. It confirms the object’s purpose and maintains narrative continuity. Even if the cups are redesigned with lids, the tea must still be visible or implied. Losing this would break the logic of the scene. This is a core functional element with a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Is amber-colored tea visible in all four cups?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The spatial arrangement of the floral elements—centered on the teapot, with the peony and white flower forming a balanced cluster—is crucial for visual harmony. Any significant shift in positioning (e.g., moving the peony to the side) would distort the original composition. This layout is a secondary but meaningful design feature, so it is assigned a weight of 1 point.",
      "question": "Are the floral elements centrally located on the body of the teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The textured surface of the teapot—resembling a fine mesh or woven fabric—is a distinctive tactile and visual feature that sets it apart from smooth ceramics. While the material may change, the visual impression of texture must be preserved to retain authenticity. This is a detail-level element but important for fidelity, hence a weight of 1 point.",
      "question": "Does the teapot surface exhibit a fine mesh or woven-texture appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "thinking_process": "The presence of four distinct cups—of varying sizes and shapes—establishes the tea set as a complete service. Even if redesigned as stackable units, the number and conceptual grouping must remain. Reducing or increasing the count would alter the functional narrative. This is a minor but necessary detail with a weight of 1 point.",
      "question": "Are there exactly four cups present in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
