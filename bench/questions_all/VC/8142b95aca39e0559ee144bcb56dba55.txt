**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a full-length depiction of an ancient Chinese philosopher, likely Confucius, standing upright in a formal pose. He has a long, thick black beard with gray streaks, a balding head with dark hair tied back in a traditional topknot, and a solemn facial expression with prominent eyebrows and a straight nose. He wears a layered robe: the outer garment is brown with wide sleeves, adorned with intricate blue spiral patterns along the edges and cuffs. Beneath it, a lighter inner robe appears in pale yellow or cream, featuring symmetrical curved motifs resembling stylized flames or clouds. The lower garment is light purple-blue with geometric and wave-like designs, including vertical stripes and ornamental borders. His hands are clasped together near his chest in a respectful gesture. A dark staff rests against his right side. The overall color palette includes earthy browns, vibrant blues, creamy yellows, and soft purples. The background is plain white, emphasizing the figure without distraction.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction explicitly states: *"Transform the classic figure into a chibi-style Russian nesting doll set of six."* This means:
- The **form** of the original figure is to be changed from a full-sized human representation to **six progressively smaller chibi-style dolls**, each nested within the other.
- The **style** changes from realistic/illustrative to **chibi (cute, simplified cartoon)**.
- The **number of figures** increases from one to six.
- The **proportion** and **scale** of the subject change drastically due to nesting.
- The **scene** is specified as *"an elegant, dark-wood desk"*, so the background/environment is replaced entirely.
- The **motion effect** ("gentle breeze swaying robes") introduces dynamic movement not present originally.

However, the instruction also specifies:
- Each doll must display the **original ornate attire with vibrant orange and blue hues** → implies that **color scheme and design motifs** from the original clothing should be preserved.
- The **core identity** of the figure (Confucius-like philosopher) is implied by “classic figure” and the description of attire, suggesting the **iconic features** such as beard, hairstyle, and clothing patterns must remain recognizable even in chibi form.

Thus, the **allowed changes** include:
- Transformation of the figure into a **set of six chibi-style Russian nesting dolls**.
- Change in **scale, proportion, and artistic style** (from illustrative to chibi).
- Replacement of **background** with a dark-wood desk.
- Addition of **motion effect** (swaying robes).
- Use of **vibrant orange and blue hues** instead of original colors (though this may conflict with retention — see below).

But the **instruction does not allow modification of**:
- The **identity of the figure** (implied by "classic figure").
- The **core visual elements of the attire** (e.g., patterns, structure), since they are said to be "adorned in the original ornate attire".
- The **essential features** that define the character’s appearance (beard, topknot, robe layers), because otherwise the transformation would lose its reference.

Therefore, while the **form** and **context** change, **key identifying visual traits** must still be recognizable.

---

**Allowed Changes List:**
- Subject form: transformed into six chibi-style Russian nesting dolls
- Artistic style: changed from traditional illustration to chibi/cartoon
- Number of figures: increased from one to six
- Scale and size: progressively smaller for nesting
- Background: replaced with a dark-wood desk
- Motion: addition of gentle breeze effect causing robes to sway
- Color palette: shifted to vibrant orange and blue hues (as per instruction)
- Pose: may be simplified or adjusted for chibi proportions

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
We now determine which **visual elements from the original image** must be preserved despite the transformation.

**Core recognition elements:**
- The **long beard** is a defining trait of Confucius in traditional depictions; removing or altering it would make the figure unrecognizable.
- The **topknot hairstyle** is iconic in classical Chinese scholar imagery and essential for identification.
- The **layered robes with specific decorative patterns** (blue spiral borders, flame-like motifs on inner robe, geometric lower garment) are unique to the original design and distinguish it from generic robes.
- The **hand position (clasped near chest)** is a signature gesture associated with respect and philosophy, reinforcing identity.
- The **staff** is a key accessory indicating wisdom or authority; its presence helps identify the figure.

These are **core identity features** — if lost, the figure becomes unrecognizable as the original subject.

**Functional/logical association elements:**
- The **clothing structure** (outer brown robe over inner yellow, then purple-blue lower garment) maintains functional layering typical of historical scholar attire. While the style may simplify, the **layering logic** should remain to preserve authenticity.
- The **relative positioning of garments** (e.g., blue trim on sleeves, pattern placement) supports continuity between original and edited versions.

**Non-modified element deduction:**
Even though the **color palette** is instructed to shift to "vibrant orange and blue," the **design motifs** (spirals, flame shapes, geometric bands) must still be retained in some form, as they are described as part of the "original ornate attire." Thus, **pattern types** are preserved, but **colors** may be altered.

Also, the **overall silhouette** of the figure (broad shoulders, long beard, flowing robes) should be preserved in chibi form — even if exaggerated, the **proportional relationship** (e.g., large head, small body) should reflect the original's dignified posture.

Hence, **patterns, beard, topknot, hand gesture, staff, and garment layers** must be retained.

---

**Preservation Targets List:**
- Presence of long beard with gray streaks
- Topknot hairstyle with dark hair tied back
- Layered robe structure: outer brown robe with blue spiral trim, inner cream/yellow robe with flame-like motifs, lower purple-blue garment with geometric patterns
- Clasped hands near chest
- Staff held at side
- Specific decorative patterns (spiral borders, flame motifs, wave lines)
- Proportional arrangement of garments (layering order)

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

Q1:  
Thinking process: The long beard with gray streaks is a core identity feature of Confucius in traditional art. Its absence or replacement with a short or solid-colored beard would destroy recognition. Even in chibi form, the beard must be visibly long and show variation in tone. Therefore, this is a key element with weight 3.  
Question: Is the long beard with visible gray streaks present on the figure?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The topknot hairstyle is a distinctive marker of scholarly status in ancient China and directly identifies the figure as a sage. In chibi form, it must still be a tied-back bun at the top of the head. Losing this would misrepresent the character. Thus, it is a core identity element.  
Question: Is there a dark hair knot tied at the top of the head?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The outer robe has distinct blue spiral patterns along the edges and cuffs. These are not generic decorations but specific ornamental motifs that define the attire. Their presence ensures fidelity to the original design. Even if colors shift, the pattern type must remain.  
Question: Are blue spiral patterns present along the edges of the outer robe?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The inner robe features symmetrical flame-like or cloud-shaped motifs in cream or pale yellow. These are unique to the original design and help distinguish it from other robes. Their retention is essential for maintaining visual coherence with the source.  
Question: Are flame-like or cloud-shaped motifs visible on the inner robe?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The hands are clasped together near the chest, a gesture symbolic of reverence and teaching. In chibi form, this gesture must still be clearly depicted to maintain the character’s demeanor. Altering it would affect the figure’s identity.  
Question: Are the hands positioned together near the chest in a clasped gesture?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The staff is a key accessory indicating wisdom and authority. It appears in the original image leaning against the figure’s side. Even in chibi form, its presence is necessary for full identification. Removing it would diminish authenticity.  
Question: Is a dark staff visible next to the figure’s right side?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The lower garment has geometric and wave-like patterns, including vertical stripes and ornamental borders. These details contribute to the richness of the attire and must be preserved to retain the original design’s complexity.  
Question: Are geometric or wave-like patterns present on the lower part of the robe?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q8:  
Thinking process: The layered structure of the robes (outer over inner over lower) is functionally significant and visually distinctive. Even in chibi form, the sequence of garments must be preserved to reflect the original composition.  
Question: Are three distinct layers of clothing visible: outer brown, inner cream, and lower purple-blue?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q9:  
Thinking process: The overall color scheme in the original includes brown, blue, cream, and purple-blue. Although the instruction allows "vibrant orange and blue hues," the **design motifs** (not just colors) must remain. However, the **presence of blue** in key areas (like trim) is required for consistency. But since color can be modified, this is a secondary detail. Still, the **blue trim** is a recurring feature and should be maintained in some form.  
Question: Is blue used as a primary accent color on the robe edges and trim?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q10:  
Thinking process: The figure stands upright with a dignified posture. While chibi form may exaggerate proportions, the **upright stance** must be preserved to maintain the character’s authoritative presence.  
Question: Is the figure depicted standing upright with a straight back?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1
