      "thinking_process": "The golden halo around Mary is a core iconographic feature distinguishing her as a holy figure in Christian art. It is a universally recognized symbol of divinity and must remain present regardless of artistic style. In the original image, it is a simple circular gold ring above her head. Even in a Renaissance fresco, this halo must be preserved in form and position to maintain identification. Losing it would make her indistinguishable from other figures.",
      "question": "Is there a golden circular halo positioned directly above Mary's head?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "Joseph’s staff with a white lily at the top is a defining attribute tied to his role as a righteous and pure guardian. This specific object is not just decorative but symbolic. In the original image, it extends upward from his hand. Any transformation must retain this object in his grasp, even if rendered in fresco style. Removing or altering it would misrepresent his identity.",
      "question": "Does Joseph hold a staff with a white lily flower at its tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The infant Jesus is depicted with a radiant golden halo composed of fan-shaped rays behind his head, symbolizing divine light. This is a unique visual marker distinguishing him from ordinary infants. Even when transformed into a fresco, this halo must remain visible and structured similarly to ensure recognition. Its absence would undermine the theological significance of the scene.",
      "question": "Is there a golden radiating halo (fan-shaped rays) behind the infant Jesus' head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Mary’s kneeling posture is central to the narrative of reverence and humility. She is on one knee, hands clasped, facing the infant. This pose is iconic in nativity representations. Changing it would alter the emotional tone and deviate from traditional depictions. Thus, her body orientation and gesture must be preserved.",
      "question": "Is Mary depicted in a kneeling position with her hands clasped in front of her?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The infant Jesus lies on his back with arms crossed over his chest and legs bent, a common pose in religious statuary to suggest innocence and peace. This posture is distinct and must be retained to maintain authenticity. Altering it could lead to misidentification or loss of symbolic meaning.",
      "question": "Is the infant Jesus lying on his back with arms crossed over his chest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The relative spatial arrangement—Mary on the left, Joseph on the right, infant centered between them—is a fundamental compositional rule in nativity scenes. This triangular balance supports narrative clarity. Even in a fresco, the layout must remain unchanged to preserve the scene’s coherence and viewer understanding.",
      "question": "Are the figures arranged such that Mary is on the left, Joseph on the right, and the infant Jesus is centrally located between them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The rocky bases under Mary and Joseph provide physical grounding and contextual realism. Though they may be stylized in a fresco, their presence as supporting structures must be retained. Their location and function as platforms for the figures are important for maintaining spatial logic and stability in the scene.",
      "question": "Do Mary and Joseph stand on separate rocky bases beneath their feet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "thinking_process": "The white fluffy surface beneath the infant serves as a visual contrast and symbolizes purity or manger bedding. While it may be reinterpreted in a fresco (e.g., painted wool or clouds), its function as a soft, white layer under the infant must remain. Its presence ensures continuity with the original depiction.",
      "question": "Is there a white, fluffy surface beneath the infant Jesus?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
