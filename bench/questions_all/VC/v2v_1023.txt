### Step 1 - Description of Reference Image and Allowed Changes List:

**Description of Reference Image:**  
The image shows four individuals sitting closely together on a couch, holding video game controllers. They are dressed casually, with two wearing sweaters, one in a denim jacket over a white top, and another in a green shirt. Their expressions vary from surprise to joy. The background is minimalistic, featuring a white wall with some plants on a shelf.

**Thinking Process:**  
The instructions specify transforming the group into chibi-style 3D characters inside a snow globe. This means the physical appearance of the people can be stylized, but their core identities and actions should remain recognizable. The scene outside the snow globe is described in detail, indicating that the background can be entirely replaced. However, the snow globe setting implies that the group's interaction and positioning should be retained.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
1. Transform the individuals into chibi-style 3D characters.  
2. Replace the background with a snow globe setting on a table in a warm living room.  
3. Add seasonal decorations like miniature snowflakes and fairy lights inside the snow globe.  
4. Adjust lighting to create an amber-toned, cozy ambiance.  

### Step 2 - Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged:

**Thinking Process:**  
Core recognition elements include the group's interaction (holding controllers and sitting together), their relative positions, and their individual identities (facial features and clothing styles). Functional elements like the controllers and their grip should also be preserved. Remaining elements like the couch and their casual attire contribute to visual coherence.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
1. The group's interaction and relative positions.  
2. Individual identities (facial features and clothing styles).  
3. The presence and grip of the game controllers.  
4. The casual nature of their attire.
