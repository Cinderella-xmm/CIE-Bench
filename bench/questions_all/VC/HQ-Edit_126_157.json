      "thinking_process": "The long white beard and mustache are the most distinctive facial features of the elderly man, serving as a core identifier of his character and age. Their absence or alteration would fundamentally change the subject's identity, making him unrecognizable from the original image. This is a key identity feature, hence weighted at 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the elderly man’s long white beard and mustache clearly visible and present?",

      "thinking_process": "The conical straw hat is a culturally iconic and visually defining accessory in the image. It is directly tied to the subject’s identity and setting. Removing or replacing it would break the cultural and visual continuity of the scene. Its presence is critical for recognition.",
      "question": "Is the wide-brimmed conical straw hat positioned on the man’s head?",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The man’s cross-legged seated posture is essential to the composition and narrative of the scene. It defines his interaction with the boat and the oar. Changing this posture would alter the functional logic of the scene and disrupt the visual balance.",
      "question": "Is the man seated cross-legged in the center of the boat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The oar is a functional object integral to the boat’s operation and the man’s role as a rower. Its horizontal position across the lap is a specific detail that supports the scene’s realism. Altering its position or removing it would break the logical consistency of the action.",
      "question": "Is the oar held horizontally across the man’s lap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The wooden boat’s structure, particularly the visible planks and central support bar, is a key environmental detail that anchors the scene. Even if textured differently in the diorama, its form and layout must remain consistent to preserve the original object’s identity.",
      "question": "Are the wooden planks of the boat clearly visible and arranged in a linear fashion along the hull?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The calm water surface beneath the boat is a critical environmental element that establishes the setting. Its presence is necessary for the scene’s logic—without water, the boat would not float. Even if stylized, it must remain under the boat.",
      "question": "Is the boat floating on a calm water surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "thinking_process": "The distant mountain range forms the backdrop and defines the landscape. While its color may be changed to pastel blue, its silhouette and presence as a horizon line are essential for maintaining the original scene’s spatial context.",
      "question": "Are there misty mountains visible in the background behind the water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The dark brown robe with visible folds and sleeves is a key part of the man’s attire and contributes to his identity. While texture may be adjusted, the color and general shape must remain to maintain visual consistency.",
      "question": "Is the man wearing a dark brown, loose-fitting robe with visible sleeve folds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
