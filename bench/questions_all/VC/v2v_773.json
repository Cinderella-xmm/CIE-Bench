      "thinking_process": "The original apple has a distinct central seed located within a cavity at the core of the fruit. This seed is a key anatomical feature that defines the apple’s internal structure. Although the instruction allows transformation into a figurine, if the edit is to maintain a symbolic link to the original, the presence of a central element resembling a seed could be considered a core identifier. However, since the instruction does not require retention of any biological feature, and the figurine is to be inspired by the apple rather than derived from it, the seed itself is not a mandatory element. Nevertheless, for consistency, if the figurine includes a central motif (e.g., a heart-shaped emblem), it may be interpreted as a nod to the seed. But this is not guaranteed. Therefore, the question focuses on whether the seed is present in the original image, which it is, but its presence in the edited version is not required. Hence, this question tests whether the editor acknowledges the original feature, even if it is not preserved.",
      "question": "Is there a single dark brown seed visible in the center of the apple's cross-section?",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The apple’s flesh exhibits a network of fine lines and wrinkles, forming a web-like texture that is characteristic of dried fruit. This texture is a defining visual trait of the apple in its current state. While the instruction allows for artistic reinterpretation, if the figurine is to be “inspired” by the apple, one might expect some textural influence. However, since the instruction does not mandate preservation of texture, and the figurine will have sculpted surfaces, this detail is not required. Still, the question checks whether the original texture is recognized as a key feature.",
      "question": "Does the apple’s flesh show a dry, fibrous texture with visible vein-like patterns?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The stem is a prominent feature of the apple, extending upward from the top. It is dark brown and slightly curved, with a rough texture. In the edited version, this could be reinterpreted as a hat or staff, but its presence as a vertical protrusion from the top of the apple is a key positional cue. Since the instruction does not require its preservation, but it is a distinctive part of the original, the question assesses whether this feature was noted.",
      "question": "Is there a dark brown stem attached to the top of the apple?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The apple is cut in half vertically, revealing a symmetrical cross-section. This symmetry is a key compositional feature of the image. While the figurine may not be symmetrical, the original image’s symmetry is a notable visual trait. The instruction does not require symmetry in the figurine, so this is not a preservation target, but it is a distinguishing feature of the original.",
      "question": "Is the apple sliced vertically, exposing a symmetrical cross-section?",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The apple rests on a neutral, light gray surface with a matte finish. This background is minimal and uniform, serving to highlight the apple without distraction. The instruction specifies a new scene with a collector’s box and accessories, so the background is not preserved. However, the original surface is a key environmental element that defines the context of the image. Its absence in the edited version is expected, but the question confirms its presence in the original.",
      "question": "Is the apple placed on a flat, light gray, matte surface?",
