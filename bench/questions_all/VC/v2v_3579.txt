Description of reference image: The subject is a large white rectangular plate placed on a dark, marbled surface. On the plate, sushi pieces are meticulously arranged to form the geographical outline of the United States of America, including the contiguous states, Alaska, and Hawaii. The sushi includes various types: salmon nigiri (orange-pink slices), maki rolls with green cucumber or yellow-orange fillings, black seaweed-wrapped pieces, and some with visible rice layers. The arrangement follows the shape of U.S. states, with each state represented by one or more sushi pieces. Alaska is positioned in the upper left corner of the plate, and Hawaii is depicted as a small cluster of sushi pieces near the bottom left. A clear glass of water is placed in the top-left corner of the frame, slightly off-center from the plate. The background is a dark, polished stone surface with subtle gray veining, providing contrast to the bright colors of the sushi and the white plate.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions: "Position the sushi pieces to create the figure of a person with their right arm lifted." This instruction explicitly changes the **arrangement** of the sushi pieces to form a human figure, specifically one with a raised right arm. Therefore, the **form and layout** of the sushi are allowed to change. However, the instruction does not mention changing the **type**, **color**, **texture**, or **material** of the sushi itself—only their **spatial configuration**. Thus, the **individual sushi components** (e.g., salmon nigiri, maki rolls, seaweed wraps) must remain visually consistent in appearance. Additionally, the **scene elements** such as the white plate, the dark marble background, and the glass of water are not mentioned for modification, so they should be retained unless implied otherwise. Since the instruction only specifies repositioning the sushi, the **original sushi types and their visual characteristics** must be preserved, even if rearranged.

Allowed Changes List:
- Position and spatial arrangement of sushi pieces
- Overall shape formed by the sushi (from map to human figure)
- Relative placement of sushi within the composition

Step 2- Determine the elements that should remain unchanged  
Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements: The sushi pieces themselves are composed of distinct types identifiable by their unique visual features—such as the orange-pink color and grainy texture of salmon nigiri, the cylindrical shape and green filling of cucumber maki, the black seaweed wrapping, and the white rice layer. These are core identity features of the sushi types. Changing these would make them unrecognizable as sushi. Even though their arrangement changes, their individual identities must be preserved.  

Functional/logical association elements: The sushi pieces serve as building blocks; their function is to represent food items. If their material or type were altered (e.g., replaced with pasta or meat), the logical coherence of the scene (a sushi-based artwork) would be broken. The glass of water and the plate are part of the dining context and support the realism of the scene. Their presence maintains functional logic—water is typically served with sushi, and the plate holds the food. Removing or altering them would disrupt the scene’s plausibility.  

Non modified element deduction: After excluding the allowed changes (arrangement and overall shape), all other visual attributes of the sushi (color, texture, type, size, and structure) must remain. The background, plate, and glass are not mentioned for change and are essential for scene consistency. Therefore, they must be retained.

Preservation Targets List:  
- The presence and visual identity of salmon nigiri (orange-pink color, textured surface, oval shape)  
- The presence and visual identity of maki rolls (cylindrical shape, visible rice, green or yellow fillings)  
- The presence and visual identity of seaweed-wrapped sushi (black outer layer, defined edges)  
- The white rectangular plate with rounded corners  
- The clear glass of water in the top-left corner  
- The dark marbled background with gray veining  
- The relative position and scale of the glass and plate in the scene  

Q1:  
Thinking process: The salmon nigiri is a core component of the sushi arrangement and is identifiable by its distinct orange-pink color, grainy texture, and oval shape. It is a key visual identifier of the sushi type used in the original image. If this feature is lost or altered (e.g., replaced with tuna or changed to red), the sushi would no longer be recognizable as salmon nigiri, undermining the authenticity of the food representation. This is a core identity element, hence weighted at 3 points.  
Question: Is the salmon nigiri present with its characteristic orange-pink color and textured surface?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: Maki rolls are another fundamental sushi type in the image, distinguishable by their cylindrical shape, visible rice layer, and internal fillings such as green cucumber or yellow-orange ingredients. Their structural form is essential for identifying the sushi variety. Altering their shape or filling would misrepresent the food. This is a key accessory element in the composition, critical for maintaining the sushi theme, thus weighted at 3 points.  
Question: Are maki rolls present with visible cylindrical shapes and green or yellow-orange fillings?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: Seaweed-wrapped sushi pieces are identifiable by their black outer layer and defined edges, often forming a border around rice or other fillings. This texture and color are unique to nori-wrapped sushi and are essential for distinguishing it from other types. Losing this feature would alter the visual identity of the sushi. This is a core recognition element, so it is weighted at 3 points.  
Question: Are there sushi pieces with a black seaweed outer layer and defined edges?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The white rectangular plate with rounded corners is a key scene element that supports the presentation of the sushi. Its shape, color, and position are consistent with standard serving platters. Changing its color or shape would disrupt the visual coherence of the dining setup. While not a food item, it is a functional and logical element of the scene, so it is weighted at 2 points.  
Question: Is the white rectangular plate with rounded corners present and positioned centrally on the dark surface?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The clear glass of water in the top-left corner is a contextual detail that enhances the realism of the scene. Its transparency, liquid content, and placement are consistent with typical sushi service. Removing or altering it would affect the scene's authenticity. Though minor, it contributes to environmental logic and is therefore weighted at 2 points.  
Question: Is a clear glass containing water positioned in the top-left corner of the frame?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The dark marbled background with gray veining provides contrast and context for the plate and sushi. Its texture and color are distinctive and contribute to the overall aesthetic. Altering it would change the environment and potentially distract from the main subject. This is a secondary but important environmental detail, so it is weighted at 1 point.  
Question: Is the background a dark surface with visible gray veining resembling marble?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The relative positioning of the glass and plate is important for scene logic. The glass is placed slightly off-center to the left, maintaining a natural dining arrangement. Changing this could make the composition feel unnatural. This is a minor but coherent spatial relationship, so it is weighted at 1 point.  
Question: Is the glass of water located in the top-left corner, separate from the plate but within the same frame?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1
