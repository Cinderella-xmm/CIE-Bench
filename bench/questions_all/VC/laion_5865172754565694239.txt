Description of reference image: The subject is a red Ducati Sport bicycle, positioned in profile view facing right. The frame is bright red with white "DUCATI" lettering prominently displayed along the down tube and smaller "DUCATI" branding on the seat stay. The word "SPORT" appears in white on the top tube near the head tube. Below the bottom bracket, the word "TECH" is visible in white. The bike features black components including the saddle, handlebars, grips, pedals, crankset, chainrings, derailleurs, and brake levers. It has thin black tires with silver reflective sidewall stripes and multiple spokes per wheel. The drivetrain includes a chain, rear derailleur, cassette, and front chainring. The fork is red, matching the frame, and the brakes are rim-mounted with cables running from the handlebars to the wheels. The background is plain white, with no environmental or contextual elements.

Thinking process:  
First, analyze the editing instructions:  
- "Create a vibrant, animated character from this Ducati bike" → implies transformation of the bike into a cartoon-like anthropomorphic figure.  
- "Give it a cheeky, expressive face on the frame near the handlebars" → adds facial features, altering the frame's appearance.  
- "Cartoon-style limbs emerging from the hubs" → modifies the wheels by adding limbs, changing their visual form.  
- "Add dynamic motion lines to emphasize speed" → introduces new graphical elements not present in original.  
- "Turn the red frame into a hero suit" → changes the symbolic interpretation of the frame color and design but does not specify altering the actual red color itself.  
- "Overlay comic-style speed sound effects like 'Vroom!' and 'Zoom!'" → adds text and sound effect graphics.

From this, we determine:
- **Allowed Changes**: 
  - Facial features (eyes, mouth) added to the frame near the handlebars.
  - Limbs drawn from the hubs (wheels).
  - Motion lines around the bike.
  - Sound effect text ("Vroom!", "Zoom!") overlaid.
  - Interpretation of the red frame as a "hero suit" — this is metaphorical and stylistic, not literal change to color or shape unless specified.
  - No restriction on adding new visual elements; the instruction explicitly calls for animation and comic styling.

Thus, **allowed changes** include:
(Specific element 1 that allows for changes): Addition of a cartoon face near the handlebars  
(Specific element 2 that allows for changes): Cartoon limbs extending from the wheel hubs  
(Specific element 3 that allows for changes): Dynamic motion lines indicating speed  
(Specific element 4 that allows for changes): Comic-style sound effects ("Vroom!", "Zoom!")  
(Specific element 5 that allows for changes): Stylistic reinterpretation of the frame as a hero suit (but not necessarily changing its actual red color)

Step 2 – Determine the elements that should remain unchanged

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements:  
- The **Ducati brand name** is critical for identity. Its presence and placement (on down tube and seat stay) must be preserved because it is the primary identifier of the product. Even if stylized, the text must remain readable and in correct position.
- The **"SPORT" label** on the top tube is part of the model designation and contributes to brand-specific identification.
- The **"TECH" label** below the bottom bracket is a secondary branding detail that supports model identity.
- The **red color of the frame** is iconic for Ducati and essential for brand recognition. While the instruction says "turn the red frame into a hero suit", this likely refers to thematic styling rather than changing the base color. Therefore, the red color should still be retained as the dominant hue.
- The **overall structural layout** of the bike — such as the diamond frame geometry, position of the chainstays, seat stays, and drivetrain — must remain intact to preserve functional logic and mechanical coherence. Even in cartoon form, the bike must still resemble a real bicycle in basic structure.
- The **black components** (saddle, handlebars, pedals, etc.) are consistent with the original design and help distinguish the bike’s parts. While they may be stylized, their positions and general shapes should remain recognizable.
- The **tire design**, including black rubber with silver reflective stripes, is a distinct visual feature that contributes to the bike’s modern aesthetic and must be preserved in form even if exaggerated.

Functional/logical association elements:  
- The **chain and drivetrain** must maintain their relative positions and connection between crankset and rear cassette. This ensures logical function is preserved — even in an animated scene, a bike must still appear to have working gears.
- The **wheel hub locations** are where limbs emerge, but the hubs themselves must still exist and be visually identifiable as such, since they are central to the bike’s mechanics and serve as anchor points for limbs.

Non-modified element deduction:  
After excluding allowed modifications (face, limbs, motion lines, sound effects), all remaining **original visual details** — especially textual branding, color scheme, frame shape, component placement, and tire design — must be preserved to maintain authenticity and coherence.

Preservation Targets List:  
(Ducati logo on the down tube)  
(Ducati logo on the seat stay)  
("SPORT" text on the top tube)  
("TECH" text below the bottom bracket)  
(Red color of the frame)  
(Black saddle and handlebars)  
(Chain and drivetrain layout)  
(Tire design with silver reflective stripe)  
(Wheel hub positions)  
(Frame geometry — diamond-shaped structure)

    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The "DUCATI" logo on the down tube is the most prominent branding element and core identifier of the product. If this text is removed or altered beyond recognition, the bike can no longer be identified as a Ducati, undermining the entire brand identity. Its white color and diagonal placement along the red frame are distinctive. Thus, preserving this exact text and position is essential for recognition.
    Question: Is the "DUCATI" text in white lettering clearly visible along the down tube of the frame?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The "DUCATI" logo on the seat stay is a secondary but important branding element that reinforces the brand identity. Though smaller, it is consistently placed in the original design and helps confirm authenticity. Removing or distorting it would reduce brand recognition.
    Question: Is the "DUCATI" text in white lettering visible on the seat stay?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The "SPORT" text on the top tube near the head tube identifies the specific model line. This is a key functional descriptor for the bike’s classification. Its absence would make the model ambiguous and reduce the accuracy of the product representation.
    Question: Is the word "SPORT" in white lettering present on the top tube near the head tube?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The "TECH" label below the bottom bracket is a minor but intentional branding detail that indicates technological features. While less prominent, it contributes to the full product identity. Its removal would represent a loss of detail that could affect authenticity.
    Question: Is the word "TECH" in white lettering visible below the bottom bracket?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The red color of the frame is iconic to Ducati and essential for brand recognition. Even though the instruction suggests turning it into a "hero suit," the underlying red color must remain as the base tone to preserve identity. Any significant deviation (e.g., changing to blue or gray) would misrepresent the product.
    Question: Is the main frame of the bicycle predominantly red in color?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The black saddle and handlebars are standard components that contrast with the red frame and are part of the bike’s design language. Their presence and color are important for visual balance and component identification. Changing them to other colors or removing them would alter the bike’s appearance significantly.
    Question: Are the saddle and handlebars black in color?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The chain and drivetrain layout (crankset, chain, rear derailleur, cassette) must remain structurally coherent to reflect the bike’s functionality. Even in an animated version, the chain must connect the front and rear sprockets properly. Disrupting this would break the mechanical logic of the bike.
    Question: Is the chain visibly connecting the front crankset to the rear cassette?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q8: 
    Thinking process: The tire design, specifically the black rubber with a silver reflective stripe, is a distinctive aesthetic feature that contributes to the modern look of the bike. This detail is not universal across bicycles and thus helps identify this particular model. Altering or omitting the stripe would reduce visual fidelity.
    Question: Do both tires have a silver reflective stripe along the sidewall?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}
{
    Q9: 
    Thinking process: The wheel hubs are the attachment points for the spokes and are critical mechanical components. Even if limbs emerge from them, the hubs themselves must still be visually present and correctly positioned at the center of each wheel to maintain structural logic.
    Question: Are the wheel hubs clearly visible at the center of both front and rear wheels?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q10: 
    Thinking process: The diamond-shaped frame geometry (top tube, down tube, seat tube, chainstays, seat stays) defines the structural integrity and typical road bike form. Altering this shape would make the bike unrecognizable as a conventional bicycle. Preservation ensures the object remains a plausible bike, even when animated.
    Question: Does the frame maintain a diamond-shaped structure with connected top, down, seat, and chain stays?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
