### Description of Reference Image:
The subject is a translucent, vivid green gummy bear-shaped object placed centrally on a black plate. The gummy bear has a rounded form with distinct features like small ears, a smiling face, and paw prints on its feet. The plate is decorated with scattered colorful flower petals in shades of purple, orange, and yellow. The background is a neutral, textured surface that does not distract from the subject.

### Thinking Process:
The instructions specify transforming the gummy bear into a fantasy creature while retaining its core identity and the floral plate setting. The gummy bear's translucent green material, rounded form, and whimsical vibe are key elements that define its identity. The plate and petals provide context and should be retained to maintain scene consistency. Functional elements like the gummy bear's posture and the plate's position relative to it must also be preserved.

### Allowed Changes List:
- The gummy bear can be redesigned as a cute or stylish fantasy creature inspired by its current form.
- A new orb or capsule can be added at its feet, designed to complement the green and floral theme.
- The creature's name and elemental type can be added as text elements.
- The illustration style can be adjusted to resemble retro Japanese RPG monster art.

### Thinking Process for Determining Unchanged Elements:
Core recognition elements include the gummy bear's translucent green material, rounded form, and whimsical vibe. These features are essential for recognizing the creature as inspired by a gummy bear. Functional/logical elements like the creature's posture on the plate and the plate's position relative to the background must be retained. Remaining elements like the scattered petals contribute to visual coherence and should be kept.
