Description of reference image: The image depicts a sunny beach scene with two individuals—a woman and a man—interacting with a white SUV parked on the sand. The woman, wearing a white straw hat, a sleeveless top, and denim shorts, leans casually against the vehicle. The man, dressed in a red shirt, beige shorts, and a wide-brimmed hat, sits atop the hood of the SUV, holding a camera up to his face as he captures the ocean view. The background showcases a picturesque beach setting with gentle waves, a sandy shore, and a rocky hillside under a partly cloudy sky.

### Step 1 - Allowed Changes List:

Thinking process: The instructions specify transforming the scene into a bronze diorama, which implies changing the material and texture of the subjects, clothing, vehicle, and surroundings. However, the relaxed poses, the interaction with the vehicle, and the general composition of the scene should remain consistent. The ocean, sand, and sky may also be reimagined in bronze, but their forms and positions should stay intact.

Allowed Changes List:
Specific element 1 that allows for changes: Material and texture of the subjects, clothing, vehicle, and surroundings (transformed into bronze).
Specific element 2 that allows for changes: Color tones and lighting effects to match the bronze diorama aesthetic.

### Step 2 - Preservation Targets List:

Thinking process: Core recognition elements include the relaxed poses of the individuals, their interaction with the vehicle, and the beach setting. Functional/logical association elements involve the woman leaning against the car and the man sitting on the hood while taking a photo. Remaining elements, such as the specific clothing styles and the vehicle's structure, contribute to visual coherence.

Preservation Targets List:
(Element 1 that should be maintained): The woman's pose of leaning against the SUV.
(Element 2 that should be maintained): The man's pose of sitting on the hood and holding a camera.
(Element 3 that should be maintained): The white SUV's structural integrity and its position on the beach.
(Element 4 that should be maintained): The beach setting with waves, sand, and sky.
(Element 5 that should be maintained): The clothing styles and hats of both individuals.
