**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a vintage brass compass resting on a dark, weathered wooden surface. The compass has a circular brass casing with an outer ring marked with degree increments (0–360°), cardinal directions (N, E, S, W), and intermediate points. The face of the compass features a blue-toned dial with radiating lines and a golden magnetic needle pointing north. A small loop handle is attached at the top for portability. To the left of the compass lies a partially open, rusted metal case with visible hinges and latches, suggesting it once housed the compass. Scattered around the compass are several fragmented pieces of an old, yellowed parchment map, featuring intricate hand-drawn cartographic details such as compass roses, latitude/longitude lines, and stylized landmasses. The map fragments appear aged, with torn edges and faded ink. The overall lighting is dim and directional, casting soft shadows and emphasizing textures—especially the grain of the wood, the patina on the brass, and the creases in the paper.

Thinking process:  
The editing instruction explicitly states to **transform the compass into a luxury perfume bottle design**, which implies that the **form and function of the compass itself will be altered**. However, it specifies **retaining key visual elements** from the original compass and integrating them into the new object. Specifically:
- The **compass face** is to be preserved as an **embossed pattern** on the glass container.
- The **needle** is replaced by a **metal spray nozzle**, indicating the needle's form is discarded but its position or symbolic role may be preserved.
- The **body** becomes a **circular glass container**, so the physical material changes but the shape remains similar.
- The **cap** is to feature **vintage map-engraved details**, referencing the existing map fragments.
- A **bronze-toned gradient finish** is applied for aesthetic continuity.
- **Minimalist branding** is added around the rim — this is new content not present in the original.

From this, we can infer:
- The **overall circular shape** of the compass is retained (as the base of the perfume bottle).
- The **compass face design** (including markings, cardinal directions, radial lines) must remain visually identifiable as embossed.
- The **map fragments** are referenced in the cap design — thus, their **visual style** (e.g., cartographic patterns, compass roses) should be preserved in the engraving.
- The **wooden background** and **rusty case** are not mentioned in the instructions, so they are **not required to be retained** — allowed to change or be removed.
- The **fragments of the map** are not directly transformed but used as inspiration; therefore, their **exact placement or condition** is not required to persist.

Allowed Changes List:  
- The **material** of the compass body (from brass to glass).  
- The **function** of the object (from navigation tool to perfume dispenser).  
- The **presence and form** of the needle (replaced by a spray nozzle).  
- The **position and existence** of the map fragments (used only as design inspiration, not required to remain physically present).  
- The **case** (can be removed or modified).  
- The **background scene** (wooden table, lighting, shadows) — not specified for retention, so may be changed.  
- The **addition of branding text** — new element not in original.  
- The **color tone** of the object (now bronze-gradient) — allowed modification.

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

Thinking process:  
We now apply exclusion logic based on the "Allowed Changes List" to identify what **must be preserved** in the edited image, grounded strictly in the original visual content.

**Core recognition elements:**  
The compass is defined by its **circular brass casing**, **degree markings**, **cardinal direction labels (N, E, S, W)**, **radial star-shaped design**, and **magnetic needle**. Even though the needle is replaced, the **design of the face** is explicitly instructed to be preserved as an **embossed pattern**. Therefore, the **layout and structure of the compass face** must remain unchanged in form and content — this is essential for identity preservation.

**Functional/logical association elements:**  
The compass face serves as a navigational interface. Its transformation into an embossed design on a perfume bottle maintains the **iconic layout** of the original, preserving symbolic meaning. The **relationship between the compass face and the surrounding ring** must be maintained — the scale, orientation, and radial symmetry are critical for recognition.

**Non-modified element deduction:**  
Although the map fragments are not required to remain physically in the scene, their **visual motifs** (such as compass roses, gridded lines, and cartographic symbols) are referenced in the **cap design**. Thus, these **specific cartographic patterns** must be retained in the new cap — even if not as physical objects, their **visual identity** must be preserved. This ensures consistency with the original scene’s theme.

Additionally, the **circular form** of the compass body is preserved in the glass container — a key structural element. While the material changes, the **shape and proportion** must remain consistent to maintain visual coherence.

Preservation Targets List:  
- The **circular brass casing** of the compass (shape and proportions).  
- The **degree markings (0–360°)** along the outer edge.  
- The **cardinal directions (N, E, S, W)** labeled on the face.  
- The **radial star-like pattern** with fine lines emanating from the center.  
- The **cartographic design elements** from the map fragments (e.g., compass roses, grid lines, curved borders) — to be preserved in the engraved cap.  
- The **relative spatial arrangement** of the compass face within the casing (centered, symmetrical).

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The presence of the **cardinal direction labels (N, E, S, W)** is a core identification feature of any compass. These letters are clearly visible in the original image and define the compass’s navigational function. If they are omitted or replaced in the transformed design, the object would no longer be recognizable as derived from a compass. Since the instruction requires the compass face to be preserved as an embossed pattern, these labels must remain intact in form and position. Their loss would fundamentally alter the identity of the source object, making this a high-weight element.
    Question: Are the cardinal direction labels N, E, S, and W clearly visible and correctly positioned on the embossed compass face of the perfume bottle?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The **degree markings (0–360°)** along the outer ring are another defining characteristic of the compass. They provide precision and are integral to its functionality. The instruction specifies retaining the compass face as an embossed pattern, which includes all its original markings. Removing or distorting these numbers would compromise the authenticity of the transformation and break the connection to the original object. This is a key structural and functional detail, hence high weight.
    Question: Is the full 360-degree scale with numerical markings (e.g., 0, 90, 180, 270) present and evenly spaced around the outer edge of the embossed compass face?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The **radial star-like pattern** with multiple arms extending from the center is a distinctive visual motif of the compass face. It represents the wind rose or directional indicator. This pattern is central to the compass’s aesthetic and symbolic identity. Even though the needle is replaced by a nozzle, the underlying star design must remain unaltered in structure and symmetry to preserve the original look. Its absence would make the transformation unrecognizable as originating from the original compass.
    Question: Does the embossed compass face retain the original eight-pointed star-like radial pattern with symmetrical arms extending from the center?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The **circular shape** of the compass is fundamental to its identity. The instruction specifies a "circular glass container," confirming the shape is preserved. Any deviation in shape (e.g., oval, square) would violate the transformation logic and lose the core visual identity. While material changes, the **roundness and proportional dimensions** must remain consistent. This is a structural core element.
    Question: Is the body of the perfume bottle perfectly circular in shape, matching the original compass’s outline?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The **cartographic patterns** from the map fragments — particularly the compass rose and gridded lines — are referenced in the cap design. These are not just decorative but serve as thematic anchors linking the perfume bottle to the original scene. Although the fragments themselves may not appear, their **visual motifs must be replicated** in the cap’s engraving. Losing these would disconnect the new object from the original context and reduce thematic coherence.
    Question: Does the cap of the perfume bottle feature engraved cartographic details such as a compass rose and intersecting grid lines, matching those seen on the map fragments?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The **central pivot point** where the needle was originally mounted is a key structural detail. In the original, it is a small metallic knob. The instruction replaces the needle with a spray nozzle, but the **position and appearance of the central hub** are likely preserved as part of the embossed design. Its removal or relocation would disrupt the symmetry and visual integrity of the compass face. Though not the most critical, it contributes to fidelity.
    Question: Is there a small central raised dot or hub at the exact center of the embossed compass face, corresponding to the original needle pivot?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}
{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The **outer ring with measurement markings** (degrees and directional labels) must be preserved as part of the embossed pattern. The instruction specifies the compass face is retained, so the **ring’s width, texture, and labeling** must remain consistent. Any distortion or omission would affect readability and recognition. This is a minor but necessary detail for visual accuracy.
    Question: Is the outer ring of the embossed compass face clearly delineated with fine engravings and consistent spacing between degree marks?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
