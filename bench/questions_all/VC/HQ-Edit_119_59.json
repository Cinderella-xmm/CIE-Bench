      "thinking_process": "The presence of the barbell rod is fundamental to the action depicted — a weightlifter performing a lift. Even if weights are replaced with icons, the central rod must remain to maintain functional logic. Its absence would make the pose meaningless. This is a core identity element tied to the subject’s action and role, hence weighted at 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the barbell rod visibly present and gripped by both hands across the lifter's upper back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The subject’s muscular build is the defining characteristic of a weightlifter in this context. While exaggerated in cartoon style, the existence of defined muscles (especially biceps, triceps, deltoids, quads) is necessary for recognition. Losing this would transform the subject into a non-athlete, undermining the theme. Thus, it is a core identity feature.",
      "question": "Are the lifter’s arms and legs clearly defined with prominent muscle mass, particularly in the biceps, triceps, and quadriceps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The mirror is a key environmental element referenced in the instruction (“fill the reflection”), meaning it must exist in the scene. Although its reflection content changes, the mirror itself must remain for logical consistency — otherwise, the “reflection” directive becomes invalid. This is an important scene element affecting overall composition.",
      "question": "Is there a vertical mirror surface positioned behind the lifter, reflecting part of his body and surroundings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The subject’s footwear (black athletic shoes) is a specific detail that contributes to identity and realism. Though style may be adjusted, the basic form and color (black sneakers) should be retained for continuity. It is not a core identity feature but a key accessory that aids recognition within the gym context.",
      "question": "Does the lifter wear black athletic shoes with visible laces and a sporty design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The knee-high socks with two white horizontal stripes are a unique detail that distinguishes the outfit. These are not generic — they are specific to the original image. Retaining them ensures visual fidelity and prevents confusion with other athletes’ gear. They are minor but significant for detail coherence.",
      "question": "Do the lifter’s socks extend above the ankle and feature two distinct white horizontal stripes near the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The subject’s facial features — including short-cropped hair and beard — are essential for identity recognition. Changing these would make the character unrecognizable from the original. While cartoon style may simplify, the presence of these features must be preserved. This is a core identity trait.",
      "question": "Does the lifter have short-cropped hair and a neatly trimmed beard covering the jawline and chin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The lifter’s stance — standing upright with feet shoulder-width apart and knees slightly bent — is crucial to the deadlift/rack pose. This posture conveys effort and balance. Altering it significantly would misrepresent the action. It is a functional element tied to the lifting behavior.",
      "question": "Is the lifter standing with feet flat on the ground, knees slightly bent, and spine straight?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The gym environment includes large windows with grid patterns and visible greenery outside. While stylized, these elements establish location and lighting. Their presence helps anchor the scene. Though not central, their retention supports visual consistency.",
      "question": "Are there large rectangular windows with grid lines visible in the background, showing trees or foliage outside?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The blue exercise mat underfoot is a minor but identifiable detail that grounds the lifter in the gym setting. It is not critical to identity but contributes to scene authenticity. Its absence would reduce visual coherence slightly.",
      "question": "Is there a blue rectangular mat positioned directly beneath the lifter’s feet?",
