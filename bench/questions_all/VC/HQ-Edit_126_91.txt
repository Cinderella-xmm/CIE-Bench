Description of reference image: The subject is a black grand piano positioned centrally in a long, symmetrical corridor with white marble columns and tiled flooring. The piano has a glossy black finish, four tapered legs with decorative casters, and a slightly open lid revealing the internal strings and soundboard. The keyboard is visible with standard white and black keys. The brand name "STEINWAY & SONS" is subtly inscribed on the fallboard above the keyboard. The lid is propped open by a metal support rod. The surrounding environment features evenly spaced vertical columns on both sides, creating a sense of depth and perspective. The floor consists of large square tiles in alternating dark and light shades, reflecting the piano's silhouette. The ceiling is flat with recessed lighting, providing soft illumination from above. The overall atmosphere is minimalist, elegant, and architectural, emphasizing symmetry and clean lines.

Thinking process:  
First, analyze the editing instructions to determine what can be changed. The instruction explicitly states to “transform the grand piano into a luxury cosmetics collection ad,” which means the **form and function** of the piano are to be reimagined. Specifically:  
- The **lid** is to become a **compact mirror case**, so its shape and position may change but must still align with the original lid’s location and orientation.  
- The **keyboard** is to be replaced with an **eyeshadow palette**, meaning the keys themselves are no longer required.  
- The **entire body** is to adopt **glossy black textures** across packaging — this implies surface material changes but not necessarily structural form.  
- The **scene** is to remain an **elegant marble hall**, so the **architectural setting** (columns, flooring, lighting) should be preserved in essence.  
- A **refined logo and slogan** are to be added on the piano’s body — this is a new addition, not a replacement of existing elements.

Allowed Changes List:  
- The lid’s interior structure (strings, soundboard) → can be removed or altered  
- The keyboard → can be replaced with eyeshadow palette  
- The lid’s functional opening mechanism → can be modified for compact mirror use  
- Surface texture of piano → can be adjusted to glossy black (but must retain general shape)  
- Brand name ("STEINWAY & SONS") → may be obscured or replaced with logo/slogan  
- Internal mechanics (hinges, pedals) → can be stylized or removed if needed  

Step 2 – Determine the elements that should remain unchanged

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements:  
- The **overall shape and silhouette** of the grand piano is essential for identity. Even though it transforms into a cosmetic product, it must still resemble a grand piano in outline to maintain visual continuity and fulfill the transformation premise. The **curved side profile**, **four-legged base**, and **proportionate length** are iconic features that define a grand piano. If these are lost, the object ceases to be recognizable as a piano-based design.  
- The **positioning within the corridor** is critical: the piano is centered, facing forward, aligned with the vanishing point. This spatial logic supports the elegance and symmetry emphasized in the scene. Changing this would disrupt the composition and undermine the intended aesthetic.  
- The **flooring pattern** (alternating dark and light tiles) contributes to the sense of depth and reflection. Its preservation maintains environmental coherence and helps anchor the object in space.  
- The **columnar architecture** (white, vertical, evenly spaced) defines the hallway’s character. It must be retained to satisfy the requirement of an “elegant marble hall.” Altering column spacing, color, or form would break the scene’s integrity.  

Functional/logical association elements:  
- The **piano’s placement in the center of the corridor** establishes a logical relationship between the object and its environment. Moving it off-center or changing its orientation would violate the implied balance and symmetry.  
- The **relationship between the piano and the light source** (ceiling lights casting soft shadows) affects how reflections and highlights appear. While lighting can be adjusted slightly, the directional shadow pattern on the floor should be preserved to maintain realism and depth.  

Non-modified element deduction:  
After excluding allowed changes (lid content, keyboard, brand text), the remaining **structural form** of the piano — including leg shape, curve of the body, lid hinge line, and overall proportions — must remain. These are not mentioned as changeable and are necessary for visual consistency. Similarly, the **marble-like walls**, **tile pattern**, and **perspective lines** of the corridor are not specified for alteration and thus must be preserved.  

Preservation Targets List:  
- The curved silhouette and four-legged structure of the grand piano  
- The central positioning of the piano within the corridor  
- The alternating dark and light tiled floor pattern  
- The evenly spaced white columns forming the corridor  
- The soft overhead lighting creating subtle shadows and reflections  
- The reflective surface of the piano’s exterior (glossy black finish)  
- The overall symmetry and linear perspective of the scene

    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The curved silhouette of the grand piano is the core identity feature that distinguishes it from other instruments. Its distinctive shape — especially the rounded right side and elongated left side — is essential for recognition. Even when transformed into a cosmetic item, the overall outline must remain consistent to preserve the conceptual link. Losing this shape would make the object unrecognizable as derived from a piano, making it a key element with a weight of 3 points.
    Question: Is the curved side profile of the grand piano preserved, maintaining its characteristic gentle arc and elongated form?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The four tapered legs with decorative casters are unique structural identifiers of this specific piano model. Their presence, position, and ornamental feet contribute to the instrument’s classical elegance. Removing or altering them would change the object’s identity and undermine the authenticity of the transformation. This is a key structural detail, hence weighted at 3 points.
    Question: Are the four tapered legs with decorative casters present and positioned beneath the piano body as in the original?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The central alignment of the piano within the corridor is crucial for maintaining the symmetrical composition and depth perception. This spatial relationship is part of the scene’s visual logic. Shifting the piano off-center or rotating it would disrupt the intended elegance and perspective, affecting overall consistency. Therefore, this positional element is important and assigned a weight of 2.
    Question: Is the piano positioned directly in the center of the corridor, aligned with the vanishing point created by the columns?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The alternating dark and light square tiles on the floor create a distinct visual rhythm and contribute to the reflective quality of the space. This pattern is a defining feature of the environment and supports the sense of depth and luxury. Changing the tile layout or colors would alter the scene’s character. While not the most critical element, it is significant enough to affect coherence, thus assigned a weight of 2.
    Question: Is the floor composed of large square tiles arranged in a repeating pattern of alternating dark and light shades?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The evenly spaced white columns lining both sides of the corridor are essential to the architectural identity of the scene. They establish the marble hall environment required by the instruction. Any deviation in spacing, height, or color would compromise the scene’s elegance and symmetry. This is a major environmental feature, so it is assigned a weight of 3.
    Question: Are there tall, evenly spaced white columns extending along both sides of the corridor, forming a symmetrical passage?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The glossy black finish of the piano’s exterior is a key visual attribute that contributes to its luxurious appearance. Although the instruction allows for a glossy black texture across packaging, the original sheen and reflective quality must be maintained to preserve the high-end aesthetic. Loss of this texture would reduce the perceived exclusivity. This is a surface-level but important detail, assigned a weight of 2.
    Question: Does the piano retain a highly reflective, glossy black surface that mirrors the surrounding environment?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The soft overhead lighting creates subtle shadows and highlights, particularly under the piano and on the floor. This lighting setup contributes to the mood and realism of the scene. While the intensity might be adjusted, the direction and resulting shadow pattern must remain consistent to preserve depth and spatial accuracy. This is a minor but coherent detail, assigned a weight of 1.
    Question: Are soft shadows cast beneath the piano and along the floor, consistent with overhead lighting from above?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
