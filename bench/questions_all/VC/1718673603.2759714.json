      "thinking_process": "The tiered roof with upward-curving eaves and decorative ridge elements is a defining architectural feature of traditional Japanese buildings. Its shape and structure are essential for identifying the building type. Even when converted to stained glass, the silhouette must remain intact. Loss of this would make the structure unrecognizable as Japanese architecture, hence a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the two-tiered roof with upward-curving eaves and ornamental ridge details preserved in the same structural outline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The large red moon is a central visual anchor and mood-setting element. Its position in the upper center and its vivid red color are critical for scene recognition. While its texture may change to gradient circles, its placement and hue must remain consistent. Removing or relocating it would fundamentally alter the scene’s identity, justifying a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the large red moon positioned in the upper center of the sky and retaining its dominant red color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The red trees on either side of the building are key compositional elements that frame the structure and enhance symmetry. Though they are to be transformed into floral motifs, their lateral positioning and red coloration must be preserved to maintain balance and thematic consistency. Changing their location would disrupt the scene’s harmony, making this a high-priority retention point.",
      "question": "Are there two red-colored trees symmetrically placed on the left and right sides of the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The pond in the foreground reflects the building, trees, and moon, serving as a vital compositional element. Its presence ensures visual depth and symmetry. Even if stylized, its position and reflective function must be retained. Removing it would break the scene’s spatial logic and reduce coherence, warranting a weight of 2 points.",
      "question": "Is there a reflective body of water in the foreground mirroring the building and moon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The stone staircase leading from the building to the pond establishes physical connection and spatial hierarchy. Its path and steps are visible and functional in the original. While material may change, the step sequence and direction must remain to preserve logical access and perspective. This is a secondary but important structural detail, so it receives a weight of 1 point.",
      "question": "Are there stone steps descending from the building platform toward the pond?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The lit windows with warm orange glow are distinctive features indicating interior activity and contributing to the building’s inviting ambiance. Their number, placement (e.g., second-floor balcony, ground-floor shoji), and illuminated state must be preserved. Altering them would affect the building’s character and realism, making this a key detail worth 2 points.",
      "question": "Are the windows on the building emitting a warm orange light, particularly on the upper and lower levels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The garden layout, including low shrubs and trimmed greenery around the building and pond, contributes to the scene’s serenity and authenticity. These elements provide environmental context and must remain in relative position. While stylized, their presence and arrangement help maintain visual coherence. This is a supporting detail, so it receives 1 point.",
      "question": "Are there low green shrubs and manicured plants surrounding the base of the building and pond?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
