Description of reference image: 
The subject is a bathroom vanity setup featuring a double-sink arrangement with a white shaker-style cabinet. The countertop is made of marble with a light beige tone. Two black faucets and matching handles complement the design. Above the sinks are two large rectangular mirrors framed in black, accompanied by wall-mounted lights that cast a warm glow. A decorative metallic gold planter with green foliage sits on the left side of the countertop. The walls are painted white, providing a clean and minimalist backdrop. A towel hangs neatly on a black towel ring mounted on the right wall.

Thinking process: 
The editing instructions indicate a transformation of perspective, requiring a top-down and angled side view illustration of the sink structure. This primarily affects the layout and orientation while retaining the core elements like the sink, faucets, and cabinetry. The background and certain scene elements may be altered or removed due to the new perspectives.

### Allowed Changes List:
1. Perspective of the vanities: changing the current frontal view to a top-down and angled side view.
2. Background details: simplifying or omitting non-essential elements like the wall-mounted lights, mirror reflections, and towels due to new viewing angles.
3. Layout proportions: adjusting the relative sizes and positions of the sink components and cabinetry to fit the new perspectives.

### Thinking process:
Core recognition elements include the sink basins, the shaker-style cabinets, the light-colored marble countertop, and the black faucets. These define the subject's identity as a double-sink vanity unit. Functional/logical elements include the logical placement of faucets over the sinks and the consistent cabinet design across both views. Non-modified elements like the gold planter and wall-mounted towel ring contribute to scene coherence and should be retained unless their presence disrupts the new perspective.

### Preservation Targets List:
1. The form and design of the double sink basins.
2. The shaker-style white cabinetry.
3. The light-colored marble countertop texture and color.
4. The black faucet design and placement.
5. The general layout and alignment of the vanity compartments.
