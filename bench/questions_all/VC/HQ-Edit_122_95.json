      "thinking_process": "The presence of two identical women is the defining feature of the image. Removing or altering their number or gender would destroy the core identity of the scene. The instruction does not state merging or replacing them, only changing their pose and style. Thus, the existence of two distinct female figures is a core identity element. Losing one would make the image unrecognizable as a faithful adaptation.",
      "question": "Are there two female figures present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The symmetrical arrangement of the two figures is essential to the original composition. The instruction mentions transforming the pose but not breaking symmetry. Ecclesiastical poses in Byzantine art often maintain balance, so symmetry is likely preserved. Breaking this would disrupt the visual harmony and identity of the scene.",
      "question": "Are the two figures positioned symmetrically relative to the central axis of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The Taj Mahal’s dome is an iconic identifier. Even if transformed into a basilica, the presence of a large central dome is required to maintain the reference to the original site. The instruction specifies “domed basilica,” confirming the dome’s retention. Losing this would remove the architectural anchor of the scene.",
      "question": "Is there a large central dome visible at the end of the pathway?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The arched entryway frames the entire scene and provides depth. It is a key structural element. The instruction does not mention removing it, and the mosaic transformation likely retains it as a border. Its absence would break the compositional framing.",
      "question": "Is there an arched stone entrance framing the view of the central structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The water channel is a defining feature of the Taj Mahal’s garden layout. Even if stylized, its linear path from foreground to background maintains spatial logic. The instruction implies a transformed but continuous path, so its presence and direction should be preserved.",
      "question": "Is there a straight water channel running from the foreground to the central structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The red and gold color scheme of the sarees is central to their visual identity. While the pattern changes, the base colors are not mentioned as altered. In mosaic art, these colors would likely be preserved in tesserae form. Changing them would misrepresent the original cultural attire.",
      "question": "Do the sarees retain a dominant red and gold color scheme?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The maang tikka and earrings are distinctive cultural accessories. The instruction does not mention removing them, and in Byzantine-style transformations, such ornaments might be stylized but retained. Their absence would reduce cultural authenticity and visual coherence.",
      "question": "Are gold jewelry pieces, including a forehead ornament (maang tikka) and earrings, visible on both figures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "thinking_process": "The dark hair of the figures is a consistent trait. The instruction allows hairstyle changes but not replacement with light or synthetic hair. Preserving dark hair maintains character consistency.",
      "question": "Do both figures have long, dark hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
