      "thinking_process": "The key recognition feature of the McLaren 720S is its unique front-end design, particularly the sharp, angular LED headlights and the wide, low-profile grille with a central air intake. These elements define the car’s identity and distinguish it from other supercars. Even when rendered as a 3D model, these design features must remain intact to ensure the car is still recognizable as a McLaren 720S. Their absence or distortion would make identification impossible, making this a core identity element.",
      "question": "Does the car retain the distinctive angular LED headlights and central grille intake characteristic of the McLaren 720S?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The curved two-lane road with double yellow lines is a critical spatial guide in the image, defining the direction of travel and reinforcing the sense of motion. Its shape and lane markings establish the context of a coastal highway. Changing the road’s curvature or removing the lane markings would alter the scene’s logic and disrupt the viewer’s understanding of the car’s path. This is an important structural element that supports the narrative of movement along the coast.",
      "question": "Is the road still a curved two-lane highway with continuous double yellow lines running down its center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The left-side hillside with its reddish-brown slopes and patches of autumn-colored vegetation is a defining environmental feature that contrasts with the ocean and contributes to the scenic composition. Its presence and general topography must be preserved to maintain the coastal setting. While texture may change (e.g., to resin), the overall slope shape and vegetation distribution must remain consistent to retain visual continuity.",
      "question": "Is the left-hand hillside still present with its reddish-brown slopes and scattered autumnal vegetation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The right-side guardrail is a functional safety feature that separates the road from the ocean. Its presence maintains logical consistency—without it, the road would appear unsafe or improperly constructed. It also provides a visual boundary that anchors the road’s edge. Removing or altering its position would break the spatial logic of the scene.",
      "question": "Is there a concrete guardrail along the right side of the road, separating it from the ocean?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The car’s position directly on the road, centered in the lane and facing forward, establishes the primary viewpoint and direction of travel. This alignment is crucial for perspective and storytelling. If the car were shifted off-center or rotated, it would disrupt the intended composition and sense of motion. This is a foundational positional element that must remain unchanged.",
      "question": "Is the car positioned centrally on the right side of the road, facing forward toward the horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The distant coastline with rocky outcrops and sea spray is a key background element that completes the coastal scene. These geological features provide depth and reinforce the natural setting. Their removal or replacement with artificial structures would fundamentally alter the environment’s authenticity. While the rendering may change (e.g., to a resin layer), their presence and spatial arrangement must be preserved.",
      "question": "Are rocky outcrops visible in the distant sea, with mist or spray rising near the shore?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The car’s interior, particularly the red racing seats with black trim, is a secondary but identifiable detail that adds to the sporty character of the vehicle. While less critical than the exterior, it contributes to the overall identity of the car as a high-performance model. Its retention helps maintain visual consistency with the original image.",
      "question": "Are the red racing seats with black accents visible through the windshield inside the car?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
