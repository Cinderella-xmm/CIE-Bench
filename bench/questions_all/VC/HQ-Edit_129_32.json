      "thinking_process": "The ornate bow with its symmetrical scrollwork and spherical finials is the most iconic and distinguishing feature of the key. Its complex, baroque-style design is central to the key’s identity and serves as the primary visual motif for the jewelry packaging. Removing or altering this design would make the key unrecognizable and undermine the entire design concept. This element is a core identity feature, hence weighted at 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the ornate bow featuring symmetrical scrollwork and multiple spherical finials present and unchanged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The double-notched bit at the bottom of the key is a functional and visually distinct element that defines its mechanical form. Its shape is unique and contributes to the key's authenticity and heritage appeal. Altering this would disrupt the key’s identity and misrepresent its original design. This is a critical structural feature, thus weighted at 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the double-notched bit at the end of the key preserved in its original H-shaped configuration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The segmented shaft with textured bands is a defining characteristic of the key’s craftsmanship. It adds depth and historical detail, separating it from simpler keys. Losing these bands would simplify the design and reduce its perceived luxury and age. While not as iconic as the bow or bit, it is an essential detail contributing to overall authenticity, hence weighted at 2 points.",
      "question": "Are the textured bands along the shaft preserved in their original placement and form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The aged golden brass color and metallic sheen are essential to the key’s luxurious and antique appearance. Changing the color or removing the patina would alter its mood and historical character, making it inconsistent with the \"heritage centerpiece\" theme. Since the instruction emphasizes \"luxury\" and \"elegance,\" preserving the original hue is crucial. This is a key visual attribute, thus weighted at 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the key rendered in the original aged golden brass tone with visible highlights and shadows indicating metallic texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The precise arrangement of spherical finials and scrollwork in the bow is a detailed but vital component of the key’s symmetry and artistic value. Even small deviations could break the visual harmony and reduce its ornamental quality. These elements are not just decorative—they are part of the key’s signature style. Their retention ensures fidelity to the original design, making them important but secondary to the core features. Thus, weighted at 1 point.",
      "question": "Are the spherical finials positioned symmetrically around the scrollwork in the bow as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The overall proportion and balance of the key—including the relative size of the bow, shaft, and bit—are necessary to maintain its aesthetic integrity. Distorting these proportions would make the key look unnatural or stylized beyond recognition. Although less critical than individual features, proportional accuracy supports visual consistency and realism. Hence, weighted at 1 point.",
      "question": "Is the key proportionally accurate, with the bow, shaft, and bit maintaining their original relative dimensions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
