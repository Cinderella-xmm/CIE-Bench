**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a young girl with short, light brown bobbed hair and bangs, wearing large black-framed glasses. She has a wide, joyful smile showing her teeth, and is dressed in a white lab coat over a navy blue top. Her posture is slightly angled toward the viewer, with her left arm extended outward. The background is a dark green chalkboard surface featuring hand-drawn doodles in red and white chalk, including symbols such as a sun, rocket, planet, teddy bear, paint palette, crayons, question mark, puzzle piece, lollipop, dice, notebook, party hat, and various abstract shapes. Words like "JOYFUL," "CURIOSITY," and "IMAGINATION" are written in uppercase letters among the drawings. The overall composition suggests a playful, educational theme emphasizing creativity and science.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction explicitly states: *"Transform the image into an educational school poster featuring a whimsical, anthropomorphic teddy bear scientist and playful lab equipment illustrations."* This indicates that the **subject (the girl)** will be replaced or transformed into a **teddy bear scientist**, meaning her human form is no longer required to remain. Additionally, the instruction calls for **new elements**: anthropomorphic animals, lab equipment, scientific formulas, vibrant chalk colors, and expressive typography — all suggesting that the **background content can be modified extensively**.

Further, the instruction says: *"Enrich the backdrop with scientific symbols, formulas, and expressive doodles..."*, implying that while some doodles may be retained, they will be **replaced or augmented** with new ones. It also specifies *"delightful animal characters engaging in scientific activities"*, which confirms that the original girl is not required to remain.

Thus, the only elements **not explicitly allowed to change** are those **that must be preserved due to identity or logical consistency** — but since the instruction does **not specify retaining any part of the original subject or scene**, we infer that **everything is open to transformation unless it's a core visual anchor**.

However, note that the instruction **does not require the retention of any specific object from the original image** — so all elements are technically allowed to be changed.

But crucially: **The original image contains unique visual details** that could be lost if not carefully considered. Since the instruction allows full transformation, we proceed under the assumption that **no element is required to be preserved unless it is essential to identity or logic**, and **only elements that are not mentioned as changeable should be retained**.

Yet, because the instruction **does not state that the girl must be removed**, but rather **transforms the image**, we must assess whether her presence is still **logically tied** to the final output. However, since she is being replaced by a **teddy bear scientist**, her existence is **not functionally necessary**.

Therefore, **all elements are allowed to be changed**, except those that are **core identity features of the original image** — but since this is not a well-known artwork, there are no iconic recognition features beyond the **girl’s appearance and the chalkboard background**.

But here's the key: the instruction says *"transform the image"* — meaning the **entire composition is to be reimagined**, not just enhanced. Therefore, **no original element needs to be preserved**, unless it is **explicitly referenced**.

Hence, **no element is required to be preserved**, but we must still identify **which elements might be accidentally lost** if editing is done carelessly.

However, per the task: we are to **identify elements that should be retained** based on the **original image** and the **instruction's allowed changes**.

Since the instruction **does not preserve any element**, **no element is required to be retained**.

But wait: the instruction says *"enrich the backdrop with scientific symbols, formulas, and expressive doodles"*, implying that the **existing doodles may be kept or expanded upon** — but not required.

So: **no mandatory retention**.

But we must still determine **what should be retained** based on **visual coherence and identity**.

Let’s now move to Step 2.

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
We apply the exclusion method:

- **Core recognition elements**: The original image is not a famous artwork, nor does it contain universally recognizable symbolic icons (like Mona Lisa’s smile or Van Gogh’s starry sky). The girl is a real person, not a stylized icon. Therefore, **no irreplaceable core identity features exist** that would make the image unrecognizable if changed.
  
- **Functional/logical association elements**: There is no functional dependency between the girl and the background — she is posed in front of the chalkboard, but not interacting with any specific element in a way that implies causal action (e.g., writing, pointing). Thus, **no functional logic ties her to the background** that must be preserved.

- **Non-modified element deduction**: Since the instruction allows full transformation (e.g., replacing the girl with a teddy bear), **all elements are permitted to change**. Therefore, **nothing must be preserved**.

However, caution: even though the instruction allows transformation, **some visual elements may be used as stylistic references** (e.g., the color scheme, the chalkboard texture, the style of doodles) — but these are **not required to be preserved** unless specified.

Thus, **no element from the original image must be preserved** according to the instructions.

But the task requires us to **identify what should be retained** — so we must consider **if any element is implicitly required**.

Re-examining: the instruction says *"transform the image into an educational school poster"*, using the **original image as a base**. But since it doesn’t say *"keep the girl"* or *"retain the existing doodles"*, we assume **full creative freedom**.

Therefore, **no element must be preserved**.

But wait: the **doodles** include words like "JOYFUL", "CURIOSITY", "IMAGINATION" — these are **themes**. Could they be retained?

Possibly, but the instruction says *"enrich"* — so they may be **replaced or added to**, not necessarily preserved.

Similarly, the **chalkboard texture** is a background feature — could be kept or changed.

So, **no element is mandated to be retained**.

Thus, **Preservation Targets List is empty**.

But this seems counterintuitive — perhaps we need to reconsider.

Wait: the instruction says *"Transform the image into an educational school poster..."*, meaning the **final product should resemble the original in tone and purpose**, but not necessarily in content.

But since it does **not require retention**, we cannot assume preservation.

Therefore, **no element must be preserved**.

But the task asks to generate questions about **retention of edited elements** — so we must find **elements that were present and might be lost**.

Even if not required, we can ask: *Did the editor retain any key visual feature?*

But only if it's **present in the original** and **could be lost**.

So let’s list **key visual features of the original image**:

- Girl with bobbed light brown hair
- Large black-rimmed glasses
- White lab coat
- Navy blue top
- Dark green chalkboard background
- Red and white chalk doodles (sun, rocket, planet, teddy bear, etc.)
- Words: JOYFUL, CURIOSITY, IMAGINATION
- Smiling expression

Now, the instruction says to replace the girl with a **teddy bear scientist** — so **her face, hair, glasses, clothing are all to be changed**.

It says to enrich the backdrop — so **doodles may be added or changed**, but not necessarily kept.

So **none of these are required to be retained**.

But here’s a nuance: the **doodles** are **part of the original design** and **may be reused** in the new version — but not required.

So, **no element must be preserved**.

But the task requires us to **generate questions** about retention — so we must assume that **some elements might be retained**, even if not required.

Therefore, we proceed to **Step 3**, generating questions about **whether certain visual features from the original image are present in the edited version**, even if not required.

But the task says: *"detect the retention of edited elements"*, meaning we are checking **if the edits preserved certain things**.

So, we generate **yes/no questions** about **visual features that existed in the original** and **could be lost** during editing.

Even if not required, we check if they were **accidentally preserved**.

Thus, we go ahead.

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The girl's large black-rimmed glasses are a distinctive facial accessory that contributes to her scientist persona. Their shape (round lenses, thick black frame) is a key visual identifier in the original image. If they are removed or altered, the character’s identity shifts significantly. Although the instruction allows replacement with a teddy bear, the presence of the glasses in the original image makes them a notable detail that could be retained or omitted. Since the instruction does not specify their removal, checking their presence helps verify consistency with the original visual design. This is a minor detail, but visually prominent, hence assigned 2 points.

{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The white lab coat is a central costume element that defines the girl's role as a scientist. Its color (white), collar shape, and visible button on the left side are specific details. While the instruction replaces her with a teddy bear scientist, the lab coat's visual presence in the original image makes it a key component of the scientist aesthetic. If absent in the edited version, it may indicate a deviation from the original concept. This is a significant detail in defining the character’s identity, so its retention is important for visual continuity, even if not required. Assigned 2 points.

{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The dark green chalkboard background is a consistent environmental feature throughout the image. Its deep green hue and matte texture provide contrast for the red and white chalk doodles. Although the instruction allows enrichment with new symbols, the background color and texture are foundational to the educational setting. If changed to another color or texture, the visual context shifts. While not required to be preserved, its retention ensures thematic continuity. This is a major environmental element, so its presence is important for scene coherence. Assigned 2 points.

    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The word "CURIOSITY" written in uppercase letters is a central textual element in the image, positioned near the center-right. Its font style (handwritten, uneven spacing) and placement contribute to the playful educational theme. Although the instruction mentions adding more text and symbols, this specific word may be retained or replaced. Checking its presence helps assess whether key thematic elements from the original are preserved. This is a core thematic word, so its retention affects the message conveyed. Assigned 3 points.

    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The cartoon-style teddy bear doodle with a bow tie is a unique illustration in the image, located near the center-left. Its features—round head, small ears, stitched eyes, and red bow tie—are distinctive. Although the instruction introduces a new anthropomorphic teddy bear scientist, this original doodle may be retained or replaced. Its presence adds to the whimsical tone. As a specific graphic element, its retention helps maintain visual consistency with the original design. Assigned 2 points.
    Question: Is there a cartoon teddy bear with a red bow tie drawn on the chalkboard?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The word "JOYFUL" written in uppercase letters appears in the upper-middle section of the chalkboard. Its placement and font style match the other thematic words. While the instruction encourages joyful learning, this specific word may be replaced or supplemented. Its retention supports continuity in the emotional tone of the image. As a thematic keyword, its presence is significant. Assigned 2 points.
