      "thinking_process": "The red color of the motorcycle is a core identity feature. In the original image, the motorcycle is distinctly red, which differentiates it from other types of bikes and is essential for recognition. If the color were changed to another hue, the vehicle would no longer be identifiable as the same object. This is a key visual identifier, making it a 3-point element.",

      "thinking_process": "The blue color of the truck is a defining characteristic. The vintage truck in the original image is painted light blue, and this color is central to its identity.

Removing or changing its color would alter the rider’s identity.",

      "thinking_process": "The rider’s black leather jacket is a core component of their attire and contributes to the overall look of a professional motorcyclist. The jacket is clearly visible and forms a significant portion of the rider’s upper body. Its absence or replacement with a different color or material would break the continuity of the character’s identity.",

      "thinking_process": "The motorcycle has a transparent windscreen, which is a functional and visual feature of sportbikes. It is positioned above the handlebars and is clearly visible in the original image. Its presence helps identify the bike as a modern sport model. Removing it would change the bike’s classification.",

      "thinking_process": "The truck has round headlights, which are a distinctive design feature of vintage models. These headlights are located on the front bumper and are clearly visible.

      "thinking_process": "The rider is in a forward-leaning posture, which is typical for sportbike riding and indicates motion. This posture is essential for conveying the action and dynamics of the scene. Even in a chibi style, the direction and angle of the lean must be preserved to maintain the sense of movement.",

      "thinking_process": "The motorcycle and truck are positioned side by side on the road, indicating a parallel movement. This spatial relationship is crucial for the narrative of the scene—two vehicles traveling together. Changing their relative positions would disrupt the intended interaction.",
