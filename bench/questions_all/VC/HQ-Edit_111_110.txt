Description of reference image: The subject is a tall, ornately carved wooden bookshelf positioned centrally against a textured gray wall. The bookshelf has two vertical columns with intricate Celtic-style knotwork carvings along the edges and top panels, featuring symmetrical interlacing patterns and floral motifs. Each column contains five horizontal shelves filled with books of varying heights, thicknesses, and colors—predominantly in earthy tones such as brown, tan, and muted reds. Several books display elaborate spine designs resembling runes, spirals, or organic forms, particularly noticeable on central spines in each shelf row. The bottom shelf includes three large, vertically aligned books with highly detailed carvings: one features a circular key-like symbol with swirling lines, another displays a spiral motif, and the third shows a flowing vine-like pattern. The base of the bookshelf has a decorative molding with repeating geometric patterns. The floor beneath is made of light-colored wooden planks running horizontally, and the wall behind the bookshelf has a subtle dotted texture. The lighting is soft and even, casting minimal shadows, highlighting the depth of the carvings.

Thinking process:  
First, analyze the editing instructions word by word:  
- "Transform the bookshelf and books into a LEGO tower" → This indicates the **form** of the entire structure (bookshelf + books) must be replaced with a LEGO construction.  
- "Individually crafted block books in earthy tones" → The books are to be reimagined as LEGO blocks, but color palette remains earthy; thus, **color tone** may be preserved, but **material and form** change.  
- "Use darker bricks to mimic original intricate carvings on the spines and shelves" → The **design details** (carvings) are to be replicated using darker LEGO bricks, meaning **the visual patterns themselves must be retained**, though their medium changes.  
- "Design the tower to gradually taper at the top" → **Shape/structure** changes: the new form tapers upward, unlike the original straight vertical form.  
- "Replace wooden texture with smooth plastic aesthetics" → **Surface texture** of the object changes from wood grain to smooth plastic.  
- "Place it against a plain, muted backdrop" → Background is changed from textured gray wall to plain, muted surface; **background environment is not preserved**.

Thus, the **allowed changes** include:
- Form of the bookshelf (from wooden cabinet to LEGO tower)
- Material (wood → plastic LEGO bricks)
- Surface texture (wood grain → smooth plastic)
- Structural shape (straight → tapered)
- Background (textured wall → plain backdrop)

However, the instruction explicitly says to **mimic** the original carvings using darker bricks, meaning the **visual content of the carvings must be preserved**, even if rendered differently. Therefore, the **patterns** on the spines and frame must remain visually identifiable.

Allowed Changes List:  
- Overall form and structure of the bookshelf (transformed into a LEGO tower)  
- Material and texture (wood → LEGO plastic)  
- Background (textured gray wall → plain muted backdrop)  
- Shape (straight → tapered)  
- Surface finish (natural wood → smooth plastic)  

Step 2 – Determine the elements that should remain unchanged

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements:  
The **intricate carvings**—especially the **Celtic knotwork** on the top panels and sides, the **key-shaped symbol**, **spiral motif**, and **vine-like design** on the lower books—are unique identifiers of the original artistic style and craftsmanship. These are not just decorative; they define the aesthetic identity of the piece. If these patterns are lost or altered beyond recognition, the transformed object would no longer be a faithful reinterpretation of the original. Even though the medium changes, the **visual content of the designs** must be preserved.

Functional/logical association elements:  
There are no functional dependencies (e.g., mechanical parts, actions), but the **arrangement of books** and **symmetry of carvings** contribute to the overall composition and balance. The **relative positioning** of the carved books (especially the three large ones at the bottom) and the **distribution of patterned spines** across shelves creates a visual rhythm that must be maintained for coherence.

Non-modified element deduction:  
After excluding allowed changes (form, material, background, texture), the remaining **visual patterns**—specifically the **carved designs**—must be preserved. These are not mentioned as changeable, and the instruction explicitly states they should be “mimicked,” which implies retention of their **visual essence**.

Preservation Targets List:  
- The presence of the Celtic knotwork patterns on the top and side frames  
- The key-shaped symbol on the leftmost bottom book  
- The spiral motif on the central bottom book  
- The vine-like design on the rightmost bottom book  
- The arrangement of patterned books across shelves (particularly the central alignment of carved spines)  
- The relative size and spacing of the books with detailed carvings

    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The key-shaped symbol on the leftmost book of the bottom shelf is a core visual identifier of the original design, distinguishing it from other books and contributing to the symbolic richness of the scene. Its presence and distinct form (a circular key with swirling arms and a central knob) are essential for recognizing the original artwork’s intent. Losing this would make the transformation unrecognizable as a reinterpretation of the source. Therefore, it is a high-weight core element.
    Question: Is the key-shaped symbol with swirling arms and central knob present on the leftmost book of the bottom shelf?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The spiral motif on the central book of the bottom shelf is another unique carved design that contributes to the thematic consistency of the artwork. It is visually distinct from the other patterns and serves as a focal point. Its absence would disrupt the symmetry and symbolic balance of the lower section, making the recreation inconsistent with the original.
    Question: Is the spiral motif clearly visible on the central book of the bottom shelf?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The vine-like design on the rightmost book of the bottom shelf is a distinctive organic carving that mirrors the naturalistic themes in the upper carvings. It completes the triad of symbolic designs and is crucial for maintaining the original’s visual narrative. Its loss would break the intentional symmetry and thematic unity.
    Question: Is the flowing vine-like pattern present on the rightmost book of the bottom shelf?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The Celtic knotwork patterns on the top panel and vertical sides are iconic elements that define the ornamental style of the bookshelf. Their intricate interlacing is a hallmark of the design and must be preserved even when rendered in LEGO bricks. Without them, the aesthetic identity of the piece is compromised.
    Question: Are the interlacing Celtic knotwork patterns present on the top panel and vertical side frames of the bookshelf?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The arrangement of the three large, carved books at the bottom shelf—left, center, and right—is a deliberate compositional choice that balances the design. Their relative positions and sizes create a visual anchor. Changing their placement or omitting any would distort the original layout and reduce coherence.
    Question: Are the three large books with detailed carvings positioned side by side on the bottom shelf, from left to right?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The presence of multiple books with carved spines across all shelves (not just the bottom) contributes to the overall theme of ornate craftsmanship. While individual books may vary, the consistent appearance of patterned spines maintains visual continuity. Their absence would make the LEGO version appear less faithful to the original's rich detail.
    Question: Are there at least four books with visible carved spines distributed across the middle and upper shelves?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The earthy color palette—comprising browns, tans, and muted reds—is specified in the editing instruction as a requirement ("earthy tones"). Although the material changes, the color scheme is a key attribute of the original and must be preserved to maintain visual harmony and authenticity.
    Question: Are the books and structural elements rendered in earthy tones such as brown, tan, and muted red?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
