**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a clear glass whisky bottle with a rectangular, slightly curved shape, filled with amber-colored liquid. The bottle has a black screw cap and a gold foil seal around the neck. A large, square-shaped label is affixed to the front, featuring a circular logo with "CADENHEAD'S SINGLE CASK" encircling a stylized "WC" monogram. Below this, text reads: "SINGLE MALT SCOTCH WHISKY", "DISTILLED AT ROYAL BRACKLA DISTILLERY", "AGED 38 YEARS", "70cl", "52.9%vol", and "BOTTLED BY WM CADENHEAD • CAMBELTOWN • SCOTLAND". The label is beige with black and gold typography. To the right of the bottle stands a matte black presentation box with an arched cutout window, allowing visibility of the bottle. The top of the box displays "CADENHEAD'S" in gold serif lettering, and the bottom reads "ESTD. 1842" in smaller gold text.

Thinking process:  
The editing instruction explicitly states a transformation of the whisky bottle into a **luxury home fragrance diffuser**, which involves changing the **function and form** of the object. Specific changes include:
- Replacing the **black screw cap** with an **elegant glass stopper**
- Adding **thin, dark diffuser reeds protruding from the top**
- Changing the **label design** to feature an **art deco style**, with **emerald green and gold color scheme**, and **floral/botanical illustrations**

These modifications indicate that the **bottle’s function**, **top closure**, **label content**, and **aesthetic branding** are all permitted to change. However, the **original physical structure** of the bottle (its shape, volume, material) is not specified for replacement—only its contents and surface elements are to be altered. The **presentation box** is not mentioned in the instructions, so its retention or modification is ambiguous.

Allowed Changes List:
- Bottle cap → replaced with glass stopper
- Top of bottle → addition of dark diffuser reeds
- Label → redesign with art deco style, emerald green and gold colors, floral/botanical motifs
- Function → changed from whisky bottle to fragrance diffuser
- Branding on label → altered to new aesthetic (no mention of retaining original text)
- Presentation box → not mentioned; assumed optional

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements must be preserved if they are essential to identifying the original object or scene. In this case, the **bottle's unique shape** and **material transparency** are critical to recognizing it as a premium spirits bottle. Although the label and cap are to be changed, the **glass body**, **liquid volume**, and **overall silhouette** are foundational to the object’s identity. If these were altered beyond recognition, the edited image would no longer represent the original product.

Functional/logical association elements: The **rectangular glass bottle** serves as the container—its **transparency**, **shape**, and **volume** (70cl) are tied to its original purpose. Even when repurposed as a diffuser, the **container's form** should remain consistent to maintain visual continuity. The **presence of liquid** (now possibly fragrance oil) is implied by the instruction to transform it into a diffuser, so the **filled state** of the bottle should be retained.

Non-modified element deduction: The **presentation box** is not mentioned in the editing instructions, but it is part of the original scene and supports the product’s luxury positioning. Since the instruction does not specify removing or altering it, and given that it contains brand-specific text ("CADENHEAD'S", "ESTD. 1842"), it may be considered a **contextual anchor**. However, because it is not directly involved in the transformation, it could be modified or removed unless explicitly required. But since it’s part of the original composition and contributes to brand identity, it should be **preserved unless stated otherwise**.

Preservation Targets List:
- The **rectangular glass bottle shape** with rounded edges
- The **transparent glass material** of the bottle
- The **amber-colored liquid inside** (volume and clarity)
- The **position and orientation** of the bottle relative to the box
- The **black presentation box** with arched window and gold text ("CADENHEAD'S", "ESTD. 1842")
- The **reflections and light interaction** on the glass surface (indicating real-world lighting)

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The **rectangular glass bottle with rounded edges** is the core structural identity of the product. Its shape distinguishes it from other bottles and is central to the Cadenhead’s packaging design. If this shape is altered (e.g., made round or tapered), the object would no longer be recognizable as the original bottle. This is a key identification feature and must be preserved.
    Question: Is the bottle’s main body still a transparent rectangular glass container with softly rounded edges?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The **amber-colored liquid** inside the bottle is a defining characteristic of the whisky. Even though the liquid may be replaced with fragrance oil in the edited version, the **presence of a golden-yellow translucent liquid filling the bottle** is essential to maintaining the visual consistency of a full product. Removing or replacing it with a different color or opacity would misrepresent the original.
    Question: Is the interior of the bottle filled with a golden-yellow translucent liquid?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The **black presentation box** with the arched window and gold lettering "CADENHEAD'S" and "ESTD. 1842" is a critical contextual element. It reinforces the brand identity and provides a frame for the product. While not part of the bottle itself, it is a key part of the original composition and helps establish the product’s premium status. Removing or altering it would disrupt the scene’s coherence.
    Question: Is the black box with the arched cutout and gold text "CADENHEAD'S" at the top and "ESTD. 1842" at the bottom still present?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The **light reflections and highlights** on the glass surface are important for conveying the material quality and realism of the bottle. These details confirm the bottle is made of glass and help distinguish it from plastic or other materials. Losing these reflections would make the bottle appear flat or synthetic, undermining its authenticity.
    Question: Are there visible reflections and highlights on the glass surface of the bottle indicating transparency and smoothness?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The **position of the bottle relative to the box**—specifically, the bottle placed to the left of the box with the box’s cutout aligned to display the bottle—is a compositional element that maintains visual balance and product presentation logic. Altering this spatial relationship would break the intended layout and reduce the image’s professional appearance.
    Question: Is the bottle positioned to the left of the box, with the box’s arched window aligned to frame the bottle?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The **base of the bottle** shows slight thickness and a flat bottom, which is typical for stable glass bottles. This detail supports the perception of a real, physical object. If the base were flattened or distorted, it might suggest digital manipulation or loss of fidelity. While minor, it contributes to the overall realism.
    Question: Does the bottle have a flat, thickened base that rests stably on the surface?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
