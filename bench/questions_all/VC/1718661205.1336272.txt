Description of reference image: The subject is a woman with light brown hair tied back in a loose braid, facing left in profile view, her gaze directed forward toward the horizon. She wears a light beige long-sleeve shirt and an olive-green tactical vest with visible straps and buckles, suggesting military or naval operational gear. Her hands are positioned on what appears to be a control panel or steering mechanism, indicating she is operating a vessel. In the background, a large gray naval warship—possibly an aircraft carrier—is visible on the open ocean under overcast skies. The water surface shows moderate waves, reflecting a dynamic maritime environment. The ship features a flat flight deck, radar arrays, and superstructure typical of modern naval vessels. The overall lighting is natural and diffused, consistent with cloudy weather at sea.

Thinking process:  
First, analyze the editing instructions word by word:  
- "Transform the military ship and ocean scene into a LEGO diorama" → This explicitly changes the **form** of both the ship and the ocean environment; thus, their physical appearance can be modified.  
- "Use gray and blue bricks for the ship body and waves" → Specifies material substitution but allows transformation of form.  
- "Construct the boat’s deck using small, detailed LEGO accessories" → Allows reconstruction of the deck's structure and texture.  
- "Replace the life vest and shirt with LEGO textures and shapes, retaining their colors" → Explicitly permits changing the **texture and shape** of clothing items but **requires retention of original colors** (olive green and beige).  
- "Position this LEGO model within a minimalist shelf display to highlight craftsmanship" → Changes the **setting**, placing the entire scene inside a display context, implying removal of real-world environmental elements.

From this, the following elements are allowed to change:
- The **physical form** of the ship (including its structure, scale, and materials).
- The **ocean surface**, including wave patterns and water texture.
- The **deck surface** and any equipment on it.
- The **texture and shape** of the clothing (vest and shirt), though color must remain unchanged.
- The **overall environment**, including sky, lighting, and spatial context, as it will be recontextualized into a shelf display.

Allowed Changes List:
- Shape and structure of the military ship
- Ocean surface and wave dynamics
- Deck details and equipment
- Texture and shape of the tactical vest and shirt
- Background environment (sky, water, distant horizon)
- Spatial setting (from open sea to shelf display)

Step 2 – Determine the elements that should remain unchanged

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements:  
- The **woman’s facial features** (especially her profile, eye shape, nose, and lips) are essential for identifying her as the central subject. These are not mentioned for modification and are not replaceable in identity terms.  
- The **hair color and style** (light brown, braided) are distinctive visual identifiers. While hairstyle may be altered slightly due to LEGO construction, the instruction does not allow changes to hair color or core styling, so it must be preserved.  
- The **color of the clothing**: The instruction specifically states “retaining their colors,” meaning the **beige shirt and olive-green vest must keep their original hues**, even if rendered in LEGO form. This is critical because color defines functional and aesthetic identity in military uniforms.  

Functional/logical association elements:  
- The **position of the hands on the control panel** indicates active operation of the vessel. This gesture is functionally significant—it implies the subject is piloting or navigating. Even in LEGO form, the hand placement relative to controls must be preserved to maintain logical coherence.  
- The **relative positioning of the subject to the ship in the background** is implied by the instruction to “transform” the scene, not relocate the subject. Thus, while the ship becomes LEGO, the subject remains in front of it, maintaining the narrative relationship.  

Non-modified element deduction:  
- Any unmentioned details such as **skin tone**, **eye color**, **ear shape**, and **facial expression** must be retained since they are not specified for change and are integral to identity.  
- The **presence of the tactical vest’s straps and buckles** must remain, even if rendered in LEGO, because they define the garment’s functional design. Their absence would alter the identification of the uniform type.  
- The **color contrast between the shirt and vest** is crucial for visual distinction and must be preserved per the instruction.

Preservation Targets List:
- Facial profile (side view, eye, nose, lip shape)
- Light brown braided hair
- Beige shirt color
- Olive-green tactical vest color
- Hand position on control panel
- Presence and structure of vest straps and buckles
- Skin tone and facial expression
- Eye color (blue-gray)
- Relative position of subject in front of ship

    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The woman’s profile is the primary identifier of the subject in the image. Her distinct facial features—specifically the shape of her nose, jawline, and eyes—are essential for recognition. If these features are distorted or replaced, the individual cannot be identified. Since the instruction does not mention altering her face, this is a core identity feature that must be preserved. The weight is 3 points because losing this would make the subject unrecognizable.
    Question: Is the woman’s facial profile, including the shape of her nose, jaw, and eyes, preserved in the edited image?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The light brown color and braided style of the hair are key visual identifiers. While the texture may be changed to LEGO-like, the instruction does not permit altering the hair color or basic styling. Changing either would misrepresent the subject’s appearance. This is a core recognition feature, especially given its prominence in the composition. Losing it would significantly affect identity.
    Question: Is the woman’s hair light brown in color and styled in a braid?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The instruction explicitly states that the shirt and vest colors must be retained. The beige shirt and olive-green vest are defining elements of her attire and suggest a specific role (military/naval). Changing their colors would violate the instruction and disrupt visual continuity. Even in LEGO form, the colors must match exactly. This is a high-weight requirement due to explicit directive.
    Question: Are the shirt and vest rendered in the original beige and olive-green colors, respectively?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The hand position on the control panel is a functional element indicating the subject is operating the vessel. It establishes the action and purpose of the scene. Even if the control panel becomes LEGO, the hand placement must remain consistent to preserve logical coherence. Altering this would break the narrative logic of the scene.
    Question: Are the woman’s hands positioned on a control mechanism in the same way as in the original image?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The presence of the tactical vest’s straps and buckles is critical for identifying the garment type. These structural details distinguish it from a simple jacket or vest. The instruction allows texture and shape change but not loss of functional components. Removing them would misrepresent the gear and undermine realism in the LEGO version.
    Question: Are the straps and buckles of the tactical vest visibly present and structurally intact?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The skin tone and facial expression contribute to the subject’s identity and emotional state. The original image shows a calm, focused expression with natural skin tone. These are not mentioned for change and are essential for preserving the character’s identity. Although subtle, they are part of the core visual signature.
    Question: Is the woman’s skin tone and facial expression (calm, focused) preserved?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The eye color (blue-gray) is a distinctive trait that contributes to facial recognition. While not always emphasized, it is a key detail in portrait consistency. Since no instruction mentions altering it, and it is clearly visible in the original, it must be preserved to maintain fidelity.
    Question: Does the woman have blue-gray eyes?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
