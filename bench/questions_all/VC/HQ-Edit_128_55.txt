**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a large, intricately carved wooden door set within a weathered adobe wall. The door features a pointed horseshoe arch typical of Moroccan or Moorish architecture, with elaborate geometric and arabesque carvings in relief across its surface. The door is composed of two panels joined by a central vertical stile, adorned with rows of black metal studs arranged in horizontal bands. A prominent golden spherical knocker is centered on the lower half of the door. Above the arch, a decorative lintel frame contains layered geometric patterns, including repeating motifs and interlacing designs. The surrounding stone and plaster frame exhibits signs of aging: peeling paint, cracks, and uneven textures. The wall material is earth-toned, with a rough, textured surface resembling rammed earth or mudbrick. To the right of the doorframe, a small square window with a blue mosaic tile insert adds a subtle contrast. The ground consists of rectangular paving stones laid in a herringbone pattern. The overall lighting is natural daylight, casting soft shadows that emphasize the depth of the carvings.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction explicitly transforms the ornate door into a **mystical guardian creature**, indicating that the **form and identity** of the door are to be reimagined. Key transformation directives include:
- *Extend geometric patterns into feathered wings*: This implies that the existing geometric designs (especially those on the door's surface) may be morphed into wing-like structures.
- *Morph knobs into shimmering eyes*: The metal studs (knobs) are to be transformed into eyes—suggesting their **position and arrangement** may be preserved but their **function and appearance** altered.
- *Evolve the arch into a celestial crown*: The upper arched shape is to become a crown, meaning the **shape and position** of the arch may be retained but repurposed.
- *Add etched runes across its wooden body*: New elements (runes) will be added, which are not present originally.
- *Integrate the doorframe into a regal, cloak-like structure*: The frame is to be reshaped into a cloak, implying a change in form and spatial relationship.

From this, we can deduce:
- The **door’s original form** (as a functional entrance) is no longer required.
- The **geometric patterns** and **studs** are allowed to be transformed into wings and eyes.
- The **arch** can be reinterpreted as a crown.
- The **doorframe** can be restructured into a cloak.
- However, **no instruction specifies altering the wall texture, window, ground, or lighting**—so these remain candidates for retention unless implied otherwise.

**Allowed Changes List:**
- Shape and function of the door (from static object to living creature)
- Position and visual interpretation of the metal studs (transformed into eyes)
- Interpretation of the arch (reimagined as a crown)
- Geometric patterns on the door (extended into wings)
- Doorframe (morphed into a cloak)
- Addition of runes (new element)
- Overall composition and symbolism (fantastical transformation)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
We now apply exclusion logic based on the allowed changes above:

**Core recognition elements:**  
Although the door is being transformed, certain **iconic visual traits** must remain identifiable to maintain continuity with the original image. These include:
- The **specific arrangement of geometric carvings** on the door panels — these are unique to Moroccan craftsmanship and define the aesthetic identity of the door.
- The **presence and placement of the golden spherical knocker** — it is a distinct focal point, both visually and symbolically.
- The **textured adobe wall** — while the door transforms, the surrounding environment anchors the scene and provides cultural context.
- The **small blue mosaic window** — a rare and distinctive feature, likely serving as a contextual anchor.
- The **paving stones on the ground** — they provide spatial grounding and scale.

These elements are **not mentioned in the instructions as being changed**, so they should be preserved unless the transformation inherently requires their removal (which it does not).

**Functional/logical association elements:**  
- The **door’s central vertical stile** — even if transformed into a creature, its role as a structural divider between panels may be preserved in form.
- The **horizontal bands of studs** — while morphed into eyes, their **spacing and alignment** may need to be retained for coherence.
- The **relationship between the door and the frame** — though the frame becomes a cloak, the **spatial containment** of the door within the architectural opening must remain consistent.

**Non-modified element deduction:**  
After excluding all elements listed as allowable for transformation, the remaining unmentioned visual components must be retained:
- Wall texture and color
- Window location and design
- Ground pattern
- Lighting direction and shadow quality
- The general orientation and scale of the scene

These are essential for maintaining **visual consistency** and **contextual authenticity**.

**Preservation Targets List:**
- The presence and position of the golden spherical knocker
- The specific geometric carving patterns on the door panels
- The texture and color of the surrounding adobe wall
- The small square window with blue mosaic tile
- The paved stone ground layout
- The horizontal bands of black metal studs (their positions and spacing)
- The overall architectural framing of the doorway (even if reinterpreted as a cloak)

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Visual Elements**

Q1:  
Thinking process: The golden spherical knocker is a key identifying feature of the original door, located centrally at the lower third of the door. Its reflective metallic sheen and spherical shape distinguish it from the surrounding wood and studs. It is not mentioned in the editing instruction to be removed or transformed, only that the door becomes a creature. Therefore, its presence and position must be preserved to maintain visual continuity. Loss of this element would significantly alter the door’s identity and make the transformation appear inconsistent with the source. Hence, it is a core visual anchor with a weight of 3 points.  
Question: Is the golden spherical knocker still present and positioned at the center of the lower half of the door?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The geometric carving patterns on the door panels are characteristic of Moroccan Islamic art, featuring interlocking stars, polygons, and arabesques. These patterns are integral to the door’s identity and are not mentioned as being erased or replaced. While the instruction allows extending them into wings, the original patterns must remain visible in the base form. Their loss would erase the cultural and artistic essence of the door. Thus, their presence is critical for identification and coherence.  
Question: Are the intricate geometric carvings visible on both door panels, especially in the upper and lower sections?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The black metal studs arranged in horizontal bands are a defining feature of traditional Moroccan doors. They serve both decorative and protective functions. The instruction states they are to be "morphed into shimmering eyes," which implies their **positions and alignment** must be preserved to allow for plausible transformation. If their spacing or number is altered, the eye transformation would appear unnatural. Thus, their **arrangement** must remain intact.  
Question: Are the horizontal rows of black metal studs evenly spaced and aligned across both door panels?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The surrounding adobe wall, with its cracked and weathered texture, provides crucial environmental context. It grounds the door in a real-world setting and contributes to the aged, historical feel. The instruction does not mention modifying the wall, so it must remain unchanged. Altering its texture or color would disrupt the scene’s authenticity and visual coherence.  
Question: Is the surrounding wall made of textured, earth-toned adobe with visible cracks and peeling plaster?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The small square window with blue mosaic tiles is a unique detail, located to the right of the doorframe. It adds visual interest and cultural specificity. Since it is not referenced in the editing instruction, it must be preserved. Its absence would create an imbalance in the composition and remove a key contextual clue.  
Question: Is there a small square window with a blue mosaic tile pattern located to the right of the doorframe?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The paved ground with rectangular stones in a herringbone pattern establishes scale and spatial context. It is part of the original scene and not mentioned for modification. Preserving it ensures the creature remains grounded in the same environment, maintaining realism. Its alteration could mislead viewers about the setting.  
Question: Is the ground composed of rectangular paving stones arranged in a herringbone pattern?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The architectural frame around the door, including the carved lintel and side jambs, defines the door’s placement and symmetry. Though the instruction says to integrate it into a cloak, the **original outline and proportions** must remain to ensure the transformation is coherent. If the frame’s shape is distorted, the creature’s integration would appear illogical.  
Question: Is the door framed by a carved wooden surround with geometric borders and a flat lintel above the arch?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2
