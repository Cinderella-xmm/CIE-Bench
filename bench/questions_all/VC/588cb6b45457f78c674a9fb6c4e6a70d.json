      "thinking_process": "The eyes are the most prominent feature in this portrait and serve as a primary identifier of Leonardo da Vinci. Their almond shape, upward tilt at the outer corners, and direct forward gaze are iconic and historically documented. Any alteration to their shape, position, or orientation would fundamentally change the subject's identity. This is a core recognition element, making it essential to preserve.",
      "question": "Are the eyes positioned symmetrically within the face, with a slight upward slant at the outer edges and gazing directly forward?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The nose is a defining anatomical feature in this portrait, characterized by a straight bridge and a refined tip. Its shape contributes significantly to the facial identity and has been consistently represented in known depictions of Leonardo. Changing its form would disrupt recognition.",
      "question": "Does the nose have a straight bridge and a slightly rounded tip, aligned centrally between the eyes?",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The mouth and lips are distinct in their thinness and closed, serene expression. The slight upward curve at the corners suggests contemplation, a hallmark of Leonardo’s portrayal. This detail is crucial for emotional authenticity and identity retention.",
      "question": "Are the lips thin, closed, and slightly upturned at the corners, forming a neutral yet thoughtful expression?",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The overall facial symmetry and proportion are central to the portrait’s balance and recognizability. Any distortion in width, height, or spacing between features would make the face unrecognizable as Leonardo’s. This includes the relative distance between the eyes, nose, and mouth.",
      "question": "Is the face proportionally balanced, with equal spacing between the eyes and symmetrical distribution of facial features?",

      "thinking_process": "The ear on the left side is partially visible beneath the hair and is a minor but identifiable anatomical detail. While not as prominent as the eyes or nose, its presence helps confirm the three-dimensionality and realism of the portrait. Removing or distorting it could affect coherence.",
      "question": "Is the left ear partially visible, emerging from under the hair near the temple?",

      "thinking_process": "The skin tone and shading around the face — particularly the soft transition from light to shadow on the cheeks and chin — are characteristic of the original painting technique. These details contribute to the lifelike quality and must be preserved even if stylized.",
      "question": "Are there soft shadows along the right side of the face and under the jawline, created by directional lighting from the left?",
