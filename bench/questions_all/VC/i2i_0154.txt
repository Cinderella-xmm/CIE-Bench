Description of reference image: The subject is a sleek black Ford Mustang GT parked on a brick driveway in front of a house with arched windows and red-tiled roofing. The car features iconic design elements like the Mustang logo on the grille, aggressive headlights, the "GT" badge on the side, and a sporty hood with vents. Its wheels have a black finish with a multi-spoke design. The background includes well-maintained green hedges and trees under a clear sky.

Thinking process: The instructions specify transforming the image to include front, side, and top views of the car, suggesting that the perspective and composition of the car can be modified. However, core design elements and specifics of the car, such as the Mustang logo, GT badge, and wheel design, must remain consistent across all views.

Allowed Changes List:
Specific element 1 that allows for changes - The camera angles and perspective of the car can be changed to include front, side, and top views.
(Specific element 2 that allows for changes - The surrounding environment and background can be changed or removed to emphasize the vehicle.)

Thinking process:
Core recognition elements like the Mustang logo, GT badge, and the overall car shape must remain consistent because they define the car's identity. Functional/logical association elements, such as the placement of wheels and lights, must be accurate to maintain the car's structural integrity across different views. Non-modified elements, including the color scheme and specific details like exhaust outlets and side mirrors, contribute to the car's visual coherence and should also be retained unless specified otherwise.

Preservation Targets List:
(Mustang logo on the grille)
(GT badge on the side)
(Black multi-spoke wheel design)
(Car's color and overall shape)
(Lights and exhaust outlets)
