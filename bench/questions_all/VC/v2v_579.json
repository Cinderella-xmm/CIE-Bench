      "thinking_process": "The central green block is the focal point of the image, defined by its unique color and central location. Its position is critical to the image’s narrative and visual balance. Even after transformation into a chibi character, the character must occupy the same central position to preserve the original composition’s intent. This spatial relationship is a core identity feature — losing it would fundamentally alter the image’s message and structure. Therefore, the question directly targets the preservation of this key positional element, which is essential for maintaining consistency with the original.",

      "thinking_process": "The stud pattern on the top of each block is a defining visual feature of LEGO bricks. It is the primary identifier that distinguishes these objects from generic cubes or other toys. Even if the blocks are stylized into cartoon characters, the presence of the stud pattern — whether as a simplified design or integrated into the character’s body — must be retained to preserve the object’s identity. Without it, the characters lose their connection to the original building blocks, breaking the visual continuity.",

      "thinking_process": "The rectangular prism shape is fundamental to the identity of LEGO bricks. While the instruction allows for transformation into chibi characters, the base geometry must remain recognizable. A chibi character derived from a block should still have a boxy, cubic form consistent with the original block’s silhouette. If the shape becomes rounded or organic, it no longer represents a block, undermining the transformation’s coherence.",

      "thinking_process": "The pile-like arrangement of blocks filling the frame creates a sense of abundance and context. This dense, overlapping layout is a key environmental detail that defines the scene. Even if the background is changed, the foreground must still show a cluster of characters (originally blocks) densely packed together, maintaining the impression of a heap. This spatial density is important for visual coherence and continuity.",

      "thinking_process": "The original image features a single block of different color (green) among many red ones. This contrast is central to the image’s meaning. Even after transformation, the derived character from the green block must remain visually distinct in color or design from the others to preserve the “odd one out” theme. If all characters become uniformly colored or styled, the original contrast is lost.",

While not visible in the original image due to the angle, the presence of these features is implied by the nature of the objects. In a faithful edit, even if stylized, the characters should retain some indication of connectivity — such as small indentations or mechanical joints — to reflect the original function. This is a minor but meaningful detail that supports the authenticity of the transformation.",
