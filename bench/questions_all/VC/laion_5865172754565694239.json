      "thinking_process": "The \"DUCATI\" logo on the down tube is the most prominent branding element and core identifier of the product. If this text is removed or altered beyond recognition, the bike can no longer be identified as a Ducati, undermining the entire brand identity. Its white color and diagonal placement along the red frame are distinctive. Thus, preserving this exact text and position is essential for recognition.",
      "question": "Is the \"DUCATI\" text in white lettering clearly visible along the down tube of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The \"DUCATI\" logo on the seat stay is a secondary but important branding element that reinforces the brand identity. Though smaller, it is consistently placed in the original design and helps confirm authenticity. Removing or distorting it would reduce brand recognition.",
      "question": "Is the \"DUCATI\" text in white lettering visible on the seat stay?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The \"SPORT\" text on the top tube near the head tube identifies the specific model line. This is a key functional descriptor for the bike’s classification. Its absence would make the model ambiguous and reduce the accuracy of the product representation.",
      "question": "Is the word \"SPORT\" in white lettering present on the top tube near the head tube?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The \"TECH\" label below the bottom bracket is a minor but intentional branding detail that indicates technological features. While less prominent, it contributes to the full product identity. Its removal would represent a loss of detail that could affect authenticity.",
      "question": "Is the word \"TECH\" in white lettering visible below the bottom bracket?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The red color of the frame is iconic to Ducati and essential for brand recognition. Even though the instruction suggests turning it into a \"hero suit,\" the underlying red color must remain as the base tone to preserve identity. Any significant deviation (e.g., changing to blue or gray) would misrepresent the product.",
      "question": "Is the main frame of the bicycle predominantly red in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "thinking_process": "The black saddle and handlebars are standard components that contrast with the red frame and are part of the bike’s design language. Their presence and color are important for visual balance and component identification. Changing them to other colors or removing them would alter the bike’s appearance significantly.",
      "question": "Are the saddle and handlebars black in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The chain and drivetrain layout (crankset, chain, rear derailleur, cassette) must remain structurally coherent to reflect the bike’s functionality. Even in an animated version, the chain must connect the front and rear sprockets properly. Disrupting this would break the mechanical logic of the bike.",
      "question": "Is the chain visibly connecting the front crankset to the rear cassette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q8",
      "thinking_process": "The tire design, specifically the black rubber with a silver reflective stripe, is a distinctive aesthetic feature that contributes to the modern look of the bike. This detail is not universal across bicycles and thus helps identify this particular model. Altering or omitting the stripe would reduce visual fidelity.",
      "question": "Do both tires have a silver reflective stripe along the sidewall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q9",
      "thinking_process": "The wheel hubs are the attachment points for the spokes and are critical mechanical components. Even if limbs emerge from them, the hubs themselves must still be visually present and correctly positioned at the center of each wheel to maintain structural logic.",
      "question": "Are the wheel hubs clearly visible at the center of both front and rear wheels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q10",
      "thinking_process": "The diamond-shaped frame geometry (top tube, down tube, seat tube, chainstays, seat stays) defines the structural integrity and typical road bike form. Altering this shape would make the bike unrecognizable as a conventional bicycle. Preservation ensures the object remains a plausible bike, even when animated.",
      "question": "Does the frame maintain a diamond-shaped structure with connected top, down, seat, and chain stays?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
