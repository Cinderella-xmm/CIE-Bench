**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

Description of reference image:  
The subject is a log cabin constructed from horizontally stacked, rounded wooden logs with visible chinking between them. The structure features a steeply pitched gable roof covered in dark gray shingles. On the front façade, there are two large brown garage doors at ground level, flanked by concrete foundation walls. Above the garage doors, a large open-framed window section reveals an unfinished interior with exposed wooden beams and trusses. To the left side of the building, a small rectangular window is cut into the log wall, and adjacent to it, a partially open doorway reveals a glimpse of the interior. The surrounding environment consists of a flat, gravel-covered ground with sparse vegetation, distant hills, and a pale sky. A blue construction vehicle is partially visible on the far left edge of the frame.

Thinking process:  
The editing instructions explicitly transform the log cabin into an "enchanted woodland guardian," indicating that the **form, material appearance, and function** of the structure are to be radically altered. Specific changes include:
- Walls becoming **bark-covered limbs** → allows change to texture and form of walls
- Windows morphing into **glowing amber eyes** → allows change to window shape, color, and luminosity
- Roof shifting into a **leafy canopy extending upward** → allows change to roof material, shape, and extension
- Vines and moss creeping over the structure → allows addition of organic overgrowth
- Mystical rune carvings along logs → allows addition of symbolic patterns
- Doors replaced with **animated forest spirit faces exuding emerald energy trails** → allows complete replacement of door elements

These transformations imply that **all structural components** (walls, roof, windows, doors) are permitted to change in form, texture, and function. The **scene environment**, including background hills, sky, gravel ground, and construction vehicle, is not mentioned for retention, so it is within the scope of possible modification.

Allowed Changes List:  
- Wall material and form (from logs to bark-covered limbs)  
- Window design and luminosity (from glass openings to glowing amber eyes)  
- Roof material and shape (from shingled gable to leafy canopy extending upward)  
- Door elements (from garage doors to animated forest spirit faces)  
- Addition of vines, moss, runes, and energy trails  
- Environmental elements (ground, sky, hills, vehicle) — may be altered or removed

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

Thinking process:  
Despite extensive transformation, certain visual elements must remain intact to preserve **identity continuity** and **logical coherence** with the original image, even if they are not central to the fantasy theme. These are derived through exclusion from the allowed changes:

1. **Core recognition elements**: While the cabin's form is to be transformed, the **original spatial layout**—specifically the **two garage doors positioned side-by-side on the lower half of the front façade**—is a defining architectural feature. Even if replaced by spirit faces, their **position, number, and alignment** must remain consistent to maintain structural logic. Similarly, the **large upper window section** above the garage doors is a key architectural element; its **location and framing** must be preserved as a spatial anchor.

2. **Functional/logical association elements**: The **foundation base** of the cabin (the concrete slab beneath the logs) is a functional support structure. It is not mentioned for transformation and is visually distinct from the wooden logs. Its presence grounds the structure and maintains physical plausibility. If removed or altered without reason, it would undermine the structural integrity implied in the original.

3. **Non-modified element deduction**: The **small rectangular window on the left side** and the **doorway adjacent to it** are not referenced in the instructions. Since they are not specified for change, and their removal would distort the original layout, they must be retained in position and form. Additionally, the **overall orientation and angle** of the cabin (facing slightly toward the right) should remain unchanged to preserve spatial context.

Preservation Targets List:  
- Position and alignment of the two garage doors on the front façade  
- Location and framing of the large upper window section above the garage doors  
- Presence and placement of the small rectangular window on the left side  
- Presence and location of the adjacent doorway next to the small window  
- Concrete foundation base beneath the log walls  
- Overall orientation and perspective of the cabin (slightly angled toward the right)

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

Q1:  
Thinking process: The two garage doors are core architectural features of the cabin’s front façade. Their side-by-side alignment and position below the upper window section define the building’s functional symmetry. Changing their location or eliminating them entirely would alter the fundamental structure. Thus, their **presence and alignment** are essential for maintaining identity, making this a weight-3 element.  
Question: Are the two garage doors positioned side by side on the lower front portion of the cabin, directly beneath the large upper window section?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The large upper window section with exposed wooden framing is a distinctive feature that defines the cabin’s aesthetic and structural openness. It is located above the garage doors and spans nearly the full width of the front. Its **shape and position** are critical for identifying the original structure. Removing or relocating it would break the architectural coherence. This is a key visual identifier, hence weight-3.  
Question: Is there a large, multi-pane window section with exposed wooden beams located directly above the two garage doors, spanning most of the front width of the cabin?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The small rectangular window on the left side is a minor but identifiable detail. Its presence contributes to the asymmetry of the façade and helps distinguish this specific cabin from others. Since it is not mentioned in the editing instructions, it must remain in place to preserve fidelity to the original layout. This is a secondary but necessary detail, hence weight-2.  
Question: Is there a small rectangular window cut into the log wall on the left side of the cabin, near the front corner?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The doorway adjacent to the small window is a functional entrance. Though not prominent, it provides logical access and completes the left-side composition. Its **position relative to the window** is fixed in the original and must be preserved to maintain spatial accuracy. This is a logical consistency element, thus weight-2.  
Question: Is there a doorway located immediately to the right of the small rectangular window on the left side of the cabin?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The concrete foundation base is a non-wooden, visually distinct element that supports the log structure. It is present beneath all sides of the cabin and is crucial for grounding the building. Since it is not mentioned for transformation, its **presence and placement** must be retained to preserve structural realism. This is a foundational detail, hence weight-2.  
Question: Is there a continuous concrete foundation base running beneath the log walls of the cabin, visible along the lower perimeter?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The overall orientation of the cabin—facing slightly to the right—is a key spatial cue. It affects how the viewer perceives depth and proportion. Altering this angle would make the scene appear disoriented or inconsistent with the original. This is a perspective-based detail that supports visual coherence, thus weight-1.  
Question: Is the cabin oriented such that its front façade is angled slightly toward the right side of the image, with the left side receding into the background?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1
