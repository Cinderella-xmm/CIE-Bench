Description of reference image: The subject is a man with short dark hair, wearing black-rimmed glasses and a blue long-sleeve sweater. He is seated at a wooden table, facing slightly to the left of the frame, with his head turned toward the camera. His facial expression shows exaggerated surprise or effort as he blows air from his mouth. In his right hand, he holds a small black handheld fan, which is angled toward a white frosted birthday cake placed on a white plate in front of him. The cake has seven lit candles—colored yellow, pink, blue, and white—arranged in a row, with visible smoke rising from them, indicating they have just been blown out. The background is a plain, neutral beige wall with no distinct features. The lighting is soft and even, highlighting the subject’s face and the cake. The composition centers on the interaction between the man, the fan, and the cake.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions that explicitly transform the form of the original subject and scene. The instruction states to "design a digital character card styled as an RPG collectible," which implies a complete transformation of the visual style into a 3D cartoon aesthetic. This includes changing the rendering style, proportions, and overall presentation. The instruction specifies replacing the real-world setting with a festive-themed backdrop featuring balloons and candles, meaning the original background (neutral beige wall) and table are not required to be preserved. The subject's appearance will be stylized into a cartoon version, so physical details like skin texture, clothing fabric, and realistic facial features can be altered. However, the core action—using a handheld fan to blow out candles—is central to the narrative and must be retained in function, even if stylized. The presence of the fan and cake with candles is essential for maintaining the humorous logic of the scene. Elements such as the number of candles, their colors, and the act of blowing are implied to be preserved in concept, though not necessarily in exact form. The instruction allows full creative freedom over style, color palette, and layout, but does not mention altering the symbolic relationship between the fan and the candles.

Allowed Changes List:
- The subject’s appearance (facial features, hairstyle, clothing texture) can be changed to a 3D cartoon style
- The background (beige wall and wooden table) can be replaced with a festive-themed backdrop
- Lighting and color tone can be adjusted to match a warm, cheerful vibe
- The overall composition and framing can be modified to fit a collectible card format
- The cake and candles can be stylized in shape and design, as long as their symbolic role is maintained
- The fan can be redesigned in form and material, as long as it remains a handheld device used for blowing

Thinking process:
Core recognition elements: The original image contains several key visual identifiers that define the scene’s identity and humor. The most critical is the **handheld fan**—a black, circular, portable electric fan with visible blades and a handle, held in the man’s right hand. Its presence and use are central to the joke of “blowing out” candles without using breath. The **seven lit candles** on the cake, each with a distinct color (yellow, pink, blue, white), are also essential—they represent the birthday context and the target of the action. The **smoke rising from the candles** indicates they were recently extinguished, reinforcing the timing and cause-effect logic. These elements are not merely decorative; they are functional components of the scene’s narrative. Changing them would break the intended humor and logic.

Functional/logical association elements: The **interaction between the fan and the candles** is crucial. The fan is positioned to direct airflow toward the candles, and the smoke confirms its effect. This causal relationship must be preserved—even if stylized—as it defines the character’s “resourceful problem-solving.” If the fan is removed or repositioned away from the candles, the joke fails. Similarly, the **cake’s position on the plate** and its proximity to the man ensure the scene’s spatial logic remains intact.

Non-modified element deduction: After excluding allowed changes (style, background, lighting, etc.), the remaining elements that must be retained are those directly tied to the core action and identity. These include the **presence of the fan**, the **number and arrangement of candles**, the **smoke**, and the **man’s posture** (leaning forward, blowing). While the man’s face and clothing can be stylized, the **act of blowing** and the **fan’s orientation** must remain consistent to preserve the narrative. The **white frosting texture** of the cake is a minor detail but contributes to realism and should be retained unless explicitly altered by the style change.

Preservation Targets List:
- The presence of a handheld fan in the man’s right hand
- The presence of seven candles on the cake, with visible flames and smoke
- The smoke rising from the candles, indicating they were just extinguished
- The man’s posture of leaning forward and blowing air
- The cake’s placement on a white plate on a wooden surface (as a base reference point)
- The relative positioning of the fan directed toward the candles

Q1:  
Thinking process: The handheld fan is the central prop that enables the humorous twist of using technology instead of breath to blow out candles. Its presence and function are essential to the scene’s identity. The key identifying feature is the **circular black fan with visible blades and a handle**, held in the right hand. This specific object is not just a tool but a symbol of resourcefulness. If this fan is replaced with another object (e.g., a leaf, a paper fan), the core joke is lost. Therefore, the fan’s **form and function** must be preserved, even if stylized. The question focuses on whether the fan is still present and used in the same way, which is a core identity element.

Question: Is there a handheld fan with a circular blade structure being held in the man’s right hand, directed toward the cake?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The candles are the target of the action and represent the birthday celebration. Their **number (seven)** and **color pattern (yellow, pink, blue, white)** are visually distinctive and contribute to the scene’s specificity. The **flames and smoke** indicate they were just extinguished, which is critical to the narrative. Even if stylized, the candles must retain their **vertical alignment** and **function as the source of smoke**. Losing this would break the logical sequence of events.

Question: Are there exactly seven candles on the cake, with visible flames and smoke rising from them?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The smoke rising from the candles is a key indicator that the candles were just blown out. It provides visual proof of the action’s success and ties the fan’s use to the result. Without smoke, the scene loses its dynamic and causal logic. The **presence of wispy white smoke** above the candles is a non-negotiable detail that confirms the moment captured in the image.

Question: Is there visible smoke rising from the candles on the cake?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The man’s posture—leaning forward with lips puckered in a blowing motion—is essential to conveying the intent behind the action. This **facial expression and body language** establish the comedic effort involved. Even in a cartoon style, the **direction of the gaze and the open mouth** must remain consistent to preserve the narrative. This is a functional element that supports the logic of the scene.

Question: Is the man leaning forward with his mouth puckered as if blowing air toward the cake?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The cake is placed on a white plate, which rests on a wooden surface. This **spatial arrangement** grounds the scene and provides a stable reference point. While the table and plate may be stylized, their **relative positions** must be preserved to maintain the scene’s coherence. The cake’s **white frosting texture** is a minor detail but contributes to its recognizability as a birthday cake.

Question: Is the cake placed on a white plate, which is on a wooden surface?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The **relative positioning of the fan and the candles** is critical to the joke. The fan must be aimed at the candles to suggest it caused the extinguishing. If the fan is moved away or pointed elsewhere, the causal link is broken. This spatial relationship is a functional element that must be preserved.

Question: Is the handheld fan positioned so that its airflow is directed toward the candles on the cake?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2
