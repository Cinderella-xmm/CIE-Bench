Description of reference image: The subject is a retail package of four AA Duracell Coppertop alkaline batteries. The packaging features a black background with bold white and gold typography. At the top left, "AA | 4" is displayed in yellow text, indicating the battery size and count. The brand name "DURACELL" is prominently displayed in large white capital letters, with "COPPERTOP" beneath it in smaller, golden-yellow font. Below this, a silver banner reads "DURALOCK POWER PRESERVE™" with a circular icon depicting a copper-colored lock symbol. To the right, an orange oval badge states "GUARANTEED for 10 YEARS in storage" in English and "GARANTIES pour 10 ANS lorsqu'elles sont entreposées" in French. Four cylindrical batteries are aligned horizontally at the bottom center; each has a copper-colored top and a black body with "DURACELL" printed vertically in white. A thin silver band around the base of each battery displays "DURALOCK." The lower-right corner includes "4 Alkaline Batteries / piles alcalines" in small text. Behind the batteries, a dynamic curved gradient of yellow and orange light emanates from behind them, creating a sense of energy. The overall design emphasizes durability, power, and long-term reliability.

Thinking process:  
First, analyze the editing instructions:  
- Transform the battery pack into a sci-fi comic cover → implies complete reimagining of scene and presentation style.  
- Anthropomorphize the batteries as robot heroes → changes form and function of the batteries but retains their core identity (copper tops, black bodies).  
- Style: Bold and metallic with sleek techno lines → allows for stylistic reinterpretation of visual elements.  
- Title: "Duracell Guardians: Power Preserve Adventures!" → new title, not tied to original branding visuals.  
- Setting: Digital cityscape with orange holographic skies → replaces original background entirely.  
- Highlight “10 Years in Storage” as a key plot element on an embedded digital screen → requires retention of this textual information, but in transformed format (e.g., digital display).

Allowed Changes List:  
- Background environment (original black card with gradient replaced by digital cityscape)  
- Overall composition and layout (packaging structure removed, replaced by comic-style framing)  
- Battery shape and posture (anthropomorphized into robot figures)  
- Color palette (adjusted for sci-fi aesthetic, though copper/black may remain dominant)  
- Text content (new title, new narrative context)  
- Visual style (shift from product packaging to comic book art)  
- Positioning of batteries (no longer fixed in row; now dynamic characters)  

Step 2 - Determine the elements that should remain unchanged  
Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements:  
- The copper-colored top of the batteries is a signature feature of Duracell Coppertop line, distinguishing it from other brands. It is iconic and must be preserved in any transformation to maintain brand identity.  
- The black body with vertical "DURACELL" text is another core identifier — even if stylized, the presence and placement of the brand name must be retained to ensure recognition.  
- The "DURALOCK" band near the base of each battery is a trademarked feature and part of the product’s identity; its presence must be maintained, even if stylized.  
- The "10 Years in Storage" guarantee is explicitly called out in the instruction as a key plot element — thus, while its format may change (e.g., digital screen), the message itself must be preserved.  

Functional/logical association elements:  
- The relationship between the batteries and the "DURALOCK POWER PRESERVE" technology is central to the product's value proposition. Even when anthropomorphized, the concept of power preservation must be visually linked to the characters (e.g., via armor or device labeled DURALOCK).  
- The number "4" indicating quantity must be preserved, as it reflects the product count — even if abstracted, there must be four hero figures.  

Non-modified element deduction:  
After excluding allowed changes (background, layout, style, posture), the following remain:  
- Copper color of the battery tops  
- Black body with white "DURACELL" lettering  
- Silver "DURALOCK" band  
- "10 Years in Storage" claim  
- Brand name "DURACELL" in prominent position  
- Number "4" representing quantity  

Preservation Targets List:  
- Copper-colored top of each battery  
- Black body with vertical "DURACELL" text  
- Silver "DURALOCK" band near base  
- "10 Years in Storage" textual guarantee  
- Presence of four batteries/characters  
- Brand name "DURACELL" in visible form

    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The copper-colored top is the defining visual trait of Duracell Coppertop batteries, used globally to distinguish them from other alkaline brands. Its absence would make the batteries unrecognizable as Duracell products. This feature is critical for brand identity and consumer recognition, hence a weight of 3 points.
    Question: Are the battery tops rendered in copper color?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The black body with the vertical "DURACELL" text in white is a core branding element across all Duracell Coppertop packaging. Changing this would fundamentally alter the product’s visual identity. Even in a stylized form, the presence of this text and color scheme must be preserved for recognition. Thus, it is assigned 3 points.
    Question: Is the word "DURACELL" printed vertically in white on the black body of each battery?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The "DURALOCK" band is a registered trademark and a key functional claim associated with the product’s longevity. While the instruction allows stylization, the presence of this label must be preserved to maintain logical continuity with the original product. Removing it would misrepresent the product’s features. Therefore, it is a 2-point element.
    Question: Is there a silver band near the base of each battery with the word "DURALOCK" inscribed on it?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The "10 Years in Storage" guarantee is explicitly highlighted in the instruction as a key plot element. Though its presentation may change (e.g., digital screen), the actual phrase must appear in some form to fulfill the narrative requirement. Losing this text would break the intended story link. Hence, it is a 3-point element.
    Question: Is the phrase "10 Years in Storage" visibly present in the edited image?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The original package contains four batteries, which is a core product attribute. The instruction specifies transforming them into a team of four robot heroes, so the count must remain exactly four. Any deviation would misrepresent the product quantity and undermine consistency. Thus, this is a 2-point element.
    Question: Are there exactly four batteries or battery-inspired characters depicted?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The brand name "DURACELL" appears prominently at the top of the original packaging and is essential for brand recognition. Even in a comic-style transformation, the name must be clearly visible to maintain authenticity. Its absence would render the image unidentifiable as a Duracell product. This is a 3-point element.
    Question: Is the brand name "DURACELL" displayed in large, bold letters at the top of the image?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
