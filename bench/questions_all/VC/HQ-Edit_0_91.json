Its presence and position are critical to the visual balance and cultural symbolism of the robe. If removed or relocated, the robe loses its distinctiveness and becomes unrecognizable as the original garment. This is a core identity element tied to the subject's attire, making it a 3-point weight question.",
      "question": "Is the circular golden medallion located at the center of the floral panel on the chest still present and positioned in the same place?",

      "thinking_process": "The floral embroidery on the sleeves and shoulders features a complex arrangement of multicolored flowers (red, blue, yellow, white) with detailed petals and stems. This pattern is integral to the robe’s identity and distinguishes it from other garments. Even if gold leaf is added, the underlying pattern must remain identifiable. Altering or omitting these motifs would compromise the authenticity of the textile. Thus, this is a 3-point weight element.",
      "question": "Are the multicolored floral patterns (including red, blue, yellow, and white flowers) visible on the sleeves and shoulders of the robe, maintaining their original positions and compositions?",

In a semi-cartoon style, the hair might be simplified, but its side-parted direction and fullness must be preserved to maintain recognition. Losing this feature would alter the subject’s identity. Therefore, it is a 3-point weight element.",
      "question": "Is the white hair parted on the left side and swept back neatly from the forehead, forming a clear division down the middle of the head?",

Although the instruction allows enlargement, the **relative positioning and interlocking of fingers** must remain consistent. Changing this would disrupt the logical posture. This is an important functional element affecting scene coherence, so it receives a 2-point weight.",

It defines the garment’s structure and cultural identity. Any deviation in trim color or shape would make the robe unrecognizable. Since the instruction does not mention changing the collar design, it must be preserved. This is a key accessory detail, so it gets a 2-point weight.",

While the style may become cartoonish, the **proportional width and fullness of the sleeves** must remain consistent to preserve the garment’s silhouette. Narrowing or shortening them would distort the cultural representation. This is a secondary but important structural detail, hence a 1-point weight.",

While the instruction allows framing and floral extensions, the **original background texture and color** beneath the figure must remain visible where not overlaid. This provides context and aesthetic continuity. It is a minor environmental detail but contributes to visual coherence. Thus, it is a 1-point weight.",
