Description of reference image: The subject is a male dancer captured mid-movement in a dynamic ballet pose, positioned diagonally across the frame. He is wearing a black sleeveless leotard that fits closely to his body, emphasizing his muscular definition and form. His right leg is extended high into the air, bent at the knee with the foot pointed, while his left leg supports his weight, slightly bent at the knee and grounded. His right arm is raised vertically above his head, fully extended, while his left arm extends outward to the side, fingers gently splayed in a graceful line. His head is turned slightly to the left, facing forward with a focused expression, and his short dark hair is neatly styled. The background is a neutral, smooth gray gradient with no distinct features or textures, creating a minimalist studio environment. The lighting is soft and directional, casting subtle shadows that accentuate the contours of his muscles and limbs. The floor is a flat, dark surface, barely visible at the bottom edge of the frame. The overall composition is monochromatic, with high contrast between the dancer’s silhouette and the background, highlighting the elegance and precision of the movement.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions to determine what can be changed. The instruction explicitly states to "design a 3D chibi-style rendition" of the dancer, which means the form, proportions, and style of the subject are allowed to change significantly—specifically, the character will be stylized into a chibi (super-deformed) version with exaggerated features and simplified anatomy. The instruction also specifies a new scene: a glowing elliptical portal framed by blue and purple hues, leading to a stylized 3D chibi world with grayscale aesthetics and spotlight effects. This indicates that the original background and setting are to be replaced entirely. However, the instruction does not mention altering the dancer’s core identity or specific physical characteristics such as gender, posture, or gesture. It does require retaining the dancer’s pose and extending their hand toward the viewer, which implies that the fundamental action and orientation must remain consistent. Therefore, elements like the dancer’s gender, the direction of the gaze, the extension of the arms and legs, and the overall dynamic balance of the pose are not explicitly permitted to change, even if the style is altered. Additionally, the instruction mentions “frozen mid-pose,” suggesting that the moment of motion should be preserved in essence, though not necessarily in realism.

Allowed Changes List:
- The dancer’s form and proportions (due to chibi transformation)
- Clothing style and texture (as it will be reimagined in 3D chibi style)
- Background and environment (replaced with a portal and chibi world)
- Color scheme (original is black and white; new version includes blue, purple, and grayscale with spotlights)
- Artistic style (from realistic monochrome photography to 3D chibi animation)
- Lighting and shadowing (to match the new stylized world)
- Facial features (can be simplified or cartoonified in chibi style)

Step 2 - Determine the elements that should remain unchanged

Thinking process:
Core recognition elements: The dancer’s identity is defined by several key visual traits: male gender, short dark hair, black sleeveless leotard, and the specific ballet pose involving one leg extended high and the other supporting, with arms in an asymmetrical, expressive configuration. These are essential for recognizing the subject as the same individual from the original image. Even in a chibi style, the gender and basic pose must be preserved to maintain identity continuity. The instruction specifies “the dancer depicted in the image,” so the subject’s core identity must remain intact despite stylistic changes.

Functional/logical association elements: The dancer’s pose is functional—it represents a specific ballet movement. The instruction says “frozen mid-pose,” meaning the dynamic balance and spatial relationship of limbs must be preserved. The extension of the hand toward the viewer is explicitly mentioned, indicating that this gesture must be retained for narrative and compositional purposes. If the hand were not extended or faced away, the invitation implied by the instruction would be lost, breaking the logical flow of the scene.

Non modified element deduction: After excluding the allowed changes (style, clothing details, background, color), the remaining unmentioned but visually present elements include the dancer’s gender, the direction of the gaze, the relative positioning of limbs, and the overall silhouette of the pose. These are not explicitly stated as changeable, and since they define the subject’s identity and action, they must be preserved. For example, the fact that the right leg is raised and the left supports the body is a structural feature of the pose that cannot be reversed without changing the meaning of the movement.

Preservation Targets List:
- The dancer’s gender (male)
- The dancer’s short dark hair
- The dancer’s black sleeveless leotard (as a defining garment)
- The specific ballet pose: right leg extended upward, left leg supporting, right arm raised, left arm extended sideways
- The direction of the gaze (slightly to the left, facing forward)
- The extension of the left hand toward the viewer (inviting gesture)
- The diagonal orientation of the body across the frame

Q1:  
Thinking process: The presence of short dark hair is a core identification feature of the dancer in the original image. While the chibi style may simplify the hairstyle, the fact that the dancer has short dark hair is a distinguishing trait that helps identify him as the same individual. Losing this feature could lead to misidentification, especially if the hair were made long or light-colored. Therefore, it is a key visual element that must be retained, even if stylized. This is a 2-point element because it is important for identity but not as critical as the pose itself.
Question: Is the dancer depicted with short dark hair?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The black sleeveless leotard is a defining piece of attire that contributes to the dancer’s identity and professional appearance. Although the material and texture may be altered in the chibi version, the garment’s shape and color must remain consistent to preserve the subject’s recognizable outfit. Changing it to a different color or style (e.g., shorts or tunic) would alter the dancer’s identity and break visual continuity. This is a 2-point element because it is a key accessory tied to the subject’s role and appearance.

Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The specific ballet pose—right leg extended high, left leg supporting, right arm raised, left arm extended—is the central action of the image. The instruction emphasizes “frozen mid-pose” and requires the dancer to be in a dynamic form, so the spatial arrangement of limbs must be preserved. Reversing the leg positions or changing the arm angles would fundamentally alter the movement and make it unrecognizable as the same pose. This is a 3-point element because it is the core identity of the action and essential for maintaining the integrity of the original moment.
Question: Is the dancer’s right leg extended upward while the left leg supports the body?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The direction of the gaze is a subtle but important detail that conveys focus and expression. In the original image, the dancer looks slightly to the left with a forward-facing profile. This orientation is part of the emotional and compositional balance of the pose. If the gaze were shifted dramatically or turned away, it would disrupt the sense of engagement and intention. Since the instruction mentions the dancer extending a hand toward the viewer, the facial orientation must align with that gesture. This is a 2-point element because it supports the narrative logic and maintains consistency in expression.
Question: Is the dancer’s head turned slightly to the left, facing forward?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The extension of the left hand toward the viewer is explicitly required by the instruction (“illustrate the dancer extending their hand toward the viewer”). This gesture is not only a compositional choice but also a functional element that creates interaction with the audience. In the original image, the left arm is extended outward, and the hand is open with fingers splayed. This must be preserved in the chibi version to fulfill the narrative intent. Any deviation, such as a closed fist or backward extension, would violate the instruction and break the welcoming gesture. This is a 3-point element because it is directly tied to the purpose of the edited image and is a key functional component.
Question: Is the dancer’s left hand extended forward toward the viewer with fingers splayed?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The diagonal orientation of the body across the frame is a compositional feature that defines the dynamic energy of the pose. The dancer’s body forms a strong diagonal line from the lower left to the upper right, which is crucial for conveying motion and balance. Even in a chibi style, this spatial arrangement must be maintained to preserve the sense of movement and visual rhythm. Altering this alignment would distort the pose and make it appear static or unnatural. This is a 2-point element because it is essential for the overall structure of the image and affects how the pose is perceived.
