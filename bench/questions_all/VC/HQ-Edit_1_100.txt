**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a young woman seated at a wooden desk in a dimly lit library, reading an open book. She has dark hair styled in a neat bun with loose strands framing her face. She wears round wire-rimmed glasses and a high-collared, two-toned garment: the body is a textured gray-blue vest with five visible dark brown buttons running vertically down the front, and the sleeves are cream-colored, slightly puffed at the shoulders with ribbed cuffs. Her posture is forward-leaning, focused on the book, with her right hand resting gently on its pages. The lighting comes from a green-shaded desk lamp to her right, casting warm illumination on the book and her hands. Behind her, tall wooden bookshelves extend into the background, filled with aged books. A narrow vertical window with a grid pattern allows soft daylight to enter from the left side, contributing to the ambient light. The table holds several stacked vintage books, one open in front of her and another open further down the desk. The overall atmosphere is quiet, scholarly, and rich in texture—wood grain, fabric weave, and paper aging.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction specifies transformation into an **art calendar page**, with stylistic changes including:
- Transforming the figure into a **half-cartoon style**
- Making the **book elongated**
- Turning the **sleeves into soft drapery**
- Detailing the **buttons with golden filigree**
- Presenting the **library shelves as a wooden frame background**, enhancing scholarly atmosphere

From this, we can extract what is explicitly allowed to change:

- **Figure’s style**: "Half-cartoon" implies stylization (e.g., exaggerated proportions, simplified features) — allowed
- **Book shape**: “Elongated book” — size/proportion change allowed
- **Sleeve form**: “Soft drapery” — silhouette and texture of sleeves changed — allowed
- **Button design**: “Golden filigree” — material and detail of buttons changed — allowed
- **Shelf presentation**: “Wooden frame background” — suggests repurposing shelves into a decorative border or frame — allowed
- **Overall scene tone**: “Art calendar page” — format and composition may be altered for aesthetic layout — allowed

However, no instruction says to remove or alter:
- The **identity of the subject** (a young woman reading)
- The **act of reading** (interaction with book)
- The **presence of the desk lamp**, especially its **green shade**
- The **open book(s)** on the desk
- The **general position** of the figure (seated at a desk, facing right)
- The **lighting direction** (from the right via lamp and left via window)
- The **texture of the book pages** (yellowed, aged appearance)
- The **window with grid pattern**
- The **wooden desk surface**
- The **stacked books** behind the main one

Thus, only specific elements listed above are permitted to change; all others must remain consistent unless implied by context.

---

**Allowed Changes List:**
- Style of the figure (transition to half-cartoon)
- Shape and length of the book
- Sleeve design (transformed into soft drapery)
- Button details (replaced with golden filigree)
- Library shelves (repurposed into a wooden frame background)
- Overall artistic style (to match art calendar format)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
We now determine which elements **must not change**, based on exclusion from the allowed list and core identity/function logic.

**Core recognition elements:**  
- The **subject is a female figure** engaged in reading — this identity must remain recognizable.
- The **act of reading** (hand on book, gaze directed downward) must persist — it defines the scene's purpose.
- The **round wire-rimmed glasses** are distinctive facial accessories that contribute to character identity.
- The **green desk lamp** is a key visual anchor — its presence and color are essential for atmospheric continuity.
- The **grid-patterned window** provides environmental specificity and light source consistency.
- The **open book with yellowed pages** is central to the narrative — its existence and aged paper texture should be preserved even if elongated.

**Functional/logical association elements:**  
- The **position of the lamp relative to the book** must remain (right side), as it explains the direction of light and shadows.
- The **placement of the figure at the desk**, leaning forward, maintains logical interaction with the book.
- The **stacked books** on the desk serve as contextual evidence of a study environment — their presence supports realism and coherence.

**Non-modified element deduction:**  
Even though sleeves and buttons are to be modified, other aspects like:
- The **gray-blue vest body**
- The **cream sleeve base color** (before drapery transformation)
- The **hair bun structure**
- The **facial profile and orientation**
- The **wooden desk surface texture**
- The **aged book covers**
- The **vertical alignment of the bookshelf rows**

are not mentioned for change and thus must be retained unless altered by implication (e.g., shelf-to-frame conversion affects spatial arrangement but not individual book presence).

**Preservation Targets List:**
- The presence and position of the green desk lamp
- The grid-patterned window on the left wall
- The open book with yellowed pages on the desk
- The figure's seated posture at the desk, leaning forward
- The round wire-rimmed glasses on the face
- The wooden desk surface with visible grain
- The stack of books behind the main open book
- The dark hair in a bun with loose strands framing the face
- The aged texture of the book pages
- The directional lighting from the lamp and window

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

Q1:  
Thinking process: The green desk lamp is a critical visual identifier in the original image, providing both functional lighting and distinct color contrast. Its presence and green shade are unique to the scene and help establish mood and authenticity. Even if stylized, its color and position must be preserved to maintain visual consistency. If removed or replaced, the scene loses a key atmospheric element. This is a core identity feature tied to the environment and lighting setup, hence weighted at 3 points.  
Question: Is the green-shaded desk lamp present on the right side of the desk?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The grid-patterned window is a defining architectural feature in the background, contributing to the depth and natural lighting of the scene. It is not mentioned for modification in the instructions and serves as a structural anchor. Its removal or alteration would disrupt the spatial logic and lighting cues. As a key environmental element, its retention ensures scene coherence, warranting a weight of 2 points.  
Question: Is the vertical window with a grid pattern visible on the left side of the image?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The open book with visibly aged, yellowed pages is central to the narrative of reading and scholarship. Although the instruction allows elongation, the fundamental attribute of being an open book with readable text and aged paper must remain. Losing this would break the core action of the scene. Thus, it is a key functional object, deserving a weight of 3 points.  
Question: Is there an open book with yellowed pages on the desk in front of the figure?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The round wire-rimmed glasses are a distinctive accessory that contributes to the character’s identity and expression. They are not mentioned for change, and altering them could misrepresent the figure’s appearance. Their shape and placement are essential for facial recognition and continuity. As a key personal attribute, they carry a weight of 2 points.  
Question: Are round wire-rimmed glasses visible on the figure’s face?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The figure’s seated posture at the desk, leaning forward with her hand on the book, defines the action and engagement in the scene. This pose is crucial for conveying focus and intent. While style may shift to cartoonish, the physical positioning must remain to preserve narrative logic. It is a core functional posture, so it is assigned 2 points.  
Question: Is the figure seated at the desk with her body leaning forward toward the open book?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The wooden desk surface with visible grain texture grounds the scene in realism and provides a tactile base for the objects. Though the instruction mentions artistic transformation, the material and surface detail are not specified for change. Retaining the wood grain ensures environmental consistency and avoids surrealism that breaks immersion. This is a secondary but important detail, worth 1 point.  
Question: Is the desk made of wood with visible grain texture?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The stack of books behind the main open book adds depth and context to the scholarly setting. Though not the primary focus, their presence reinforces the library environment. Since they are not mentioned for removal or modification, they must be preserved to maintain environmental logic. This is a minor but supportive detail, hence 1 point.  
Question: Are there multiple stacked books located behind the main open book on the desk?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q8:  
Thinking process: The dark hair styled in a bun with loose strands framing the face is a key part of the character’s appearance. It is not referenced for change, and altering it would affect identity recognition. The bun structure and hair flow are visually distinctive and must be retained for continuity. This is a secondary identity feature, so it receives 1 point.  
Question: Is the figure’s dark hair styled in a bun with loose strands falling near the face?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1
