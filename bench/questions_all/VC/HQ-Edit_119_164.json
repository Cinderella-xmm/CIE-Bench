      "thinking_process": "The acacia trees are iconic to African savannas and serve as key environmental identifiers. Their flat-topped silhouette is distinct and non-transferable; replacing them with other tree types would fundamentally alter the setting. Since the instruction does not mention modifying them, they must remain. This element is essential for geographical and ecological recognition, making it a core scene feature. Loss would make the scene unrecognizable as African savanna.",
      "question": "Are the flat-topped acacia trees visible in the background, maintaining their characteristic silhouette and spacing?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The golden-brown savanna grass defines the foreground and midground terrain. Its texture and height contribute to depth and realism. Changing its color or density would break the naturalism of the scene. Since no alteration is instructed, the grass must remain consistent with the original. It is a major environmental component that supports the elephant’s placement and scale.",
      "question": "Is the tall, golden-brown savanna grass present throughout the foreground and midground, matching the original texture and density?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The sky’s color gradient—from orange near the horizon to deep red and purple above—is a defining atmospheric feature. It establishes the time of day (sunset) and lighting mood. Altering this would change the entire ambiance and lighting logic. As the instruction does not mention modifying the sky, it must remain unchanged. This is a core environmental element affecting all visual cues.",
      "question": "Does the sky display a continuous gradient from warm orange near the horizon to deep red and purple at the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The horizon line separates sky from land and anchors the composition. Its straightness and position determine the spatial relationship between the elephant and the environment. Moving or distorting it would disrupt perspective and balance. Since the instruction does not alter the scene layout, this structural element must be preserved.",
      "question": "Is the horizon line clearly visible and straight, dividing the sky from the savanna landscape at approximately one-third up the image?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The warm lighting direction, casting soft highlights on the elephant’s back and sides and creating long shadows, is critical for depth and realism. This lighting originates from the low sun in the sky. Any change in light angle or intensity would contradict the sunset setting. Since no new lighting is specified, the original illumination must be retained.",
      "question": "Is the lighting consistent with a low-angle sunset, producing warm highlights on the upper surfaces of the elephant and grass, and casting long shadows behind the subject?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The elephant’s central, frontal position within the frame is a compositional choice that draws focus. Shifting it off-center or rotating it would change the narrative impact. While the elephant’s form is transformed, its **placement in space** is not mentioned as altered, so it must remain centered. This maintains visual balance and alignment with the original framing.",
      "question": "Is the elephant positioned centrally in the frame, facing directly toward the viewer with its body aligned vertically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The absence of additional elements such as rivers, rocks, or animals in the background suggests a minimalist savanna scene. Adding such elements without instruction would introduce inconsistency. The original simplicity must be preserved to maintain coherence. Though minor, these absences define the scene’s character.",
      "question": "Are there no visible water bodies, rocky outcrops, or other animals in the background beyond the acacia trees and grass?",

      "thinking_process": "The texture of the grass blades, especially in the foreground, contributes to realism. While not a core identifier, it enhances visual fidelity. Blurring or smoothing it would reduce detail and coherence. Since no textural modification is requested, it should remain consistent.",
      "question": "Do the grass blades in the foreground show individual strands with slight variation in length and direction, contributing to a natural texture?",
