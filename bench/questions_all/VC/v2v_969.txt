### Thinking Process:
The editing instructions specify transforming the image into a snow globe while retaining certain elements. The characters are to be depicted as chibi-style 3D figures inside the globe, with a miniature baseball field and a light layer of snow. The exterior of the globe is described as resting on a rustic wooden shelf with a vintage baseball clubhouse backdrop. 

#### Allowed Changes List:

2. **Scene Environment**: Background changes to a vintage baseball clubhouse with a rustic wooden shelf.
3. **Interior Scene Details**: Addition of a miniature baseball field, snow layer, and other props like bats against the fence.
4. **Lighting and Atmosphere**: Adjustments to lighting to create a warm, golden reflection.

#### Preservation Targets List:
1. **Baseball Uniforms and Helmets**: The "Twins" text and helmet design must remain recognizable.
2. **Baseball Bats**: The presence of bats held by the players should be retained.
3. **Central Figure's Position and Attire**: The central figure's position between the two players and his blue jacket should be preserved.
4. **Facial Expressions**: The cheerful expressions of the characters should be maintained.
5. **Proportional Relationships**: The relative positions and proportions of the characters should remain consistent.
