**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a large, intricately carved wooden elephant sculpture standing in profile, facing right. The sculpture is highly detailed with ornate patterns covering its body, including floral and geometric motifs, particularly on the head, ears, back, and legs. It features long, curved tusks, a curled trunk, and decorative bands around its ankles. The surface has a rich, warm brown tone with visible wood grain and polished finish. The elephant wears an elaborate headdress and neck adornments resembling traditional ceremonial attire. It stands on a simple, rectangular white pedestal placed on a polished wooden floor. The background is a neutral gray wall with soft lighting from above, casting subtle shadows beneath the sculpture. The overall composition emphasizes the craftsmanship and cultural aesthetic of the piece.

**Thinking process:**  
First, analyze the editing instructions word by word:  
- "Transform the elephant sculpture into a whimsical 3D scene within an ornate glass display case" → The **form and context** of the subject are to be changed; the sculpture is no longer standalone but embedded in a new environment.  
- "Miniaturize the elephant" → Size change allowed.  
- "Add intricate golden inlays" → Material/texture modification permitted.  
- "Surround it with tiny bonsai trees" → New environmental elements introduced.  
- "Incorporate a lush, miniature jungle depicted in vibrant, earthy tones" → Scene transformation: background and surrounding environment must change.  
- "The base should mimic a smooth, polished stone with engraved floral details" → Base material and design change allowed.  

Thus, the following are **allowed changes**:  
- Scale (miniaturization)  
- Material additions (golden inlays)  
- Environmental context (glass display case, bonsai trees, jungle)  
- Base design (from plain white pedestal to stone-like with engravings)  
- Lighting and color scheme (to match "vibrant, earthy tones")  

However, the instruction does **not** say to alter or remove the **core identity** of the elephant—its form, posture, carving style, or symbolic adornments. While the scene and scale can change, the **subject remains an elephant**, and its **iconic sculptural features** must still be recognizable.

---

**Allowed Changes List:**  
- Size of the elephant (miniaturized)  
- Addition of golden inlays on surface  
- Surrounding environment (bonsai trees, jungle, glass case)  
- Base material and design (stone-like with floral engravings)  
- Overall scene composition (whimsical 3D setting)  
- Color palette (adjusted to vibrant, earthy tones)  

---

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
Core recognition elements:  
- The **elephant’s shape**—specifically its four-legged stance, trunk curl, ear shape, and tusk curvature—are essential for identifying the subject as an elephant. These cannot be altered beyond recognition.  
- The **ornate carving style**—the intricate patterns on the body, especially on the head, ears, and legs—are unique to this artwork and define its cultural and artistic identity. Even if golden inlays are added, the **underlying carved structure** must remain intact.  
- The **headdress and ceremonial adornments**—these are key visual identifiers that suggest cultural significance (e.g., Indian or Southeast Asian tradition). Their presence and placement must be preserved.  
- The **tusks**—long, curved, and positioned symmetrically—are iconic features of elephants and must remain present and correctly shaped.  
- The **trunk’s curl**—a defining posture indicating calmness or elegance—is part of the sculpture’s expressive character and must not be distorted.  

Functional/logical association elements:  
- The **relationship between the elephant and its base**—while the base may be redesigned, the elephant must still stand on it, maintaining physical support logic.  
- The **orientation of the elephant**—facing right in profile—should be retained unless explicitly rotated, which is not stated.  

Non-modified element deduction:  
After excluding allowed changes (size, environment, base material), the **original carving patterns**, **anatomical structure**, **adornments**, and **posture** must remain. Even if miniaturized or recontextualized, these features are critical to preserving the identity of the original sculpture.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
- The elephant's anatomical form: four legs, trunk, ears, tusks  
- The intricate carved patterns on the body, especially on the head, ears, and back  
- The ceremonial headdress and neck adornments  
- The curled trunk and symmetrical tusks  
- The profile orientation (facing right)  
- The presence of ankle bands around the legs  
- The overall posture (standing upright, calm demeanor)

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The curled trunk is a core identity feature of this specific elephant sculpture. Its shape and position are distinctive and contribute to the sculpture's serene expression. If lost or straightened, the sculpture would lose its characteristic pose and emotional tone. This is a key identifying feature, making it a 3-point element.
    Question: Is the trunk curled upward at the tip?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The long, curved tusks are essential to the elephant’s identity. Their length and symmetry are visually dominant and help distinguish this sculpture from others. Removing or shortening them would fundamentally alter the subject’s appearance and make it unrecognizable as the original piece.
    Question: Are both tusks present and curved outward in a symmetrical fashion?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The ornate headdress is a signature feature of the sculpture, indicating cultural significance and artistic intent. It is intricately designed and covers the top of the head. Its absence would remove a major identifying element, especially given its prominence in the original image.
    Question: Is the headdress with detailed carvings covering the top of the elephant’s head present?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The ankle bands are small but consistent details across all four legs. They are part of the ceremonial design and add authenticity to the sculpture. Their removal would diminish the cultural accuracy and visual completeness of the piece.
    Question: Are there decorative bands around each of the elephant’s four ankles?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The carved patterns on the body, especially the floral and geometric designs on the side and back, are central to the sculpture’s artistic identity. These patterns are not just decoration—they define the work’s style. Even if golden inlays are added, the underlying carved texture must remain visible and consistent.
    Question: Are intricate floral and geometric carvings visible on the side and back of the elephant’s body?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The profile orientation (facing right) is a fixed compositional choice in the original image. Changing the direction would alter the viewer’s perception and break continuity. Since the instruction does not specify rotation, this orientation must be preserved.
    Question: Is the elephant facing to the right side of the image?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The neck adornment, resembling layered chains or fringes, is a key accessory that adds depth and cultural richness. Its presence distinguishes this sculpture from generic elephant depictions. Even with added gold, the original form must remain.
    Question: Is there a decorative necklace or fringe-like adornment around the elephant’s neck?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}
{
    Q8: 
    Thinking process: The feet have distinct, rounded toe pads that are part of the realistic yet stylized rendering. These are minor but contribute to the overall anatomical accuracy and craftsmanship. Their loss would reduce detail fidelity.
    Question: Do the feet show individual toe pads with rounded shapes?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
