      "thinking_process": "The cat’s white fur is a core identity feature distinguishing it from other animals or colored cats. If the fur were changed to black or multicolored, it would no longer be visually identifiable as the same subject. This is a key recognition element, thus weighted 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the cat's fur predominantly white?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The upright sitting posture is essential to the cat’s identity and interaction with the environment. If the cat were lying down or standing, it would alter the scene’s narrative and visual balance. This is a key structural element, hence weighted 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the cat sitting upright on the sand with front paws forward?",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The hot dog with mustard is a central narrative object. Its presence and specific appearance (bun, sausage, mustard zigzag) are crucial to the scene’s humor and context. Losing these details would remove a key element of the image’s story. Thus, it is a high-weight element.",
      "question": "Is there a hot dog in a bun with a zigzag of mustard on top, placed in front of the cat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The harness with a visible buckle and pouch is a distinctive accessory that contributes to the cat’s “beach-ready” character. Even if stylized, its structure must remain recognizable. Removing or altering it would affect the character’s identity and function.",
      "question": "Is there a harness around the cat's neck and chest with a visible buckle and a pouch-like attachment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The sunglasses are a defining stylistic feature. While their color is specified to change to flat orange, their shape and placement on the face must remain unchanged to preserve the cat’s “cool” persona. This is a critical accessory element.",
      "question": "Are the sunglasses positioned over the cat's eyes, covering the upper part of the face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The cat’s whiskers are a minor but distinct facial feature that aids in animal identification. Their presence helps distinguish the cat from other animals. While not critical for identity alone, they contribute to visual coherence and realism.",
      "question": "Are there visible white whiskers extending from the cat's muzzle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The tail’s position (curled beside the body) adds to the cat’s relaxed posture and spatial composition. Though minor, it contributes to the overall naturalness of the pose and should be preserved for consistency.",
      "question": "Is the cat's tail curled slightly to the right side of its body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q8",
      "thinking_process": "The mustard on the hot dog is a key detail that identifies the food item. The zigzag pattern is characteristic of typical hot dog toppings. Altering or removing it would make the food unrecognizable.",
      "question": "Is the mustard applied in a zigzag pattern across the top of the hot dog?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
