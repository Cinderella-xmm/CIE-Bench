      "thinking_process": "The dark brown wavy hair is a core identification feature of the subject. Its color and texture are distinctive and help differentiate her from other individuals. Although the instruction allows for transformation into a LEGO-style hairpiece, the instruction specifies that the subject’s calm and professional demeanor should be reflected, which includes the hair’s length and style. The hair’s wavy nature and dark brown color are essential to maintaining her identity. Losing this would result in a misrepresentation of the original subject. Therefore, the presence and color of the hair must be preserved in the stylized form.",

      "thinking_process": "The light blue color of the shirt is explicitly referenced in the instruction as part of the color palette to be used in the LEGO design. This indicates that the shirt’s color is a key attribute to retain. It serves as a visual anchor linking the original and edited versions. Changing the color would break the thematic consistency and could lead to misidentification of the subject. The color is not just decorative but tied to the subject’s identity and the aesthetic direction of the edit.",

      "thinking_process": "The chest pocket on the left side of the shirt is a specific detail that contributes to the subject’s visual identity. It is a unique structural feature that distinguishes her attire from generic shirts. While the instruction allows for stylization, it does not permit removal of defining clothing elements. Retaining the pocket ensures that the LEGO version remains faithful to the original subject’s outfit. Its absence would make the shirt appear generic and reduce visual accuracy.",
      "question": "Is there a chest pocket on the left side of the subject's shirt in the edited image?",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The subject’s hands are positioned on the laptop keyboard, indicating active engagement with the device. This functional interaction is central to the scene’s narrative of professionalism. The instruction requires the subject to be seated at a desk with a laptop, implying that the action of typing must be preserved. Even in LEGO form, the hands must be shown in contact with the keyboard to maintain logical coherence. Removing or altering this would undermine the purpose of the scene.",
      "question": "Are the subject's hands positioned on the laptop keyboard in the edited image?",
      "choices": [

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The subject’s posture—upright, facing slightly to her right, with her head turned toward the laptop—is a key aspect of her demeanor. This orientation conveys focus and professionalism. The instruction emphasizes a calm and professional demeanor, which is expressed through body language. Altering the posture would change the emotional tone and misrepresent the original intent. Therefore, the directional orientation and forward-facing stance must be preserved.",
      "question": "Is the subject facing slightly to her right with her head turned toward the laptop in the edited image?",

      "thinking_process": "The presence of a laptop is a core functional element in the scene. The instruction specifies a compact desk with a laptop, confirming that the device must be included. While the laptop may be stylized, its presence is essential to the subject’s activity. Without it, the scene loses its context and purpose. The laptop is not just a background object but a key prop in the narrative of work and focus.",
