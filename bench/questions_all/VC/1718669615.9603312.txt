**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a large, white, disc-shaped UFO hovering above a landscape. The UFO has a smooth, metallic surface with a central dome structure on top, featuring a horizontal row of glowing blue windows or lights along the upper edge. Below the dome, the body of the craft displays subtle paneling, vents, and structural ridges. On the underside, there is a visible circular engine or propulsion unit emitting faint red lights, suggesting active operation. The UFO is positioned centrally in the frame, slightly tilted forward, floating above a multi-lane elevated railway track that stretches into the distance, curving gently to the right. The railway consists of parallel rails and concrete supports, surrounded by green forested areas and open fields. In the background, distant mountains rise under a dramatic sky filled with voluminous clouds illuminated by golden sunlight from the horizon. The lighting creates soft shadows and highlights on the UFO’s surface, enhancing its three-dimensional form.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction states: *"Transform the spaceship into a Greek amphora painting, reshaping it with stylized circular motifs and intricate meanders. Alter the landscape below into elongated abstract waves using muted earth tones, echoing ancient pottery aesthetics."*  

This means:
- The **form and appearance of the spaceship** are explicitly to be transformed — not preserved. It can be reshaped into a flat, painted style resembling a Greek amphora, including decorative patterns like meanders and circles.
- The **landscape below** is also to be altered — specifically into "abstract waves" with "muted earth tones", mimicking ancient pottery art. This indicates the natural scenery (forests, rivers, tracks) should no longer appear realistic but instead stylized.
- However, the instruction does **not** specify changing the **position or orientation** of the object relative to the scene (e.g., still floating above the track), nor does it mention removing the **railway or its layout**, only how the land around it should be styled.

Therefore, while the **visual style** of both the UFO and the landscape is to be changed, certain **spatial relationships** and **structural elements** may still need to be preserved if they are implied as foundational.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
- The shape and design of the UFO (to become stylized with circular motifs and meanders)  
- The color scheme and texture of the UFO (to reflect ancient Greek pottery aesthetics)  
- The appearance of the landscape (to become abstract waves in muted earth tones)  
- The realism of the terrain, vegetation, and water bodies (to be replaced with stylized forms)  
- The overall artistic rendering of the scene (from photorealistic to symbolic/ancient pottery style)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
We now identify what must remain unchanged based on exclusion and logical necessity:

**Core recognition elements:**  
Although the UFO's **form** is allowed to change, its **identity as a flying saucer-type spacecraft** must still be recognizable after transformation. However, since the instruction says “transform into a Greek amphora painting,” this implies the **entire visual identity** of the object is being reinterpreted artistically — not just modified. Thus, **no core physical features** of the original UFO (like dome, windows, engine) need to be preserved *literally*, but their **functional placement** might still matter for coherence.

However, the instruction **does not** say to remove the railway or alter its fundamental path. Therefore, the **presence and trajectory** of the railway system must be retained in some form — even if stylized — because it defines the spatial context of the scene. If the railway were completely removed or distorted beyond recognition, the relationship between the UFO and the ground would be lost, breaking the original composition logic.

Additionally, the **relative position** of the UFO above the railway remains essential. Even if both are stylized, the UFO must still appear to float over the track, maintaining the **vertical alignment and scale relationship** established in the original.

Furthermore, **the directionality of the railway** — extending toward the horizon and curving to the right — is a key compositional element. Its curvature and convergence point create depth and perspective. If this is erased or reversed, the sense of space collapses.

Finally, **the horizon line** and **sky-to-ground division** are crucial for spatial grounding. While the sky may be repainted in earth tones, the **division between sky and land** must persist to maintain scene coherence.

**Functional/logical association elements:**  
The UFO is shown hovering directly over the railway. This positioning suggests a narrative or observational intent — perhaps surveillance or interaction. Changing this would disrupt the implied logic of the scene. Hence, the **spatial relationship** — UFO above the track — must be preserved.

**Non-modified element deduction:**  
After excluding changes to form, color, and texture of the UFO and landscape, we retain:
- The **layout of the railway**: dual tracks, curves, elevation
- The **direction and flow** of the railway into the distance
- The **horizontal plane** of the landscape beneath the UFO
- The **overall perspective** — vanishing point at the horizon
- The **relative height** of the UFO above the ground

These are not mentioned as editable, so they must be preserved, albeit in stylized form.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
- The railway track system with two parallel lines extending into the distance  
- The curved trajectory of the railway turning to the right  
- The elevated nature of the railway (raised above surrounding terrain)  
- The UFO’s position directly above the center of the railway  
- The horizon line separating sky and land  
- The general perspective depth created by converging lines of the track

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The railway track is a dominant structural feature in the original image, defining the foreground and leading the viewer’s eye toward the horizon. Its presence and layout are essential for spatial orientation. Even if stylized, the track must remain identifiable as a linear pathway with two parallel rails, extending forward and curving to the right. Losing this would destroy the scene’s coherence and break the visual narrative. Therefore, preserving the track’s existence and direction is critical.
    Question: Does the edited image retain the presence of two parallel railway tracks extending into the distance?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The curve of the railway to the right is a distinctive compositional choice that adds dynamism and depth. It differentiates the scene from a straight-line perspective and guides the viewer’s gaze. If this curve is removed or flattened, the sense of movement and spatial progression is lost. Since the instruction does not mention altering the track’s path, it must be preserved in form, even if rendered abstractly.
    Question: Is the railway track visibly curved to the right as it recedes into the distance?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The UFO is positioned directly above the center of the railway, creating a clear vertical alignment. This spatial relationship is crucial for maintaining the original scene’s balance and narrative. If the UFO shifts laterally or appears detached from the track, the intended focus and meaning are disrupted. Even when transformed into an amphora-style painting, the UFO must remain centered over the track to preserve logical consistency.
    Question: Is the UFO positioned directly above the central axis of the railway track?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The horizon line separates the sky from the land and establishes the scene’s depth. It is a foundational element of perspective. Although the sky and land will be stylized, the boundary between them must remain intact to preserve spatial structure. Without this line, the scene loses its sense of scale and environment.
    Question: Is there a clear horizontal line separating the sky from the land in the image?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The railway is elevated on a concrete or earthen embankment, rising above the surrounding forested terrain. This elevation is visually distinct and contributes to the sense of infrastructure within nature. Even if abstracted, the raised nature of the track must be preserved to maintain the original spatial hierarchy. Removing this would flatten the scene unnaturally.
    Question: Is the railway track visibly elevated above the surrounding ground level?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The original image shows the railway converging toward a single vanishing point on the horizon, creating linear perspective. This is a core visual cue for depth. While the instruction allows stylistic abstraction, the convergence of the tracks must remain evident to preserve spatial logic. If the lines diverge or run parallel without convergence, the illusion of depth collapses.
    Question: Do the railway tracks converge toward a single point on the horizon?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
