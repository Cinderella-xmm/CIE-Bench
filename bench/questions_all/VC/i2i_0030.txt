### Thinking Process for Determining Unchanged Elements:
- **Core Recognition Elements**: The variety and arrangement of the fruits, as well as their textures and colors, are crucial for maintaining the identity of the fruit platter. Changing the types of fruits would make it unrecognizable as the "Daily Vitamin C Supply Plate."
- **Functional/Logical Association Elements**: The relative positioning of the fruits must be preserved to maintain the visual appeal and coherence of the platter.
- **Non-modified Elements**: The detailed textures of the fruits, such as the cross-sections of the kiwi and the seeds of the watermelon, should be retained for visual accuracy.

### Preservation Targets List:
- The types of fruits present in the platter.
- The colors and textures of the fruits.
- The arrangement and relative positioning of the fruits.
- The presence of the white plate and golden tray.
