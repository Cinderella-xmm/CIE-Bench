### Step 1 - Analyzing Allowed Changes and Reference Image Description

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a giraffe standing upright on a grassy area, facing forward. Its body displays a distinctive pattern of brown patches outlined in white, characteristic of giraffes. The giraffe has two small ossicones on top of its head, large ears, and a long neck. The background consists of a natural setting with green trees and large rocks, providing a serene outdoor environment.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instructions specify transforming the giraffe into a collection of Russian nesting dolls with a chibi theme. This means the giraffe's physical form will change significantly. However, the giraffe's iconic pattern and some structural features may still need to be represented in the dolls. The scene will shift entirely to a wooden table, so the background elements like trees and rocks are not required to be retained.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
- The giraffe's physical form can be changed into Russian nesting dolls.
- The scene can be replaced with a wooden table.
- The number of giraffes can be increased to five, arranged in descending sizes.
- The aspect ratio can be adjusted to 3:2 horizontal.

### Step 2 - Determining Elements That Should Remain Unchanged

**Thinking process:**  
Core recognition elements include the giraffe's distinctive brown and white pattern, which should be reflected in the design of the nesting dolls. Functional/logical association elements include the arrangement of the dolls in descending sizes, as specified. Remaining elements like the ossicones and general body structure should also be retained in a stylized form for visual coherence.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
- Giraffe's brown and white pattern  
- Ossicones on the head  
- General body structure (long neck, legs)  
- Descending size arrangement  

### Step 3 - Generating Questions
