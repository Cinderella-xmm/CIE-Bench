      "thinking_process": "The pink-red flowering plants are iconic elements of the scene, providing botanical context and visual balance. Their distinct feathery structure and vibrant color make them identifiable and non-replaceable within the original composition. Since the instruction does not mention modifying them, their presence and general form must be preserved. Losing them would disrupt the ecological and aesthetic harmony of the image, making it inconsistent with the original. This is a core scene element, thus weighted at 3 points.",
      "question": "Are the pink-red feathery flower clusters present in both the foreground and background, positioned on slender green stems?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The reflection of the dragonfly on the water surface is a central compositional feature, reinforcing symmetry and depth. It is not merely decorative but physically tied to the subject’s position. Even after transformation, the reflection must mirror the dragonfly’s location and orientation to maintain logical consistency. Altering or removing it would break the visual coherence of the scene. This is a critical functional element, so it is assigned 3 points.",
      "question": "Is there a clear, symmetrical reflection of the dragonfly visible on the water surface directly beneath it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The water surface itself is a foundational environmental element. Its smoothness, slight sparkle from light, and ability to reflect the subject are essential to the image’s mood and realism. The instruction does not suggest replacing or distorting the water, so its appearance—including texture, clarity, and floating particles—must be retained. This is an important scene element affecting overall atmosphere, hence 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the water surface calm and reflective, with small sparkling particles scattered across it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The dragonfly’s position directly above the water is crucial for the reflection to make sense. If it were moved higher or lower, the reflection would shift or become distorted. Since the instruction doesn’t specify repositioning, the height and hover posture must remain consistent. This spatial relationship is functionally necessary and affects scene logic, earning 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the dragonfly hovering just above the water surface, with its body parallel to the water plane?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The background lighting, particularly the sunbeam effect from the upper center, creates the image’s mood and directs attention. This directional light source is part of the original atmosphere and is not mentioned for change. Removing or shifting it would alter the emotional tone and visual hierarchy. While not the subject, it is a key environmental feature, thus worth 2 points.",
      "question": "Is there a bright, diffused light source in the upper center of the image, casting a golden glow through the green foliage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The green stems and leaves of the surrounding plants are minor but consistent elements that support the botanical setting. They frame the dragonfly and add depth. Though not as prominent as the flowers, their presence contributes to visual coherence. Since they are not targeted for change, they must be preserved. This is a detail-level element, so 1 point.",
      "question": "Are there slender green stems and leafy structures extending from the water, supporting the pink-red flowers?",

      "thinking_process": "The dappled sunlight filtering through the background foliage creates a naturalistic depth and enhances the sense of a forested wetland. This specific lighting pattern is unique to the original image and contributes to the overall ambiance. As no instruction mentions changing the background, this texture must remain. It is a secondary detail but helps preserve environmental authenticity, thus 1 point.",
      "question": "Is the background composed of blurred green foliage with visible patches of sunlight filtering through?",
