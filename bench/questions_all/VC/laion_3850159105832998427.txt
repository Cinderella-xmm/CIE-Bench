Description of reference image: The subject is a Gibson electric guitar, specifically a model resembling the iconic Les Paul design. It features a solid-body construction with a deep mahogany finish and a high-gloss varnish that highlights the wood grain. The body has two symmetrical cutaways on either side of the neck, forming the classic "horns" shape. The top surface is covered with a black pickguard that houses two humbucker pickups, each with four visible pole pieces. Below the bridge pickup is a chrome-plated Tune-o-matic bridge and stopbar tailpiece. On the lower bout of the body are four control knobs—two volume and two tone—and a three-way toggle switch positioned between them. The neck is made of maple with a dark rosewood fretboard featuring dot inlays at the 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 12th, 15th, 17th, 19th, and 21st frets. The headstock is black with the "Gibson" logo in gold script at the top center. Six tuning pegs (three on each side) are mounted on the headstock, with cream-colored plastic buttons. The strings run from the bridge over the pickups to the tuning pegs. The entire guitar is centered vertically against a plain white background, with no additional objects or scenery.

Thinking process:  
First, analyze the editing instructions word by word:  
- "Transform the guitar into an enchanted dragon" → indicates a complete metamorphosis of the subject’s form; thus, the original physical structure of the guitar can be altered significantly.  
- "Body as the beast's torso" → implies the body of the guitar becomes part of the dragon’s anatomy but does not specify retention of original texture or shape.  
- "Neck as its elongated, elegant neck" → allows transformation of the neck into a dragon’s neck, so original neck proportions and material may change.  
- "Replace the tuning pegs with golden, horn-like spikes" → explicitly changes the tuning pegs, so they are allowed to be modified.  
- "Embellish the fretboard with luminescent runes" → modifies the fretboard decoration, so fretboard appearance can change.  
- "Convert the strings into fiery tendrils" → replaces the strings entirely, meaning their physical presence as metal wires is no longer required.  
- "Morph the cutaway horns into majestic wings with intricate, scale-like patterns" → transforms the cutaways into wings, so their original shape and function are changed.  

Thus, **all structural components** of the guitar—body, neck, headstock, pickups, bridge, controls—are permitted to be reimagined in form and function under the fantasy transformation. However, the instruction does **not** say to remove or alter the **identity** of the object as a *Gibson* guitar. Therefore, **any element tied to brand identity** (e.g., the "Gibson" logo) must be assessed for whether it should be preserved. Also, **functional elements** such as the placement of controls or pickups might be retained in layout even if transformed, unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Allowed Changes List:  
- Tuning pegs → replaced with golden horn-like spikes  
- Fretboard → embellished with luminescent runes  
- Strings → converted into fiery tendrils  
- Cutaway horns → morphed into wings with scale-like patterns  
- Body → transformed into dragon torso  
- Neck → transformed into dragon neck  
- Pickups, bridge, tailpiece → likely transformed into dragon anatomy (e.g., internal organs, scales, etc.)  
- Control knobs and switch → possibly reimagined as magical elements (e.g., glowing orbs)  
- Overall shape and function of the guitar → completely changed into a mythical creature

Step 2 – Determine the elements that should remain unchanged  
Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements:  
- The "Gibson" logo on the headstock is a **brand-specific identifier**. Even if the guitar is transformed into a dragon, the instruction does not state to remove or obscure the logo. In fact, preserving the logo maintains the **origin of the object**, which is critical for recognizing the transformation as based on a real-world instrument. Without it, the edited image loses its reference point. This is analogous to retaining a famous painting’s signature when transforming it into a surreal scene—the origin remains identifiable.  
- The **position and orientation** of the headstock relative to the neck must remain consistent if the transformation preserves anatomical logic. The neck becomes the dragon’s neck, so the headstock must still be at the end of it—though its form may change.  
- The **overall vertical alignment** of the guitar (neck pointing upward) is implied by the instruction (“the neck as its elongated neck”)—suggesting that the orientation should be preserved for coherence.  
- The **number of strings** (six) is implied by the “fiery tendrils” transformation—since six tendril-like flames would correspond to six original strings. Thus, the count of strings must be preserved, even if their nature changes.  
- The **placement of the pickups** is not mentioned to be removed, but since they become part of the dragon’s anatomy, their spatial location (near the bridge and neck) may be preserved for continuity. However, their **visual form** is allowed to change.  
- The **color scheme** of the original guitar (mahogany body, black pickguard, chrome hardware) is not specified to be retained, so it can be altered. But the **texture of the wood grain** may be preserved as part of the dragon’s skin if the transformation incorporates organic materials.

Functional/logical association elements:  
- The **relationship between the neck and body** must be preserved—i.e., the neck extends from the upper part of the body, as in a real guitar. Even as a dragon, this connection must exist to maintain logical coherence.  
- The **string path** from bridge to headstock must be maintained in concept, even if realized as fiery tendrils. This ensures functional continuity: the dragon’s "strings" still originate from the bridge and terminate at the headstock area.

Non-modified element deduction:  
After excluding all elements explicitly allowed to change (tuning pegs, fretboard inlays, strings, cutaways, pickups), what remains?  
- The **"Gibson" logo** is not mentioned to be changed.  
- The **number of strings (six)** is implied by the transformation ("fiery tendrils")—if only five were present, the edit would be inconsistent.  
- The **orientation** of the guitar (vertical, neck up) is assumed in the transformation description.  
- The **headstock position** at the top of the neck is necessary for the dragon’s head to emerge logically.  
- The **relative positions of controls** (knobs and switch) may be preserved in layout, even if transformed into magical elements.

Preservation Targets List:  
- The "Gibson" logo on the headstock  
- The number of strings (six)  
- The vertical orientation of the guitar (neck pointing upward)  
- The position of the headstock at the top of the neck  
- The relative placement of the control knobs and switch on the lower bout of the body  
- The presence of two pickups (even if transformed)  
- The overall structural relationship between neck and body (neck extending from upper body)

Q1:  
Thinking process: The "Gibson" logo is the primary brand identifier of the guitar and a key visual element that anchors the object’s identity. If removed or obscured, the edited image loses its reference to the original product. Since the instruction does not state to remove it, and because transformations often preserve source identifiers (e.g., logos in product art), it must be retained. This is a core identity feature—without it, the image cannot be recognized as a Gibson-based transformation.  
Question: Is the "Gibson" logo in gold script visible on the headstock?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The number of strings is fundamental to the guitar’s identity and directly referenced in the transformation ("convert the strings into fiery tendrils"). If there are fewer or more than six tendrils, the edit fails to preserve the original instrument’s structure. Six is the standard for a six-string guitar, and the instruction implies a one-to-one conversion. Thus, the count must be preserved.  
Question: Are there exactly six fiery tendrils extending from the bridge to the headstock area?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The vertical orientation of the guitar is essential for the transformation to make sense. The neck becomes the dragon’s neck, which must extend upward from the body. If the guitar were rotated horizontally or inverted, the metaphor breaks down. The instruction assumes the original upright posture, so it must be preserved.  
Question: Is the guitar oriented vertically with the neck pointing upward?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The headstock must remain at the top of the neck to maintain anatomical logic in the transformation. If the headstock were moved or omitted, the dragon’s head would lack a proper origin point. Even if transformed into horns or a dragon’s skull, its position must align with the original headstock location.  
Question: Is the headstock located
