      "thinking_process": "The four-tray grid layout (2x2) is the foundational structure of the display. It organizes the pastries into a clear visual hierarchy and is essential for identifying the setup as a curated pastry station. Changing the number or arrangement would fundamentally alter the scene's identity. Therefore, the existence of exactly four trays in a 2x2 grid is a core structural feature that must be preserved.",
      "question": "Are there exactly four wooden trays arranged in a 2x2 grid?",

      "thinking_process": "The shell-like shape of the madeleines is a unique morphological feature distinguishing them from other pastries. This form is iconic and necessary for identification. Even under pop art stylization, the silhouette must remain recognizable to preserve the item's identity. Loss of this shape would misrepresent the pastry.",
      "question": "Do the madeleines retain their distinctive shell-shaped form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The label \"Madeleine\" must remain associated with the shell-shaped pastries to maintain correct labeling. Its position near the right-bottom tray is crucial for functional clarity. If moved or removed, the connection between name and product breaks, undermining the informational integrity of the display.",
      "question": "Is the label reading \"Madeleine\" positioned near the tray containing shell-shaped pastries?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The word \"craster\" is engraved on the front of each tray and serves as a brand identifier. Its presence and placement on all four trays are key to maintaining authenticity and commercial consistency. Removing or relocating it would compromise the product branding.",
      "question": "Is the word \"craster\" visibly engraved on the front of each of the four trays?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The parchment paper lining inside each tray is a functional and visual detail that separates the food from the wood. Its presence ensures hygiene and adds to the presentation. Even if stylized, it must remain evident within each tray to preserve the original context of serving.",
      "question": "Is parchment paper visible inside each of the four trays?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The oval shape of the Galette Bretonne is a defining characteristic that distinguishes it from other pastries. Its form must remain identifiable even under artistic enhancement to ensure correct classification. Losing this shape would result in misidentification.",
      "question": "Do the pastries in the top-right tray retain their oval, slightly flattened shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The sliced loaf bread in the bottom-left tray has a distinct rectangular cross-section with visible internal texture (possibly chocolate chips). This shape and internal structure are key to identifying it as a sliced loaf rather than a muffin or cookie. Preservation of this form is essential for accurate representation.",
      "question": "Are the pastries in the bottom-left tray clearly shaped as sliced loaf bread with visible internal texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
