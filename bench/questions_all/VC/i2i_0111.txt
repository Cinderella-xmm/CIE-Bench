Description of reference image: The subject is Vincent van Gogh’s iconic painting “The Starry Night,” featuring a swirling, vibrant night sky with luminous stars and a crescent moon. The sky is dominated by blue tones with streaks of yellow and white, creating an impressionistic effect. Below the sky, there is a small village with distinct houses, one of which has a tall, pointed spire. On the left side, a large, elongated cypress tree rises high towards the sky, mirroring the movement of the stars. The landscape beneath exhibits rolling hills with muted tones. The painting is characterized by its distinctive thick impasto technique and expressive, dynamic brushstrokes.

### Step 1 - Allowed Changes List:
- The format of the image can be adapted to fit a wall sticker, including size, proportions, and potential cropping.
- The background can be changed to mimic a bedroom feature wall while ensuring the artwork remains the focal point.
- Lighting conditions can be adjusted to simulate a glow-in-the-dark effect.

### Step 2 - Preservation Targets List:
Thinking process:
- Core recognition elements include Van Gogh’s signature brushstrokes, the swirling sky, the prominent stars, the crescent moon, the cypress tree, and the village with its church spire. These elements define the identity of the artwork.
- Functional/logical elements involve the spatial arrangement of the starry sky above the village and cypress tree, ensuring the composition remains intact.
- Remaining elements such as color shades and texture details contribute to visual coherence and should be preserved unless specified for change.

Preservation Targets List:
- The swirling vortex texture in the sky
- The placement and prominence of the crescent moon
- The detailed depiction of the cypress tree
- The village and church spire below the expansive sky
- The color palette and brushstroke texture
