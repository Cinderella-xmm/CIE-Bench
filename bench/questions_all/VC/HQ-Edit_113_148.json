      "thinking_process": "The tiered, multi-turreted structure of the sandcastle is its defining architectural identity. Changing its overall form would make it unrecognizable as a sandcastle, even if made of crystal. The presence of a central tower flanked by smaller ones is essential for identifying this specific type of sandcastle. Thus, preserving this configuration is critical.",
      "question": "Does the transformed sculpture retain a central tall spire flanked by multiple smaller turrets arranged symmetrically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The red flags on the turrets are iconic markers of the sandcastle’s playful, whimsical nature. Their presence at the top of each tower adds symbolic detail and distinguishes this structure from generic towers. Removing them or relocating them would diminish its identity as a child-built fantasy castle.",
      "question": "Are there small red flags positioned at the tip of each turret of the crystal sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The shovel is a functional object tied to the act of building. Its placement near the castle, partially submerged, suggests recent use. Moving it away or altering its angle would break the narrative logic of a constructed beach scene. Even if transformed, its location must remain consistent.",
      "question": "Is the shovel located in the foreground, angled toward the base of the castle, and partially submerged in reflective water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The clustering of shells at the base of the castle establishes spatial context and enhances realism. Replacing them with gemstones does not negate their role; their distribution pattern must remain to preserve the original scene’s logic. Dispersing them randomly would disrupt the sense of a constructed environment.",
      "question": "Are the gemstones (replacing seashells) grouped in a cluster at the foot of the crystal castle, similar to the original shell arrangement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The wave pattern in the background is not just decoration—it represents the ocean. Although reimagined as an etched design, the directionality and rhythm of the waves must match the original ocean’s movement. A static or unrelated pattern would fail to convey the same environmental context.",
      "question": "Does the frosted glass slab feature a continuous horizontal wave pattern that mimics the original ocean’s rolling motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The central spire is the tallest and most prominent feature of the castle. Its dominance in height and position anchors the entire structure. Losing this feature would distort the architectural hierarchy and reduce recognizability.",
      "question": "Is the tallest tower located centrally within the crystal sculpture, rising above all other structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The red shovel with yellow handle is a distinct object with unique color contrast. Even if transformed, its color scheme and shape should be recognizable. A fully different-colored or shaped tool would misrepresent the original intent.",
      "question": "Does the shovel retain a red blade and yellow handle, even if rendered in crystal or another material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
