      "thinking_process": "The **curly dark brown hair** is a core identity feature of the character. Its distinctive wave pattern and volume are critical for recognition. The instruction explicitly requires retaining \"curly hair details,\" meaning the **texture and curl structure** must remain intact even when scaled up in a chibi form. If these details are lost or simplified beyond recognition, the character becomes unidentifiable. This is a **core recognition element**, thus assigned **3 points**.",

      "thinking_process": "The **ornate armor design**, particularly the **shoulder pauldrons**, contains unique engraved patterns that define the character’s noble and martial identity. These are not generic but have specific shapes and symmetry. Even if rendered in enamel style, the **basic form and motif layout** must be preserved to maintain continuity. Losing them would result in a different character. This is a **core identity feature**, hence **3 points**.",

      "thinking_process": "The **deep red cloak** is a major visual component, contributing to the character’s regal and dramatic presence. While color might be adjusted slightly for enamel effect, the **presence and drape** of the red fabric over the shoulders must be maintained. Removing or changing it fundamentally alters the character’s appearance. This is an **important accessory**, affecting identity and scene consistency, thus **2 points**.",

      "thinking_process": "The **blue eyes** are a defining facial feature, contrasting with the dark hair and armor. They are central to the character’s expression and identity. Even in stylized form, the **color and placement** of the eyes must remain consistent. Altering eye color or removing them would compromise recognition. This is a **key facial identifier**, therefore **3 points**.",
      "question": "Are the character’s blue eyes clearly visible and retained in the same position on the face?",

      "thinking_process": "The **high collar with decorative trim** is part of the armor’s upper structure and contributes to the character’s formal, noble look. It is a **distinctive silhouette element** that separates this character from others. Even in chibi form, its **shape and position** must be preserved. Its loss would make the armor appear incomplete. This is a **structural detail** vital for consistency, thus **2 points**.",
      "question": "Is the high collar with its decorative edge still present around the neck area?",

These are **iconic motifs** that help identify the armor as belonging to this specific character. Their absence would suggest a different character or rank. This is a **core design feature**, hence **3 points**.",

      "thinking_process": "The **facial structure**, including the **jawline, nose shape, and cheekbones**, defines the character’s likeness. While stylized, the **underlying proportions** must match the original to maintain identity. A completely reshaped face would break continuity. This is a **core facial identity element**, thus **3 points**.",
