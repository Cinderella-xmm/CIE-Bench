**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul, Turkey, a historic architectural landmark with a large central dome topped by a golden finial, surrounded by four slender minarets—two on each side. The main structure features a massive red-brick façade with arched windows and recessed niches, flanked by smaller domes and semi-domes forming a complex layered roofline. The building’s exterior displays weathered stone and brick textures, with visible signs of age and historical layers. The surrounding environment includes green trees in the foreground, a distant cityscape across the water, and the Bosphorus Strait visible in the background with ships and a bridge (the 15 July Martyrs Bridge) spanning it. The sky is clear and blue, indicating daytime lighting conditions.

Thinking process:  
The editing instruction explicitly transforms the Hagia Sophia into a **monumental sky guardian creature**, which implies a complete morphological transformation of the structure. Key changes include:
- **Metallic domes forming wings**: This indicates that the original dome shapes are to be reinterpreted as wing-like structures made of metal.
- **Minarets morphing into long, elegant legs**: The minarets are not just altered but transformed into limbs, changing their function and form entirely.
- **Intricate Byzantine patterns glowing with mystical energy**: These are new decorative elements to be added over or integrated into the surface.
- **Replacement of the central dome with a large, ever-watchful jewel reflecting cosmic wonders**: The central dome is replaced with a new object—a gem—implying removal of the original dome’s shape and material.

From this, we can deduce the following **allowed changes**:

Allowed Changes List:  
- Shape and function of the central dome (replaced with a jewel)  
- Shape and function of the minarets (transformed into legs)  
- Material and texture of domes (changed to metallic, forming wings)  
- Addition of glowing Byzantine patterns across the structure  
- Replacement of the central dome with a jewel-like eye reflecting cosmic imagery  
- Transformation of the entire building into a creature form (morphing into a guardian entity)  
- Introduction of mystical visual effects (glowing patterns, reflections)  

These changes allow for **complete reimagining of the structure’s form, materials, and symbolic role**, while still referencing the original building.

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

Thinking process:  
Despite the radical transformation described, certain elements must remain intact due to their **core identity value**, **functional logic**, or **visual coherence requirements**. We apply exclusion based on what is allowed to change.

1. **Core recognition elements**:  
   The Hagia Sophia is globally recognized by its **distinctive silhouette**, especially the **central dome**, **four minarets**, **semi-domes**, and **overall spatial arrangement**. However, the instruction allows the central dome and minarets to be transformed, so they are not preserved in their original form. But **the position and layout of these components relative to each other** may still need to be retained to maintain architectural coherence. For example, if the minarets become legs, their **original spatial positions** (left/right pairs) should be preserved to retain structural logic.

2. **Functional/logical association elements**:  
   The **building’s location** within the urban landscape—its proximity to the Bosphorus Strait, the bridge, and the distant city—is not mentioned as being changed. Therefore, the **background scene elements** such as the **water body, bridge, and skyline** must remain unchanged to preserve environmental context. Additionally, the **relative positioning** of the Hagia Sophia within the scene (e.g., elevated above trees, facing the strait) must be maintained to ensure logical spatial consistency.

3. **Non-modified element deduction**:  
   While the domes and minarets are to be transformed, the **original architectural details** such as the **arched windows**, **brickwork texture**, **smaller domes**, and **roofline contours** are not explicitly mentioned for alteration. These are **not allowed to be removed or fundamentally changed** unless implied by the transformation. However, since the transformation involves adding metallic wings and glowing patterns, some details may be obscured—but **their presence and placement** must still align with the original design.

Therefore, the **retained elements** are those that are **not explicitly altered** in the instruction and are essential for maintaining **scene integrity**, **spatial logic**, and **historical authenticity**.

Preservation Targets List:  
- The **presence and relative positions** of the four minarets (even if transformed into legs)  
- The **location of the Hagia Sophia** near the Bosphorus Strait  
- The **visible bridge** (15 July Martyrs Bridge) in the background  
- The **body of water** (Bosphorus) with boats and distant shoreline  
- The **tree line** in the foreground framing the base of the structure  
- The **arched window openings** on the main façade (shape and placement)  
- The **overall layered roof structure** with smaller domes and semi-domes (spatial arrangement)  
- The **clear sky** and daylight condition (lighting environment)  

Note: The **material** and **form** of the domes and minarets are allowed to change, but their **positions and functional roles** (as vertical supports and lateral extensions) must be preserved in the transformation.

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Retained Visual Elements**

Q1:  
Thinking process: The **presence of the four minarets** is a defining feature of the Hagia Sophia. Even though they are to be transformed into legs, their **original number and bilateral symmetry** (two on each side) are critical for architectural recognition. Losing this configuration would make the structure unrecognizable as the Hagia Sophia. The instruction does not suggest removing them, only transforming them, so their **positional layout** must be preserved. This is a core identity element, hence weight 3.  
Question: Are the four minarets positioned symmetrically—two on the left and two on the right—relative to the central dome?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3

Q2:  
Thinking process: The **bridge spanning the water in the background** is a key geographical identifier of Istanbul and provides contextual grounding. It is not mentioned in the instruction to be altered, so it must remain visible. Its presence confirms the location and scale. Removing or altering it would disrupt the scene’s realism and geographic accuracy. This is an important scene element, hence weight 2.  
Question: Is the 15 July Martyrs Bridge clearly visible in the background, crossing the water behind the Hagia Sophia?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2

Q3:  
Thinking process: The **body of water (Bosphorus Strait)** is essential for identifying the location and providing environmental context. The instruction does not mention replacing or obscuring it. Its presence is necessary for the scene to remain coherent and geographically accurate. This is a major scene element, hence weight 2.  
Question: Is a large body of water visible behind the Hagia Sophia, extending toward the horizon with boats on its surface?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2

Q4:  
Thinking process: The **foreground tree line** frames the lower portion of the Hagia Sophia and contributes to depth and natural setting. Though minor, its retention helps maintain visual balance and real-world plausibility. If removed, the structure appears floating. This is a detail-level element, hence weight 1.  
Question: Are green trees visible in the foreground, partially obscuring the base of the building?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1

Q5:  
Thinking process: The **arched windows on the main façade** are distinctive architectural features of the Hagia Sophia. Their shape and placement contribute to the building’s identity. Although the instruction allows for glowing patterns, it does not specify replacing the windows. Thus, their **existence and configuration** must be preserved. This is a secondary but identifiable detail, hence weight 1.  
Question: Are multiple arched windows visible on the front-facing wall beneath the central dome?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1

Q6:  
Thinking process: The **layered roof structure with smaller domes** around the central dome is a hallmark of the Hagia Sophia’s design. The instruction mentions transforming the central dome but not the surrounding ones. Their **arrangement and curvature** must remain consistent to preserve architectural authenticity. This is a key structural feature, hence weight 2.  
Question: Are several smaller domes visible around the base of the central dome, forming a tiered roofline?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2

Q7:  
Thinking process: The **clear blue sky and daylight lighting** establish the time of day and atmosphere. The instruction does not mention altering the lighting or sky. Preserving this ensures the scene remains visually coherent and realistic. This is a minor environmental detail, hence weight 1.  
Question: Is the sky uniformly clear and light blue, indicating daytime conditions without clouds?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1
