      "thinking_process": "The deep wrinkling and dark pigmentation of the central figure's skin are essential identifiers of her age and ethnicity. These features distinguish her from other characters and anchor her identity. If lost, the subject would no longer resemble the original elderly woman, undermining the continuity of the image. This is a core recognition feature, hence weighted at 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the elderly woman’s face clearly visible with deep wrinkles and dark skin texture?",

      "thinking_process": "The posture—standing upright with hands clasped in front—is a defining pose that establishes her presence and engagement with the market. Altering this would change her role and relationship to the environment. It is a critical functional element supporting narrative coherence, thus weighted at 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the central figure standing upright with her hands clasped in front of her?",

      "thinking_process": "The overhead canopy made of tanned fabric is a key environmental feature that defines the market’s shelter and lighting. Its removal would disrupt the spatial logic and atmosphere of the scene. As a major structural element, it must be preserved, earning a weight of 2 points.",
      "question": "Is there a large tanned fabric canopy stretched overhead, providing shade over the market?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The stone-paved ground and the arrangement of woven baskets filled with produce (such as tomatoes, oranges, green beans) are foundational to the market’s realism. Their presence grounds the scene and maintains visual consistency. Though goods may be symbolically enhanced, their physical containment in baskets on the ground must remain. This is a key environmental detail, so weighted at 2 points.",
      "question": "Are the market goods placed in woven baskets on a stone-paved ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The stack of bangles on both arms is a distinctive accessory that contributes to the character’s cultural identity. While additional bangles may be added, the original layered structure must remain intact. Losing this detail would diminish her cultural expression. It is a minor but significant detail, thus weighted at 1 point.",
      "question": "Are there multiple stacked bangles visible on both of the woman’s arms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The presence of mud-brick buildings with hanging textiles on either side of the alleyway establishes the architectural context. These elements are not mentioned for modification and are crucial to the setting’s authenticity. Their retention ensures the scene remains consistent with the original environment, making them important scene elements, hence 2 points.",
      "question": "Are there mud-brick buildings with hanging textiles lining both sides of the market alley?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The hand position holding a small wooden bowl is a functional detail that suggests participation in trade or ritual. It is a subtle but meaningful gesture tied to the narrative. Although the bowl may be embellished, its presence and position must be preserved. This is a minor but coherent detail, so weighted at 1 point.",
      "question": "Is the woman holding a small wooden bowl in her hands?",
