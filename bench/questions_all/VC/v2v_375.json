      "thinking_process": "The brown horse with its bridle and harness is a core visual element of the original image. Its presence and specific features—such as the color of the coat, the shape of the ears, the placement of the bridle, and the harness straps—are essential for identifying the scene as a horse-drawn carriage procession. Removing or altering this horse would destroy the fundamental transportation mechanism of the scene and make it unrecognizable. This is a key identity feature, hence weighted at 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the brown horse with bridle and harness present in the same position and configuration as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The ornate golden carriage with its distinctive gilded carvings and red velvet curtains is a central icon of the image. The specific design of the gilding, the curvature of the roof, and the red drapes are unique identifiers of the carriage’s opulence and historical context. Altering these would change the character of the vehicle and misrepresent the original artwork. This is a core structural element, thus weighted at 3 points.",
      "question": "Are the gilded carvings and red velvet curtains of the carriage preserved in their original form and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The coachman seated on the driver’s seat holding the reins is a functional and narrative anchor. His position, posture, and grip on the reins are essential for maintaining the logic of the scene. If he were removed or repositioned, the action of driving the carriage would be lost. This is a key functional element, so it is weighted at 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the coachman seated on the driver’s seat with his hands on the reins as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The walking attendant in the dark blue coat and tricorn hat, holding a riding crop, is a secondary but identifiable figure. His attire, pose, and location beside the horse contribute to the narrative completeness of the scene. While not the main focus, his presence supports the realism and historical accuracy. This is an important detail element, so it is weighted at 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the walking attendant in the dark blue coat and tricorn hat positioned beside the horse, holding a riding crop?",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The large wooden wheels with visible spokes are structural components of the carriage. Their size, shape, and arrangement are consistent with historical carriages and help identify the vehicle type. Altering them would affect the mechanical plausibility of the scene. This is a key structural detail, so it is weighted at 2 points.",
      "question": "Are the large wooden wheels with visible spokes preserved in their original form and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The pastoral background with trees and sky provides environmental context. While not the focal point, the presence of the tree line and sky helps establish the outdoor setting. Removing or replacing it without preserving the general layout would disrupt the scene’s atmosphere. This is a minor but coherent environmental element, so it is weighted at 1 point.",
      "question": "Is the background featuring trees and a sky with clouds preserved in its original composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The texture and color of the carriage’s gilding and fabric are essential for maintaining the visual richness and historical authenticity. The gold leaf patterns and red velvet drapes are specific to the original painting and contribute to its aesthetic value. Losing these textures would diminish the image’s fidelity. This is a detail-level element, so it is weighted at 1 point.",
      "question": "Are the gold leaf patterns and red velvet textures of the carriage preserved in their original appearance?",
