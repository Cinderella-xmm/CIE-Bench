Description of reference image: The subject is a red semi-truck parked on an asphalt road with a gravel shoulder. The truck has a distinct shiny chrome exhaust pipe, large wheels with visible lug nuts, and a prominent red grille featuring vertical slats and a small logo emblem. The cab has large windows and a chrome side mirror. The background consists of green grass, trees, and a clear blue sky with scattered clouds.

Thinking process:  
The instructions specify converting the image into a realistic cartoon rendering style with bolder lines and more vivid colors while simplifying the background. The structure of the truck should be retained, implying that the core shape, size, and position of major components (like the cab, wheels, and exhaust pipe) must stay consistent. The background can be simplified, indicating that the general environment details may change but the relative positioning of the truck (being outdoors) should remain intact. 

### Allowed Changes List:
- The truck's texture can be changed to a cartoon-like rendering.
- The color can become more vivid but the essential hue (red truck) should remain recognizable.
- The background (sky, trees, grass) can be simplified while preserving the overall outdoor setting.

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements include the truck's iconic red color, large chrome exhaust pipe, prominent grille shape, and the overall proportions of the semi-truck. Functional elements include the wheel positions and the alignment that suggest a typical semi-truck design. Lastly, visual coherence elements would consist of small details such as the grille slats and the shape of the windshield.

### Preservation Targets List:
- The truck's red color and chrome exhaust pipe.
- The structure and relative proportions of the truck.
- The wheel locations and their lug nut details.
- The grille design and emblem placement.
- The truck cab's large windows and side mirror.
