Removing or altering them would fundamentally change the setting and break the visual continuity of the Renaissance window-frame motif. This element is critical for identifying the scene’s structure and is not mentioned as changeable in the instructions, so it must be preserved. Its loss would make the scene unrecognizable as derived from the original.",

Even though the animal is replaced, the **gesture of holding something in both hands in the lap** must remain unchanged to preserve the functional logic of the pose. This action is essential to the subject’s identity and interaction within the scene. Altering this would disrupt the narrative consistency.",

The instruction changes the color and texture but does not mention altering the shape. Therefore, the **square cut of the neckline** must remain to preserve the garment’s identity and historical accuracy.",

      "thinking_process": "The **horizontal brown bands across the chest and waist** are unique design elements that distinguish the dress from other garments of the period. They serve as visual anchors and contribute to the garment’s identity. Since the instruction only changes color and texture, not structure, these bands must retain their **position and linear form** to maintain coherence with the original design.",
