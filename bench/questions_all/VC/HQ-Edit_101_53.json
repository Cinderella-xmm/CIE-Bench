      "thinking_process": "The facial wrinkles across the forehead are a core identification feature of the pug breed. They are unique to the species and distinguish it from other dogs. Even when transformed into a wooden sculpture, the presence and arrangement of these wrinkles must be preserved to maintain breed recognition. Their absence would render the sculpture unidentifiable as a pug. Thus, this is a key identity element.",
      "question": "Are the characteristic forehead wrinkles of the pug present and accurately represented in the sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The black muzzle and facial markings are essential to the pug’s appearance and are part of the original color pattern explicitly stated to be maintained. These markings define the contrast between the fawn body and dark face, a key visual identifier. If lost or altered in placement, the sculpture would no longer resemble the original pug.",
      "question": "Is the black muzzle and surrounding facial marking (including under the eyes and around the nose) preserved in the same location and shape as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The large dark eyes with visible pupils are central to the pug’s expressive face and contribute significantly to its identity. Even in a sculpted form, the eyes must retain their size, position, and depth to preserve the likeness. Their absence or distortion would compromise recognition.",
      "question": "Are the large, round, dark eyes with clearly defined pupils preserved in the same position and shape as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The floppy black ears are a distinctive trait of the pug, contributing to its overall silhouette and breed-specific look. Their position on top of the head and drooping shape are necessary for accurate representation. Changing their form or removing them would alter the subject’s identity.",
      "question": "Are the floppy black ears positioned symmetrically on top of the head and shaped as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The upright sitting posture with front paws forward is a defining pose in the original image. It contributes to the subject’s presence and balance. Altering this posture would change the composition and make the sculpture appear different from the source, affecting consistency.",
      "question": "Is the pug depicted in an upright sitting position with both front paws placed forward, matching the original stance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The fawn-colored body with a distinct contrast to the black facial mask is part of the original color pattern that must be preserved. Even though the material changes to wood, the spatial distribution of fawn and black areas must remain identical to maintain visual fidelity.",
      "question": "Is the fawn-colored body area preserved in the same region as the original, contrasting with the black facial mask?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The proportional relationship between the head and body is a key aspect of the pug’s physical identity. A disproportionately large or small head would misrepresent the breed. Since the sculpture must resemble the original, this proportion must be retained.",
      "question": "Is the head-to-body proportion consistent with the original pug, maintaining a broad head relative to the compact body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
