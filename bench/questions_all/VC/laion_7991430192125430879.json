      "thinking_process": "The Bacardi bat logo is the most iconic symbol of the brand and is essential for consumer recognition. Its unique design — a black bat with outstretched wings inside a red circle — is a registered trademark and must be preserved in any representation. If the bat shape, wing posture, or red background are altered or omitted, the brand identity is lost. This is a core identity element, hence weighted at 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the black bat with outstretched wings inside a red circle present on the label?",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The word \"BACARDÍ\" in bold black serif font is the primary brand identifier. Its specific font style, capitalization, and position directly above \"MOJITO\" are crucial for brand recognition. Any deviation in font or placement would misrepresent the product. This is a core identity feature, thus weighted at 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the word \"BACARDÍ\" displayed in bold black serif font above the word \"MOJITO\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The word \"MOJITO\" in green sans-serif font is the product identifier. Its color (green) and font style distinguish it from other Bacardi variants. Changing the color or font would confuse the product identity. This is a key element for product differentiation, so it is weighted at 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the word \"MOJITO\" written in green sans-serif font below \"BACARDÍ\"?",

      "thinking_process": "The signature \"Facundo Bacardí\" in cursive script is a historical and authenticating element tied to the brand’s heritage. Its presence reinforces authenticity and brand story. Though smaller, it is a distinctive visual mark. Losing it would reduce brand credibility. This is a key branding detail, hence weighted at 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the signature \"Facundo Bacardí\" in cursive script present below the product name?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The mint leaf icon is a direct visual cue for the flavor profile. Its presence is necessary to communicate the natural mint component. Even in LEGO form, the leaf shape must be recognizable. This supports product identity and is a secondary but important detail, so weighted at 2 points.",
      "question": "Is a mint leaf icon visible near the bottom of the label?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The text \"natural mint flavor, lime juice, cane sugar\" provides essential ingredient information. Its presence ensures transparency and matches consumer expectations. While font may vary slightly in LEGO form, the content must remain legible. This is a functional detail critical to product understanding, thus weighted at 2 points.",
      "question": "Are the words \"natural mint flavor, lime juice, cane sugar\" visible on the lower part of the label?",

      "thinking_process": "The instruction \"Simply pour over ice\" is a key usage directive. It guides consumption and reflects the ready-to-serve nature of the product. Retaining this text maintains functional clarity. This is a minor but informative detail, so weighted at 1 point.",
      "question": "Is the phrase \"Simply pour over ice\" present on the label?",

      "thinking_process": "The alcohol content \"15% ALC. BY VOL.\" is a legal and informational requirement. Its inclusion ensures compliance and informs consumers. While format may adapt to LEGO, the number and unit must be preserved. This is a regulatory detail, thus weighted at 1 point.",
      "question": "Is the text \"15% ALC. BY VOL.\" visible on the label?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q9",
      "thinking_process": "The overall silhouette of the bottle — with its curved body and narrow neck — is a structural hallmark of cocktail bottles. Even in LEGO form, the shape must reflect this to maintain product recognition. Altering proportions would make it unrecognizable as a Bacardi bottle. This is a core form element, so weighted at 3 points.",
      "question": "Does the bottle maintain a curved body with a narrow neck, resembling the original shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q10",
      "thinking_process": "The cap must remain cylindrical to preserve the realistic bottle form. While color may change (to blue), the shape must not deviate. A non-cylindrical cap would break the structural logic of a bottle. This is a functional form element, thus weighted at 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the cap cylindrical in shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
