**Step 1 – Analyze the Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a man and a woman standing side by side on a red carpet at the FIA Prize Giving 2013 event in Paris. The man is dressed in a classic black tuxedo with a white dress shirt and black bow tie, his hair gray and neatly combed. He stands slightly angled toward the camera with a slight smile. The woman wears a long black evening gown with a sequined bodice and a luxurious black fur coat draped over her shoulders; she holds a small black clutch in her left hand and wears dangling earrings. Her dark hair is styled in soft waves. Both are positioned centrally in front of a dark blue backdrop that features repeated logos: “FIA PRIZE GIVING 2013 PARIS” in white, surrounded by radiating lines forming a laurel-like emblem, alongside sponsor logos including PHILIPS, VOLKSWAGEN GROUP, and MICHELIN. The backdrop is uniformly patterned, with the central logo enlarged and centered behind the couple. The red carpet beneath them is smooth and evenly lit.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instructions describe transforming the image into a collectible art stamp with specific stylistic changes:
- The **couple** is to be rendered in a **semi-cartoon style**, with **exaggerated features**: the man’s tuxedo and the woman’s fur jacket are to be slightly exaggerated.
- The **background** is to be stylized using **simplified linear motifs** of the event’s emblem (the FIA Prize Giving logo).
- A **decorative, ribbon-like gold border** will frame the scene.
- The final product is to be presented on a **blue envelope embossed with a minimalist pattern of the event's logo**.

From this, we extract what can be changed:
- **Style of the figures**: Semi-cartoon rendering allows for exaggeration in proportions and outlines.
- **Tuxedo and fur jacket**: Slight exaggeration permitted — meaning shape, thickness, or silhouette may be altered for stylistic effect.
- **Background design**: To be simplified into linear motifs — thus the full logo repetition and detailed branding can be abstracted.
- **Frame and presentation**: The addition of a gold ribbon border and placement on an envelope are new elements not present in the original.

Therefore, allowed changes include:
- Artistic style transformation (semi-cartoon)
- Exaggeration of clothing (tuxedo and fur jacket)
- Simplification of background logos into linear patterns
- Addition of decorative framing and envelope context

**Allowed Changes List:**
(Semi-cartoon artistic style of the couple)
(Exaggerated silhouette of the man’s tuxedo)
(Exaggerated volume or texture of the woman’s fur jacket)
(Simplification of the FIA Prize Giving logo into linear motifs)
(Addition of a gold ribbon-like border)
(Presentation on a blue envelope with embossed logo pattern)

**Step 2 – Determine the Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
We now identify elements that must remain unchanged based on exclusion from the allowed changes list and core recognition logic:

**Core recognition elements:**
- The **identity of the individuals** (man and woman) must be preserved despite cartoonization. Their **relative positioning** (side-by-side), **posture** (standing upright, facing forward), and **basic facial structure** must remain recognizable.
- The **event identity** is crucial: the **FIA Prize Giving 2013 Paris** branding must be retained in some form because it defines the context of the image. Even if simplified, the **core emblem** (circular logo with radiating lines and "FIA" text) must remain identifiable.
- The **red carpet** is a key contextual element indicating the formal nature of the event; its presence as a floor surface must be maintained, even if stylized.
- The **black tuxedo** and **black evening gown** are essential for identifying the formal attire appropriate to the occasion. While their shape can be exaggerated, their **color** and **function** (formal wear) must remain intact.
- The **fur jacket** is a distinctive accessory; while its volume may be exaggerated, its **material appearance** (as a luxurious outer layer) and **position** (on the woman’s shoulders) must be preserved.

**Functional/logical association elements:**
- The **couple’s physical proximity** and **joint pose** (standing together, facing forward) reflect their shared participation in the event — changing this would disrupt the narrative of attendance and partnership.
- The **woman’s clutch** and **earrings** are accessories that contribute to her formal look and personal identity; they should be retained even if stylized.
- The **logo arrangement** on the backdrop is not arbitrary — it identifies the sponsors and event. Although simplified, the **presence of the FIA logo** and **sponsor names** (PHILIPS, VOLKSWAGEN, MICHELIN) must remain identifiable to preserve the event’s authenticity.

**Non-modified element deduction:**
After excluding allowed changes (style, exaggeration, framing), the following visual elements must be retained:
- The **distinctive shape of the FIA Prize Giving logo** (circular with radiating lines and "FIA" inside)
- The **text “PRIZE GIVING 2013 PARIS”** within the logo
- The **presence of the red carpet** as a base surface
- The **black color of the tuxedo and gown**
- The **woman’s fur jacket** as a separate garment layered over the dress
- The **man’s bow tie** and **white shirt collar**
- The **woman’s earrings and clutch** as accessories
- The **relative position of the two figures** (side-by-side, no overlap)

These are not explicitly mentioned as changeable, and altering them would compromise recognition of the original scene.

**Preservation Targets List:**
(The presence and circular shape of the FIA Prize Giving logo)
(The text "PRIZE GIVING 2013 PARIS" within the logo)
(The red carpet as the ground surface)
(The black color of the man’s tuxedo and the woman’s gown)
(The woman’s fur jacket as a distinct garment worn over the dress)
(The man’s bow tie and white shirt collar)
(The woman’s earrings and clutch)
(The side-by-side positioning of the man and woman)

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

Q1:  
Thinking process: The circular emblem with radiating lines and the text "FIA" is the core visual identifier of the event. Its unique shape and layout distinguish it from other logos. Even in a stylized version, the circular form with internal "FIA" text and outward lines must be preserved to maintain event identity. This is a key recognition feature; loss would make the image unidentifiable as related to the FIA Prize Giving. Thus, it receives a weight of 3 points.  
Question: Is the circular logo containing the text "FIA" and radiating lines present in the image?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The text "PRIZE GIVING 2013 PARIS" is part of the official branding of the event and appears directly within the logo. It is essential for temporal and locational identification. Removing or distorting it would misrepresent the event year and location. This is a critical functional detail tied to the event's identity, so it must be preserved. Weight: 3.  
Question: Is the text "PRIZE GIVING 2013 PARIS" visible within the central logo?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The red carpet is a defining environmental element of the red-carpet event. Its color and function as a stage surface are iconic. Even if stylized, its presence as a red floor beneath the subjects must be retained to maintain the scene’s authenticity. Without it, the setting loses its ceremonial context. This is a key scene element. Weight: 3.  
Question: Is a red carpet visible beneath the feet of the man and woman?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The man’s black tuxedo is a formal attire indicator. Its black color and structured form are essential for recognizing the occasion. While the style may be exaggerated, the color and basic silhouette must remain consistent. Changing the color would alter the visual identity of the subject’s role. Weight: 2.  
Question: Is the man wearing a black tuxedo?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The woman’s black evening gown is a core component of her formal appearance. Its color and flow are essential to her identity in the scene. While the fur jacket may be exaggerated, the gown itself must retain its black color and full-length form to preserve visual coherence. Weight: 2.  
Question: Is the woman wearing a black full-length evening gown?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The fur jacket is a distinctive accessory that adds luxury to the woman’s outfit. Its presence over the gown and its texture (implied by material) are key details. Even if exaggerated, it must remain as a separate layer on her shoulders. Losing it would remove a signature element of her style. Weight: 2.  
Question: Is a fur jacket worn over the woman’s dress?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The man’s bow tie and white shirt collar are standard components of a tuxedo. They define the formality of his attire. Even in semi-cartoon style, these elements must be recognizable. Their absence would make the outfit appear informal or incorrect. Weight: 1.  
Question: Does the man have a black bow tie and white shirt collar visible?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q8:  
Thinking process: The woman’s earrings and clutch are personal accessories that complete her formal look. While small, they are visually distinct and contribute to her identity. Their retention ensures continuity in her portrayal. Even if simplified, they must be present. Weight: 1.  
Question: Are earrings visible on the woman’s ears and a clutch held in her left hand?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q9:  
Thinking process: The side-by-side positioning of the man and woman establishes their relationship and joint presence at the event. Any significant shift in their relative positions (e.g., one behind the other) would alter the narrative. This spatial logic must be preserved. Weight: 2.  
Question: Are the man and woman standing side by side, facing forward?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2
