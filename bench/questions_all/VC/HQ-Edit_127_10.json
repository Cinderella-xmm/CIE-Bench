      "thinking_process": "The wrought-iron lattice structure is the defining architectural feature of the Eiffel Tower. It consists of crisscrossing metal beams forming a complex grid pattern. If this texture is lost or replaced with solid surfaces, the tower becomes unrecognizable. This is a core identity feature, hence weight 3.",

      "thinking_process": "The triangular base with four pillars is essential for structural recognition. Without this, the tower loses its iconic foundation shape. Even in a miniature format, this must be preserved to maintain identity. This is a core element, hence weight 3.",

      "thinking_process": "The three-tiered platform levels (visible as horizontal bands) are characteristic of the Eiffel Tower’s design. They mark the observation decks. Altering or removing them would distort the tower’s proportions. This is a structural detail critical to authenticity, hence weight 2.",
