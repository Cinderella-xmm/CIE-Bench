      "thinking_process": "The turquoise dome is the most iconic element of the structure, instantly recognizable due to its vibrant color, ribbed texture, and golden finial. Its presence and specific appearance are critical for identifying the building. Any loss of the dome's turquoise color or ribbed pattern would render the model unrecognizable as the original mosque. Therefore, preserving the dome’s visual characteristics is essential.",
      "question": "Is the turquoise-colored, ribbed dome with a golden finial present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The iwan’s ornate blue mosaic tilework is a defining feature of Timurid architecture. The instruction specifically mentions \"ornate arches\" and \"golden highlights,\" which directly refer to the iwan’s facade. The intricate patterns and color scheme are core to the building’s identity. Removing or altering this tilework would undermine the authenticity of the representation.",
      "question": "Are the blue mosaic tiles with floral and geometric patterns covering the iwan’s facade present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The minaret’s distinctive height and the patterned band near its top are unique identifiers. Although the instruction allows miniaturization, the minaret’s shape and decorative band must remain to preserve the architectural integrity. Losing this feature would distort the composition and reduce recognition.",
      "question": "Is the tall cylindrical minaret with a patterned band near the top visible in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The golden highlights are explicitly mentioned in the instruction as a required feature. These accents enhance the visual richness and are historically accurate for such structures. Their absence would result in a less authentic and visually incomplete model.",
      "question": "Are golden highlights present along the edges of the arches and dome in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The beige brick base is a consistent material feature across the structure and provides contrast to the blue tiles. It is a foundational element of the building’s appearance. While the instruction allows stylistic changes, the base color and material texture should be preserved to maintain visual coherence.",
      "question": "Is the beige brick construction of the lower walls and base visible in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The proportionality between the dome, iwan, and minaret is crucial for architectural accuracy. The dome should be centered above the iwan, and the minaret should be adjacent and vertically aligned. Disrupting this layout would create a misleading representation.",
      "question": "Is the dome positioned centrally behind the iwan, with the minaret to the left side of the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The ornate arches, particularly the pointed arch of the iwan, are structural and decorative hallmarks. Their presence defines the entrance and contributes to the overall aesthetic. Altering their shape or removing them would compromise the architectural style.",
      "question": "Are the pointed arches of the iwan and surrounding niches clearly visible in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
