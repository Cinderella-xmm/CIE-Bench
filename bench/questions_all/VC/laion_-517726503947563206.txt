**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a large, white multi-deck cruise ship named "Aurora," with the registration number "QV-8880" visible on its hull. The vessel features multiple levels with balconies, lifebuoys mounted along railings, decorative white balustrades, and several open-air decks equipped with white parasols. A red flag flies at the top of the ship’s mast. The ship is positioned centrally in the frame, floating on calm turquoise waters under a bright blue sky. In the background, there are karst limestone islands rising from the water, characteristic of Ha Long Bay. These islands are covered in green vegetation and have jagged, eroded rock formations. The horizon is clear, with minimal clouds, and the lighting suggests midday sunlight.

Thinking process:  
The editing instruction explicitly states to transform the cruise ship into a **grand, floating crystal palace**, using **translucent, iridescent crystals**, replacing the hull with **clear, angular structures and faceted domes**, reimagining windows as **multifaceted gems**, and decks as **intricate crystal paths**. It also specifies setting this craft against a **minimalist horizon**, ensuring contrast highlights the shimmering crystalline architecture.

From this, we can extract:

- **Subject transformation**: The cruise ship's form, material, and structure are to be completely replaced — allowed change.
- **Material replacement**: Hull → translucent crystal; windows → gem-like facets; decks → crystal paths — allowed change.
- **Scene modification**: Background is to be changed to a **minimalist horizon** — implies removal or simplification of the current landscape (karst islands, distant boats, etc.) — allowed change.
- **No mention of retention**: No element of the original ship’s identity (name, registration, flag, etc.) is required to remain — thus, all subject-specific details may be altered unless they are core identity markers.

Allowed Changes List:
- The shape and structure of the cruise ship
- The material composition of the hull, decks, and windows
- The color and texture of the ship’s exterior
- The presence and design of railings, balconies, and parasols
- The background environment (karst islands, water, sky)
- The overall lighting and atmosphere

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

Thinking process:  
We now determine what **must not be changed** based on the original image and the instructions. Since the instructions do **not** specify any retention of the original ship’s identity or scene, we must rely on **core recognition elements** and **functional/logical consistency** derived from the original image.

However, note that **no part of the original subject or scene is explicitly preserved** in the instruction. Therefore, only those elements that are **visually inseparable from the original object’s identity** or **logically necessary for coherence** should be retained — but only if they are **not overridden** by the transformation.

But here is a critical point: the **original image contains specific visual identifiers** such as:
- The **ship name "Aurora"**
- The **registration number "QV-8880"**
- The **red flag at the top of the mast**
- The **white parasols on the deck**
- The **lifebuoys along the railings**
- The **position and orientation of the ship** (side profile, facing right)

Even though the instruction says to transform the ship into a crystal palace, it does **not** say to erase all identity markers. However, since the transformation involves replacing the hull and structure entirely, these **textual and symbolic identifiers** may be lost unless specifically preserved.

But the instruction says “reimagine” — which allows for artistic reinterpretation. However, **in professional image consistency assessment**, if an element is **not mentioned for replacement**, and it is a **core identifier**, it should be **preserved** unless logically incompatible.

Yet, in this case, the **entire form is being transformed**, so even the **name and number** would need to be **replaced or integrated** into the new design (e.g., etched into crystal). But the instruction does **not** require them to be retained.

Therefore, **none of the original subject’s identifying features are required to be preserved**, because the instruction allows full transformation.

However, **the position and orientation of the ship** (side profile, facing right) and **its general scale relative to the environment** are implied by the instruction to be maintained in terms of **spatial logic** — i.e., the ship remains a central floating object. But since the background is to be simplified, the **relative size and placement** may still be preserved.

But again, the instruction says "set this dazzling craft against a minimalist horizon", meaning the **background is changed**, so **the karst islands and other boats must be removed or replaced**.

Thus, the only elements that **must be retained** are those that are **not mentioned for change**, but are **necessary for logical coherence** — but in this case, **everything is allowed to change**.

Wait — reconsider: **Is there any element that cannot be changed due to functional or iconic necessity?**

Let’s assess:

- **Core recognition elements**: The ship is identifiable by its **form**, **name**, **flag**, and **structure**. But since it is being transformed into a crystal palace, its **form is being changed**, so **the original form is not required to be retained**.
- **Functional elements**: The ship has decks, railings, lifebuoys — these are **functional**. But the instruction replaces them with crystal paths and gem windows, so **they are not required to be preserved**.
- **Scene logic**: The ship floats on water. The instruction says it floats, so **floating state is preserved** — but **water surface may be altered**.

But the instruction says **"set this dazzling craft against a minimalist horizon"**, which implies **removal of complex background elements** like karst islands.

So, **nothing is required to be preserved** except the **basic fact** that it is a **floating vessel**, and the **general spatial relationship** (it is centered, on water).

But in professional assessment, we must identify **what actually exists in the original image** and whether it must be preserved.

After careful analysis:

- The **original ship’s identity** (name, number, flag) is **not required to be preserved**.
- The **original materials** (white paint, metal railings) are **to be replaced**.
- The **original background** (karst islands, boats) is **to be replaced** with a minimalist horizon.

Therefore, **no element of the original image is required to be preserved**, because the instruction allows **complete transformation** of both subject and scene.

But wait — **is the ship’s orientation preserved?** The instruction doesn’t say to rotate it. So **orientation** (side profile, facing right) might be preserved for continuity.

Similarly, **the act of floating** is implied.

But these are **not visual elements** — they are **spatial properties**.

So, the **only elements that must be preserved** are those that are **not mentioned for change**, but are **essential for identity or function**.

However, in this case, **all elements are allowed to change**, so **no specific visual feature is required to be preserved**.

But this contradicts the purpose of the task — to detect **retention of edited elements**.

Therefore, we must infer that **some elements are implicitly preserved** due to their **core identity role**.

For example:
- The **name "Aurora"** is a key identifier of the ship.
- The **flag** is a national symbol.
- The **presence of the ship as a central object** is essential.

But the instruction says to **transform** the ship, so these **can be changed**.

Hence, **no element is strictly required to be preserved**.

But in practice, **professional consistency assessment** assumes that **core identity features** are preserved unless explicitly changed.

So, let’s assume that **the name "Aurora" and registration "QV-8880"** are **core identity markers**, and **should be retained**, even if stylized.

Similarly, the **red flag** is a **national identifier**, and may be preserved in form or meaning.

But the instruction says to replace the hull with crystal — so the **flag may be moved or redesigned**.

Given the ambiguity, we proceed with the principle: **only elements that are not mentioned for change and are essential for identity or logic should be preserved**.

Final decision: **No element is required to be preserved**, because the instruction allows full transformation.

But this leads to zero preservation targets — which is not useful.

Alternative interpretation: The instruction says “transform the cruise ship into a grand, floating crystal palace”, implying that the **ship’s identity is retained**, but **form is changed**. So the **name and flag** may still be present, just rendered in crystal.

Thus, **the name "Aurora" and registration "QV-8880"** are **core identity elements** and **should be retained**, even if stylized.

Similarly, the **red flag** is a **national identifier** and should be **retained in form or color**.

Also, the **ship’s orientation (side profile)** and **floating state** are **functional/logical elements** and should be preserved.

And the **presence of the ship as a central object** is essential.

But the **background** is to be changed to minimalist — so **karst islands, boats, and distant landforms must be removed or simplified**.

Therefore, the **only elements that should be preserved** are:

- The **name "Aurora"** on the hull
- The **registration "QV-8880"** on the hull
- The **red flag** at the top
- The **side profile orientation** of the ship
- The **floating state** (on water)
- The **central positioning** in the frame

These are **not mentioned for change**, and are **core to identity and logic**.

Preservation Targets List:
- The text "Aurora" on the side of the ship
- The text "QV-8880" on the hull
- The red flag flying at the top of the mast
- The ship’s side profile orientation (facing right)
- The ship’s floating position on water
- The central placement of the ship in the image

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The name "Aurora" is a core identity marker of the cruise ship, visible on the hull in the original image. Even if the ship is transformed into a crystal palace, retaining the name ensures the identity of the vessel is preserved. Its absence would make the ship unrecognizable as the original Aurora. This is a key identifier, hence weight 3 points.
    Question: Is the text "Aurora" visible on the side of the ship?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The registration number "QV-8880" is a unique identifier of the ship, located on the hull. It is a legal and operational detail that distinguishes this vessel from others. Losing it would compromise the authenticity of the ship’s identity. Though the instruction allows transformation, such identifiers are typically preserved in stylized versions. Thus, it is a core identity element, weight 3 points.
    Question: Is the registration number "QV-8880" visible on the hull of the ship?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The red flag at the top of the mast is a national symbol, likely the Vietnamese flag, indicating the ship’s origin. It is a prominent feature in the original image and contributes to the ship’s identity. While the instruction allows changes, national symbols are often retained in transformations for authenticity. Its presence is crucial for cultural and identity recognition, hence weight 3 points.
    Question: Is a red flag visible at the top of the ship’s mast?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The ship is shown in a side profile, facing to the right, which is a standard view for maritime photography. Changing the orientation would alter the viewer’s perception of the vessel’s design and symmetry. Since the instruction does not specify a change in angle, preserving the side profile maintains spatial consistency. This is a functional/logical element affecting layout, weight 2 points.
    Question: Is the ship oriented in a side profile view, facing toward the right side of the image?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The ship is floating on water, which is essential for its function and context. The instruction mentions it as a "floating crystal palace," so the floating state is preserved. The water surface may be altered, but the ship must remain on a liquid surface. This is a functional requirement, weight 2 points.
    Question: Is the ship depicted as floating on a body of water?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The ship is centrally positioned in the frame, which is a compositional choice emphasizing its importance. While the background is to be simplified, the ship’s central placement helps maintain visual balance. This is a minor but important compositional element, weight 1 point.
    Question: Is the ship positioned near the center of the image?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
