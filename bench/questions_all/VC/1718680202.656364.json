      "thinking_process": "The capybara is shown drinking from a glass with a straw and orange slice. The act of holding the drink is central to the scene’s narrative.

      "thinking_process": "The gray sleeveless sweater with a blue horizontal stripe defines the capybara’s attire. The sweater’s form and color pattern are unique to the character’s outfit. Altering these would change the visual identity. This is a key clothing detail, hence weight 2.",

      "thinking_process": "The capybara is positioned in profile facing left, with the head slightly turned toward the viewer.
