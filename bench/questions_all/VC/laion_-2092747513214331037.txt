**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a cyclist in an aerodynamic time trial position, wearing a full-body blue cycling suit with matching helmet, riding a road bike on a paved road. The cyclist is leaning forward with hands gripping the aerobars, positioned on the right side of the frame. A black sedan, likely a support vehicle, is to the left of the cyclist, driving parallel on the same road. The car has a roof rack carrying two bicycles mounted vertically. The license plate reads "BOC-480," and the car features decals including "303" on the hood. The road is marked with white lane lines and a yellow center line, with a single orange traffic cone visible in the background. The environment is arid with dry hills and sparse vegetation under bright daylight conditions. Text overlay at the top reads “12 WEEK PLAN” and “40K TIME TRIAL” in bold white font on a dark banner.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instructions specify transforming the image into a futuristic racing theme titled “Turbocharged Trial Tactics.” Key changes include:
- **Style**: Apply sleek metallic textures to both cyclist and car.
- **Color**: Add electric blue neon highlights and glow lines along the road edges.
- **Details**: Augment cyclist with transparent visor data displays (digitized enhancements).
- **Objects**: Project holographic cycling stats near the car.
- **Narrative**: Present as a high-tech future advertisement.

These modifications are clearly **transformative**, involving stylistic overhaul, color enhancement, digital augmentation, and addition of new elements (holograms, data displays). However, they do not explicitly state removal or alteration of the core **identity** of the subjects (cyclist, car, road) or their **spatial relationship** (parallel motion on the road). The instructions imply that the **scene structure and subject presence** should remain recognizable, even if stylized.

Therefore, **allowed changes** include:
- Surface textures (e.g., adding metallic sheen)
- Color overlays (electric blue neon)
- Digital enhancements (transparent visor, data displays)
- Holographic projections
- Glow effects on roads
- Visual style transformation (futuristic aesthetic)

**Allowed Changes List:**
- Metallic texture application to cyclist and car
- Electric blue neon highlights on cyclist and car
- Glow lines on both edges of the road
- Transparent visor data display on cyclist’s helmet
- Holographic cycling stats projected near the car
- Futuristic visual styling (overall tone and atmosphere)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
To preserve identity and logical coherence, we must identify what cannot be altered without losing recognition or narrative integrity.

**Core recognition elements:**  
- The **cyclist’s posture** (aerodynamic tuck, hands on aerobars) is essential for identifying this as a time trial scene. Changing it would misrepresent the event type.
- The **support car with roof-mounted bikes** is iconic in professional cycling and identifies the context as a race with team support. Removing or altering its form would break realism.
- The **road layout** (white lane markings, yellow center line, orange cone) establishes the setting as a controlled course — critical for contextual consistency.
- The **license plate "BOC-480"** is a specific identifier; while minor, its retention supports authenticity unless replaced by a fictional one (which is not stated).
- The **positioning** of cyclist relative to car (parallel, slightly behind) maintains logical pursuit dynamics.

**Functional/logical association elements:**  
- The **car following the cyclist** implies support role; reversing or distorting this spatial relationship would violate functional logic.
- The **bicycles mounted on the car roof** are functionally tied to the cycling context — removing them would make the car appear unrelated.
- The **cyclist's interaction with the bike** (hands on bars, feet on pedals) must remain intact to convey active riding.

**Non-modified element deduction:**  
After excluding allowed changes (texture, color, glow, holograms), the following must remain:
- Cyclist’s body shape and posture
- Car’s model and mounting of bikes
- Road surface and lane markings
- Position of cyclist and car
- Presence of cone and natural terrain

Even though style can change, the **core forms** must stay to maintain referential accuracy.

**Preservation Targets List:**
- Cyclist’s aerodynamic posture (leaning forward, hands on aerobars)
- Support car with roof-mounted bicycles
- Road surface with white and yellow lane markings
- Orange traffic cone in background
- Relative positioning of cyclist and car (parallel, adjacent lanes)
- License plate reading "BOC-480"
- Natural arid landscape in background

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The cyclist's aerodynamic posture—specifically leaning forward with hands gripping the aerobars—is the defining action of a time trial rider. This pose is essential for identifying the activity as a time trial rather than a casual ride or sprint. Altering it would fundamentally misrepresent the scene. It is a core identification feature, hence weighted 3 points.
    Question: Is the cyclist in a forward-leaning position with hands on aerobars?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The support car with two bicycles mounted vertically on the roof rack is a distinctive feature indicating team support in competitive cycling. Its presence defines the context of professional racing. Removing or changing this configuration would disrupt the narrative logic of the scene. This is a key functional element, thus weighted 3 points.
    Question: Are two bicycles mounted vertically on the roof rack of the black car?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The road markings—white edge lines and yellow center line—are essential for establishing the setting as a structured roadway suitable for a time trial. Their absence or distortion would make the location ambiguous. While color may be enhanced, their structural presence must remain. This is an important scene element, so weighted 2 points.
    Question: Are there white lane markings and a yellow center line on the road?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The orange traffic cone in the background serves as a visual cue for course demarcation, reinforcing the idea of a controlled race environment. Though small, its presence contributes to scene logic. It is not central but helps maintain environmental coherence. Therefore, it is a secondary detail, weighted 1 point.
    Question: Is there an orange traffic cone visible in the background near the cyclist?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}

{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The license plate "BOC-480" is a specific identifier on the car. While not visually dominant, it provides authenticity and anchors the image to reality. Replacing it without reason would reduce fidelity. As a minor but verifiable detail, it is retained unless explicitly changed. Thus, it is a detail-level element, weighted 1 point.
    Question: Does the car have a license plate reading "BOC-480"?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}

{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The relative positioning of the cyclist and car—parallel, close proximity, with the car slightly ahead or alongside—establishes the dynamic of support during a race. Changing this could imply pursuit or obstruction, altering the intended narrative. This spatial relationship is crucial for logical consistency, making it a key scene element, weighted 2 points.
    Question: Is the cyclist riding parallel to the car on the same road?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The arid, hilly landscape with sparse vegetation provides environmental context for the location. While lighting and color may shift with the futuristic theme, the basic terrain shape and lack of greenery must remain to preserve geographical plausibility. This is a background feature contributing to scene coherence, so it is weighted 1 point.
    Question: Is the background composed of dry hills with sparse vegetation?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
