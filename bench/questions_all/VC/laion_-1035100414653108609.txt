**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a warthog standing in profile, facing right, positioned on a bed of dry straw or hay. The animal has a robust, barrel-shaped body with distinct dark vertical stripes running along its back and sides, which contrast against a lighter grayish-tan base fur color. It features prominent, upward-curving tusks—longer lower tusks that curve outward and upward, and shorter upper tusks that are more straight and slightly curved. The warthog has a coarse, bristly mane of dark hair running from the head down the back, and a thick, wrinkled snout with visible warts near the cheeks. Its eyes are small and dark, set within a broad face. The background is a muted, dark green-brown, suggesting an enclosed zoo habitat, possibly with shadowed walls or foliage. The ground is covered in pale yellow straw, and the lighting emphasizes the texture of the fur and tusks. At the top of the image, text reads: "NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK, WASHINGTON, D.C." At the bottom: "WART HOG" and "5A-H618".

Thinking process:  
The editing instruction explicitly transforms the warthog into a **whimsical forest elemental creature**, indicating that the **form, appearance, and biological identity** of the warthog can be fundamentally altered. The instruction specifies multiple changes:
- Replace **tusks** with **mossy tusks**
- Add **leaf-styled patterns** across the body
- Replace **mane** with **cascading waterfall-like textures**
- Add **fungi growth** along the back
- Change **eyes** to **luminous woodland pools**
- Transform **hooves** into **twisting branches**

These transformations directly target the **morphology, texture, and material qualities** of the warthog’s body parts. The instruction does not mention preserving any specific anatomical feature beyond the general shape (implied by “transform”), nor does it require retention of the scene.

However, **the scene elements** such as the **straw-covered ground**, **dark background**, **text labels**, and **overall composition** are not mentioned for modification. Since the instruction focuses only on transforming the **subject**, and does not state to alter the environment or textual content, we infer that these **non-subject elements** may be retained unless they conflict with the transformation.

Allowed Changes List:  
(Specific element 1 that allows for changes): The warthog's tusks — can be replaced with mossy structures  
(Specific element 2 that allows for changes): The warthog's mane — can be replaced with cascading waterfall textures  
(Specific element 3 that allows for changes): The warthog's skin pattern — can be overlaid with leaf-styled designs  
(Specific element 4 that allows for changes): The warthog's back — can have fungi growth added  
(Specific element 5 that allows for changes): The warthog's eyes — can be changed to glowing woodland pool-like features  
(Specific element 6 that allows for changes): The warthog's hooves — can be transformed into twisting branch forms  
(Specific element 7 that allows for changes): The overall biological form — can be stylized into a forest elemental  

Note: While the **subject's form** is being transformed, the **scene context** (straw, background, text) is not specified for change and thus may remain.

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements:  
- The **original subject** is a **warthog**, identifiable by its **distinctive tusks**, **striped body**, **warty face**, and **coarse mane**. However, since the instruction explicitly says to **transform** the warthog into a whimsical elemental creature, **its original biological identity is no longer required**. Therefore, **core recognition features** such as the **actual tusk shape**, **stripe pattern**, **mane**, etc., are **not required to be preserved** because they are **explicitly replaced**.

Functional/logical association elements:  
- There are no functional interactions (e.g., tools, mechanical parts) in this image. The warthog stands alone in a static pose. No action or interaction is described, so no functional logic needs preservation.
- The **position of the warthog** relative to the ground and background is not specified for change, but since the transformation is of the subject itself, and no spatial relationship is stated to be preserved, **spatial layout is allowed to shift**.

Non-modified element deduction:  
Even though the warthog’s **body parts** are to be modified, certain **scene elements** are **not mentioned** in the editing instructions and thus should be considered **retained** based on visual coherence and standard postcard conventions:
- The **text at the top**: "NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK, WASHINGTON, D.C." — this identifies the location and is likely part of the original postcard design; not mentioned for change, so must be preserved.
- The **text at the bottom**: "WART HOG" — this labels the subject and is critical for identification; although the subject is being transformed, the label remains relevant as a caption.
- The **straw-covered ground** — this is part of the environmental setting and provides context; unless contradicted by the whimsical transformation, it should remain.
- The **dark background** — serves as a neutral backdrop; unless the new elemental form requires a different environment, it should be retained.
- The **postcard format** — including white border and layout — is implied by the image and should be preserved as part of the medium.

Therefore, **only non-subject elements** (text, ground, background, framing) are **not allowed to change**, while the **subject’s anatomy** is fully transformable.

Preservation Targets List:  
(Element 1 that should be maintained): The text "NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK, WASHINGTON, D.C." at the top of the image  
(Element 2 that should be maintained): The text "WART HOG" at the bottom center of the image  
(Element 3 that should be maintained): The straw-covered ground beneath the warthog  
(Element 4 that should be maintained): The dark green-brown background behind the warthog  
(Element 5 that should be maintained): The white border framing the image  
(Element 6 that should be maintained): The identifier code "5A-H618" at the bottom right corner

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Retained Visual Elements**

Q1:  
Thinking process: The text "NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK, WASHINGTON, D.C." is a core identifying feature of the original postcard, anchoring the image to a specific institution and location. It is not mentioned in the editing instruction as something to be removed or altered, and its removal would sever the historical and contextual identity of the image. This is a key textual element that defines the image’s provenance and must be preserved. Loss of this text would make the image unrecognizable as originating from the National Zoological Park, hence it is a 3-point element.  
Question: Is the text "NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK, WASHINGTON, D.C." present at the top center of the image?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3

Q2:  
Thinking process: The label "WART HOG" directly identifies the subject before transformation. Although the subject is being reimagined, the caption remains essential for contextual continuity. Removing or altering this label would mislead viewers about the original subject, even if transformed. It is a key textual anchor and therefore carries high weight.  
Question: Is the text "WART HOG" present at the bottom center of the image?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3

Q3:  
Thinking process: The straw-covered ground is a defining environmental detail in the original image, providing a naturalistic setting for the animal. It is not mentioned in the editing instruction to be changed, and maintaining it ensures visual consistency between the original and edited versions. While whimsical elements could be layered over it, its presence as a textured ground layer is crucial for grounding the scene. This is a major environmental element, hence a 2-point question.  
Question: Is the ground beneath the warthog covered with dry, pale yellow straw?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2

Q4:  
Thinking process: The dark green-brown background serves as a neutral, shaded enclosure typical of zoo exhibits. It is not referenced in the editing instruction, and replacing it without cause would disrupt the original setting. While the whimsical creature might emit light, the background should remain consistent unless specified. This is a key scene element supporting realism and context.  
Question: Is the background behind the warthog a dark green-brown gradient, resembling an indoor or shaded enclosure?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2

Q5:  
Thinking process: The white border frames the entire image and is characteristic of vintage postcards. Its absence would change the medium and aesthetic. Though not central to subject identity, it is a structural element of the image format and must be preserved for authenticity. This is a minor but important detail.  
Question: Is there a white border surrounding the image, separating the artwork from the edges?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1

Q6:  
Thinking process: The code "5A-H618" is a cataloging identifier common in vintage postcards. It is not mentioned for change and is part of the original design. Its retention preserves archival integrity and helps trace the image’s origin. Though minor, it is a unique identifier and should be preserved.  
Question: Is the code "5A-H618" present in the bottom right corner of the image?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1
