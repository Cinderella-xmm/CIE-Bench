Description of reference image: The subject is a woman in traditional African attire, standing outside a thatched-roof mud hut with vibrant geometric patterns and beadwork. She wears a colorful headwrap, layered beaded necklaces, and a patterned dress with symbolic motifs, including circular and floral designs in orange, green, yellow, and red. Her posture is upright, leaning slightly on a wooden staff. A second identical figure appears inside the doorway, framed by a glowing blue neon border, suggesting a digital or futuristic portal. The hut features a small window with white curtains, a decorative wall panel with a world map rendered in digital grid lines, and a cracked earth exterior. In front of the hut are several cooking vessels: a large metal pot, a smaller bowl with colorful grains, and a ceramic cup. To the left, an elephant stands near a pile of hay under a clear sky with distant hills. The ground is reddish-brown dirt, typical of savanna terrain.

Thinking process:  
First, analyze the editing instructions: "Create a series of three art postcards featuring the woman in vibrant African attire: one with her leaning against a straw hut, another emphasizing her beaded jewelry in abstract form, and the third showcasing her silhouette against a digital grassy landscape. Use vivid colors and geometric borders for a cohesive set."  

Key changes allowed:
- The **form** of the woman can be altered (e.g., abstracted, silhouetted).
- The **scene** can be transformed (e.g., digital grassy landscape, abstract background).
- The **presentation** can vary across postcards (e.g., different compositions, styles).
- The **number of images** is increased to three distinct versions.
- The **background** is not required to remain consistent; it may be replaced entirely.

However, the instruction specifies that the **woman in vibrant African attire** must be featured — meaning her **core identity** as a traditionally dressed African woman must persist across all versions. This implies that while her form may be abstracted or silhouetted, her **distinctive cultural attire** must still be recognizable.

Specific elements explicitly mentioned in the instruction:
- "Vibrant African attire" → this is the core subject attribute, so **the clothing style and color scheme** must reflect African cultural aesthetics.
- "Beaded jewelry" → must appear in at least one version, even if abstracted.
- "Silhouette" → allows for loss of detail, but the **shape and posture** must suggest the original figure.
- "Straw hut" → appears in one postcard, so the **hut’s presence is optional**, but if included, its **basic form** should be retained.

Therefore, the **allowed changes** include:
- Replacing or modifying the background environment.
- Abstracting or stylizing the woman's form.
- Changing the composition or lighting.
- Removing or altering secondary objects (like pots, elephant).
- Using digital effects (neon glow, digital landscapes).

Allowed Changes List:
- Background scenery (e.g., savanna, hills, elephant)
- Presence and form of cooking vessels
- Lighting and atmospheric conditions
- Digital enhancements (neon frame, world map display)
- Composition and framing of each postcard
- Abstraction level of the woman (including silhouette or geometric forms)
- Number of figures (only one needed per postcard)

Step 2 – Determine the elements that should remain unchanged

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements:  
The woman’s **vibrant African attire** is central to the instruction. Even when abstracted, the **color palette**, **beaded jewelry**, **headwrap**, and **patterned dress** must retain their cultural identity. These are not just decorative — they are **iconic identifiers** of the subject’s cultural representation. If these are lost or replaced with non-African patterns, the subject becomes unrecognizable as intended.

Functional/logical association elements:  
The **relationship between the woman and her attire** is functional — the clothing defines her cultural identity. Even in abstract forms, the **structure of the garment** (e.g., wrap-style skirt, layered necklaces) must be preserved in shape or implication. Similarly, if the straw hut is included, its **thatched roof and mud walls** must maintain basic form to satisfy the “leaning against a straw hut” directive.

Non-modified element deduction:  
After excluding allowed changes, the following **must remain**:
- The **distinctive color scheme** of the clothing (orange, green, yellow, red).
- The **presence of beaded necklaces** (even if abstracted).
- The **headwrap** style (turban-like, colorful).
- The **patterned dress** with symbolic motifs (circular, floral, geometric).
- The **posture** of leaning (in the first postcard), which implies a physical stance.
- The **overall human form** of the woman (not replaced with animal or non-human figure).

Preservation Targets List:  
- The woman’s vibrant African attire with specific color palette and patterned design  
- The layered beaded necklaces around her neck  
- The turban-style headwrap with intricate color patterns  
- The wrap-style dress with symbolic motifs (circular, floral, geometric)  
- The posture of leaning on a staff (in the first postcard)  
- The presence of a straw hut with thatched roof and mud walls (if included)  
- The overall human form and gender presentation of the subject  

Q1:  
Thinking process: The woman’s attire, particularly the **colorful, patterned dress with symbolic motifs**, is the core identifier of her cultural identity. The specific combination of orange, green, yellow, and red with circular and floral designs is unique to the visual style of the original image. If these patterns are removed or replaced with unrelated designs, the cultural authenticity is lost, making the subject unrecognizable within the context of the instruction. This is a key identity feature, hence weight 3.  
Question: Does the edited image retain the patterned dress with circular and floral motifs in orange, green, yellow, and red?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The **layered beaded necklaces** are a signature accessory in the original image and are explicitly mentioned in the instruction (“emphasizing her beaded jewelry”). Even if abstracted, their **presence and layered structure** must be preserved to fulfill the artistic intent. Their removal would violate the core directive about highlighting jewelry. Thus, this is a critical element, assigned 3 points.  
Question: Are multiple layers of colorful beaded necklaces visible around the woman’s neck?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The **turban-style headwrap** with its distinctive multicolored pattern is a defining feature of the woman’s appearance. It is not merely decorative but part of the cultural attire. Its absence or replacement with a different head covering (e.g., hat, scarf) would alter the subject’s identity. Therefore, it must be preserved, even in stylized form. Weight: 3.  
Question: Is the woman wearing a turban-style headwrap with a multicolored, patterned design?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The **staff** she leans on is part of her posture and contributes to the narrative of strength and tradition. While the instruction allows abstraction, the **act of leaning** implies a physical support, and the staff is essential to that pose. Its removal would change the intended gesture and undermine the scene’s logic. This is a functional element tied to posture, thus weight 2.  
Question: Is the woman leaning on a wooden staff?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The **mud hut with thatched roof** is specified in the instruction for one postcard. While the background can be changed, if the hut is included, its **basic structure** — rounded mud walls and thatched roof — must be retained. Altering it into a modern building or removing it entirely would violate the directive. This is an important scene element, weight 2.  
Question: Is there a hut with a thatched roof and mud walls present in the image?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The **human form** of the woman is fundamental to the subject’s identity. Even if abstracted into silhouette or geometric shapes, the **overall shape of a standing woman** must be discernible. Replacing her with an animal or non-human figure would break the core premise. This is a core identity feature, weight 3.  
Question: Is the figure clearly a human woman in a standing position?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The **color palette** of the attire — especially the dominance of warm colors like orange, red, and yellow — is a hallmark of the original image and aligns with the instruction’s call for "vivid colors." If the colors are desaturated or replaced with cool tones, the visual impact and cultural representation are compromised. This is a key aesthetic feature, weight 2.  
Question: Are the dominant colors in the woman’s attire warm tones such as orange, red, and yellow?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2
