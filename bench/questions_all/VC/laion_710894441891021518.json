Since it is not mentioned in the editing instruction, it should remain unaltered. Removing it would disrupt the spatial logic and reduce visual coherence. This is a minor but identifiable detail, so it is assigned a weight of 1 point.",
      "question": "Is the white tea light candle present on the black surface to the left of the bonsai pot?",

The instruction does not mention changing the surface, so it must remain unchanged. Altering its color or texture would affect the overall balance and realism of the scene. This is a key environmental element, hence 2 points.",

Changing it could shift the mood or distract from the central figure. As a core scene element, it is vital for consistency and earns 2 points.",

While the instruction says it should become a stone base, its **position, size, and general shape** must be preserved for continuity. If it were moved or resized drastically, the edited image would lose its anchor. Thus, its **visual footprint** is critical. This is a core functional element, earning 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the bonsai planted in a wide, shallow, teal-colored ceramic pot that occupies the center of the image?",

Though the tree may become magical, the **soil layer** should remain visible and undisturbed unless explicitly replaced. This is a minor but important detail that supports authenticity. Weight: 1.",

      "thinking_process": "The bonsai’s **upright posture and centered composition** are fundamental to its visual identity in the original image. Even after transformation, the **spatial arrangement** should remain consistent to preserve the viewer’s sense of orientation. Moving or tilting the tree would break the original framing. This is a key compositional element, so it is worth 2 points.",
