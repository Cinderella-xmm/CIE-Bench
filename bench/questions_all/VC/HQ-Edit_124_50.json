      "thinking_process": "The red rose with green leaves at the center of the horse's flank is a core visual identifier of the folk-art style. It is the largest and most prominent floral motif, defining the design's symmetry and cultural origin. If lost or altered in shape or color, the object loses its recognizable identity. This is a key element that cannot be replaced without changing the essence of the subject.",
      "question": "Is the central red rose with green leaves clearly visible on the horse's flank?",

        "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The black bridle running along the horse's face is a distinctive feature that adds realism and contrast to the painted design. Its presence separates the painted area from the natural wood face and is consistent across similar folk sculptures. Removing or altering it would disrupt the visual balance and identification of the horse.",
      "question": "Is the black bridle visible along the horse's face and jawline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The dark tail is a critical anatomical detail that completes the horse's silhouette. Its position and color contrast with the painted body, making it a necessary part of the animal’s form. Even in a fragmented puzzle version, the tail must remain identifiable.",
      "question": "Is the dark tail extending from the rear of the horse?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The natural wood texture on the legs and face provides a foundational contrast to the painted areas and is characteristic of hand-carved wooden horses. This texture defines the materiality of the object and must remain visible to preserve authenticity.",
      "question": "Are the horse's legs and facial area rendered in natural wood grain texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The symmetrical arrangement of red roses and blue flowers on both sides of the horse is a hallmark of the design. This pattern is not arbitrary but culturally significant. Altering the placement or number of roses would break the intended aesthetic.",
      "question": "Are red roses symmetrically placed on both flanks of the horse?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The warm ambient lighting, particularly the glow from the lantern and chandelier, establishes the cozy cabin atmosphere. While the light source may change, the overall warm tone and soft illumination must be preserved to maintain scene consistency.",
      "question": "Is the scene illuminated with warm, golden light creating soft shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The log cabin background, including visible horizontal logs and a stone fireplace with stacked firewood, grounds the scene in a specific rustic setting. This environmental context is essential to the image’s narrative and must remain visually present.",
      "question": "Are horizontal wooden logs and a stone fireplace with stacked firewood visible in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q8",
      "thinking_process": "The horse's profile orientation (facing right) is a fixed compositional choice that defines its stance. Reversing or rotating it would change the viewer’s perception and disrupt the original framing.",
      "question": "Is the horse positioned in profile, facing toward the right side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
