### Step 1 - Allowed Changes List:

Thinking process: The instructions specify combining the car’s front, left side, and rear views. This means altering the composition to a multi-view format while retaining the car's identity. Scene elements like the house, driveway, and landscape can be removed or replaced since the focus is solely on the car. The angles and perspectives of the car can be adjusted for a composite view.

Allowed Changes List:
1. Composition adjustment to include multiple car views (front, left side, rear).
2. Removal or replacement of the background scene (house, driveway, trees).
3. Adjustments to lighting and shadows to match a unified look for the car in different views.

### Step 2 - Determination of Elements That Should Remain Unchanged:

Thinking process: Elements critical for recognizing the Ford Mustang, such as its distinct grille design, headlights, and color, must be retained. Functional elements like wheel structure and body shape are essential to maintain the logical consistency of a car. Remaining visual coherence demands keeping details like the emblem placement, grille texture, and wheel design consistent across views.

Preservation Targets List:
1. The red paint finish and its unique shine.
2. The signature front grille design with the Ford emblem.
3. The LED daytime running lights and their configuration.
4. The specific shape and details of the alloy wheels.
5. The car's overall body shape and proportions.
