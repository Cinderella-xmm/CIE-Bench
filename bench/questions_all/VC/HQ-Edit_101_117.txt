**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a metallic mannequin displayed in a full-length pose, draped in an opulent maroon saree with intricate gold and multicolored embroidery featuring floral and paisley motifs. The saree has a richly detailed border with symmetrical patterns, and the pallu is draped over the left shoulder, extending to the floor. The blouse is strapless, matching the saree’s color and embellishment style. The mannequin wears elaborate jewelry: a multi-layered choker necklace with dangling elements, a matching bracelet on the right wrist, and a ring on the right hand. The posture is upright and poised, with the right hand slightly bent and resting near the hip, and the left arm extended forward with the palm open. The background is a neutral gradient beige tone, softly lit to highlight the textures of the fabric and jewelry. There are no other objects or figures in the scene.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction explicitly states:  
- Transform the *mannequin* into an *ancient Indian stone sculpture*.  
- Carve *delicate floral and paisley motifs* into the stone—this implies the *designs must be preserved*, but now as carved relief rather than embroidered.  
- Depict the mannequin's form in a *stylized, serene pose typical of classical Indian sculptures*—so the *posture can change* to match classical styles (e.g., lotus position, closed eyes, hands in mudra), but *the essence of the figure’s orientation and elegance should remain*.  
- Maintain the *regal jewelry’s essence as ornate carved details*—so the *form and placement* of the jewelry must be retained, but transformed into *stone carving*.  
- The stone must have a *weathered, historical texture*—so material changes are allowed, but the *texture quality* (aged, eroded, patina) must be preserved.  

From this, we infer:  
- **Subject transformation**: The mannequin is replaced by a stone sculpture → the *physical form* of the mannequin is changed.  
- **Material transformation**: Fabric → carved stone; jewelry → carved stone details.  
- **Posture**: Can be adjusted to a classical Indian sculptural pose (e.g., meditative stance), but the *overall silhouette and grace* should be maintained.  
- **Designs**: The *floral and paisley motifs* must be preserved as carved reliefs.  
- **Jewelry**: Must remain in *same positions and forms*, but rendered as stone carvings.  
- **Background**: Not mentioned for retention → allowed to change.  
- **Color palette**: Not specified to retain → can shift from rich red/gold to stone tones (ochre, gray, brown).  
- **Texture**: The *embroidery pattern* must be preserved in form, but now as *carved depth*; the *jewelry’s structure* must remain visible in stone.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
- The physical form of the mannequin (metallic → stone)  
- The material of the saree and jewelry (fabric/jewel → carved stone)  
- The posture (can adopt classical Indian sculptural poses like seated or standing in meditation)  
- The background (can be altered to resemble an ancient temple setting or plain aged stone wall)  
- The color scheme (can shift to earthy stone tones)  
- The lighting (can be adjusted to emphasize depth and texture of stone)  
- The overall surface finish (from smooth metallic to weathered, cracked stone)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
We now identify what **must not change**, based on exclusion and logical necessity:

1. **Core recognition elements**:  
   - The **floral and paisley motifs** are central to the identity of the original saree. These are not just decorative—they define the cultural and aesthetic context. Even if transformed into stone carvings, their **presence, layout, and design** must be preserved.  
   - The **structure of the saree drape**—how it folds, the pallu over the shoulder, the pleats at the front—is essential to recognizing it as a saree. This drape pattern is iconic in Indian attire and must be preserved in form, even if material changes.  
   - The **position and form of the jewelry** (choker, bracelet, ring) are critical. Though they become carved stone, their **placement on the neck, wrist, and hand** must remain unchanged to preserve the regal aesthetic and visual logic.  
   - The **pose of the figure**—while posture may shift to a classical style, the **general orientation** (standing, facing forward, one hand raised) must be retained to maintain continuity with the original composition.

2. **Functional/logical association elements**:  
   - The **relationship between the jewelry and the body** must remain: the choker rests on the neck, the bracelet on the wrist, the ring on the finger. Changing these would break the logical connection between adornment and anatomy.  
   - The **flow of the saree** must follow the same path: from the shoulder, across the torso, down the leg, with pleats at the front and pallu trailing behind. This spatial logic is essential to the garment’s identity.

3. **Non-modified element deduction**:  
   - The **specific arrangement of embroidery**—clusters of flowers, leaves, and paisleys—must be preserved in the stone carving.  
   - The **border design** of the saree, especially its width and pattern, must remain consistent.  
   - The **proportions of the figure**—though stylized, the relative size of head, torso, limbs—should be maintained to avoid distortion.  
   - The **hand position**—right hand near hip, left hand forward—must be retained in some form to preserve the original gesture.

Thus, while **material, color, and posture** can change, the **core visual structure, pattern layout, and anatomical relationships** must remain intact.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
- The floral and paisley embroidery patterns on the saree  
- The drape and fold structure of the saree (pallu over shoulder, pleats at front)  
- The position and form of the choker necklace on the neck  
- The position and form of the bracelet on the right wrist  
- The position and form of the ring on the right hand  
- The general silhouette and proportions of the figure  
- The spatial relationship between the saree and the body (how it drapes over the torso and legs)  
- The border design of the saree (width, pattern, and placement)

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The floral and paisley motifs are the defining decorative elements of the saree, directly tied to its cultural and aesthetic identity. Their presence, arrangement, and symmetry are key to recognizing the garment as a traditional Indian bridal or ceremonial saree. Even when transformed into stone carvings, their exact design must be preserved to maintain authenticity. Losing these patterns would result in a loss of cultural specificity and visual coherence. Thus, this is a core identity element.
    Question: Are the floral and paisley embroidery patterns present and accurately replicated as carved reliefs on the saree?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The drape of the saree—especially the pallu over the left shoulder and the pleats at the front—is a structural hallmark of how the garment is worn. It defines the silhouette and distinguishes it from other garments. Even if rendered in stone, the way the fabric flows over the body must be preserved to maintain the garment's identity. Altering this drape would fundamentally change the subject’s appearance and recognition.
    Question: Is the saree draped with the pallu over the left shoulder and the pleats aligned vertically at the front?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The choker necklace is a prominent accessory that contributes to the regal appearance of the figure. Its placement on the neck and its layered, ornate structure are visually distinct. Even as a carved detail, its position and form must be preserved to maintain the sense of adornment and cultural significance. Removing or relocating it would disrupt the balance and symbolism of the attire.
    Question: Is the multi-layered choker necklace positioned around the neck, with dangling elements visible?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The bracelet on the right wrist is a key accessory that complements the choker and reinforces the theme of royal adornment. Its placement on the wrist is fixed and functional in the original image. In the stone version, it must remain in the same location and retain its ornate shape to preserve the visual logic of the jewelry set.
    Question: Is the bracelet present on the right wrist, matching the design and placement of the original?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The ring on the right hand is a small but significant detail that completes the jewelry ensemble. Its presence on the index finger is specific and contributes to the overall elegance. Even in stone, its position must be preserved to maintain consistency with the original pose and adornment logic.
    Question: Is the ring present on the right hand, specifically on the index finger?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The border of the saree features a distinct pattern and width that frames the garment. This border is a signature element of high-end sarees and must be preserved in both position and design. In the stone version, it should appear as a carved edge along the pallu and lower hem.
    Question: Is the wide, patterned border of the saree preserved along the edges of the pallu and hem?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The overall silhouette of the figure—its upright stance, proportionate limbs, and balanced posture—is essential to maintaining the dignity and elegance of the original mannequin. While the pose may shift to a classical Indian style, the general human form and proportions must remain consistent to ensure the subject remains recognizable as a human figure in formal attire.
    Question: Does the figure maintain a standing, upright posture with proportional limbs and a balanced silhouette?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
