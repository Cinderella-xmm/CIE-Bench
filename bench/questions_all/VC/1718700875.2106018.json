      "thinking_process": "The dark brown eyes are a core identification feature of the poodle in the original image. They provide contrast against the white fur and contribute significantly to the animal’s expression and species recognition. If the eye color were changed (e.g., to blue or green), the subject would lose its authentic appearance and become unrecognizable as the same poodle. This is a key visual identifier and thus carries high weight.",

      "thinking_process": "The white, curly fur in the poodle cut is a defining characteristic of the breed and the grooming style in the image. The volume and shape of the head and ear tufts are iconic. Changing the fur color or removing the curls would fundamentally alter the subject’s identity. Thus, this is a core visual feature.",

Its intricate design and position on the chest are key to the visual narrative. Moving or simplifying it would diminish the authenticity of the attire. Thus, it is an important accessory element.",
