Description of reference image: The subject is a pair of black parking meters situated on a sidewalk. The parking meter on the left displays a mechanical timer, numbered "20487." The parking meter on the right has a digital display labeled "1995" and the text "OUSTORIC." Both meters have slots for coins and small labels with numerical codes. The background includes a city street scene with cars, trees, and buildings.

Thinking process:  
The editing instructions specify changing the timer on the left meter into a robotic dog holding a coin while retaining billing functionality. This primarily involves altering the appearance of the timer, not the overall structure or other functionalities of the meter. Therefore, the scene, the general shape of the parking meter, and the right meter should remain unchanged. 

Allowed Changes List:  
Specific element 1 that allows for changes - The mechanical timer face on the left meter can be changed to a robotic dog holding a coin.  
Specific element 2 that allows for changes - The specific design elements of the timer face can be modified, including the numbers and markings.

### Step 2 - Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements: The general shape, color, and functionality of the parking meters and their placement on the sidewalk are critical elements that establish the scene's context. The right meter should remain unchanged, as it hasn’t been specified for alteration.  
Functional/logical association elements: The slot for inserting coins and the bill/payment mechanism should still be visible and functional on both meters to maintain logical consistency.  
Non-modified elements: The surrounding sidewalk, street, and background elements, such as the cars, trees, and buildings, should stay consistent with the original image.

Preservation Targets List:  
(Element 1 that should be maintained - The general shape and color of the parking meters)  
(Element 2 that should be maintained - The coin slot and payment mechanism of both parking meters)  
(Element 3 that should be maintained - The right parking meter’s display and label)  
(Element 4 that should be maintained - The background and street scene)

    Q1:
    Thinking process: The parking meter's general shape and color are key visual elements for recognizing it as a parking meter. Removing or altering these features would make the object unrecognizable.
    Question: Does the parking meter maintain its black cylindrical shape and color?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

{
    Q2:
    Thinking process: The coin slot and payment mechanism are essential for the parking meter's functionality. Their presence ensures that the billing function is retained as per the instructions.
    Question: Is the coin slot visible on both parking meters?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2

{
    Q3:
    Thinking process: The right parking meter has not been instructed to change, so its digital display and label should remain intact. This is crucial for maintaining scene consistency.
    Question: Is the digital display on the right parking meter unchanged and labeled "1995"?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q4:
    Thinking process: The street and sidewalk provide the necessary context for the parking meters. Their consistency helps maintain visual coherence.
    Question: Is the scene background, including the sidewalk, street, cars, and buildings, consistent with the original?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1

{
    Q5:
    Thinking process: The numbers and labels on the parking meters contribute to their identity. While the timer on the left is changed, its corresponding numbers should logically adjust to accommodate the new form while retaining its meaning.
    Question: Are the numbers on the left meter ("20487") still present in some form, like being part of the robotic dog's design?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
