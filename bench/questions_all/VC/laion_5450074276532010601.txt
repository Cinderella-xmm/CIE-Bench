Description of reference image: The subject is a table tennis set housed in an open, rectangular cardboard box with a wood-grain exterior finish and a natural beige rope handle on the left side. Inside the box, two table tennis paddles are placed horizontally—one with a red rubber surface and the other with a blue rubber surface—both featuring wooden handles with visible grain patterns and a small diamond-shaped logo near the base of each handle. A red and black box labeled “LES-BALLES-DE-TENNIS-DE-TABLE” and “Schildkröt” sits above the paddles, indicating it contains ping pong balls. The interior of the box is lined with brown corrugated cardboard, and a partitioned compartment holds the paddles securely. The lid of the box is propped open at an angle, revealing its plain brown inner surface. The entire setup is photographed against a white background, emphasizing clean lighting and product clarity.

Thinking process:  
First, analyze the editing instructions to determine what can be changed. The instruction explicitly transforms the paddles into cartoon explorers, changes their appearance (helmets, caps), alters color tones for vibrancy, reimagines the box as a treasure chest with golden edges, adds speech bubbles, and introduces a sketched treasure map background. These modifications directly affect the form, style, color scheme, and scene environment. Therefore, allowed changes include:
- Paddle shapes and expressions (transformed into cartoon characters)
- Color palette (vibrant adventure tones)
- Box design (reimagined as a treasure chest with shimmering gold edges)
- Background (introduction of a treasure map)
- Additions (speech bubbles, narrative elements)

However, the instructions do not mention altering or removing the core identity of the objects as part of a table tennis set. They also do not specify changing the brand name or structural features that define the original product. Thus, certain elements must remain unchanged to preserve recognition and functional logic.

Allowed Changes List:
- Paddle shape and facial features (to become cartoon explorers)
- Coloration of paddles (red/blue surfaces may be stylized but not removed)
- Box’s external texture (wood-grain pattern can be transformed into a treasure chest aesthetic)
- Interior layout (partitioned compartments can be reinterpreted)
- Background (white → treasure map)
- Added narrative elements (speech bubbles, dynamic motion)
- Overall composition (arrangement from static display to dynamic springing out)

Step 2 - Determine the elements that should remain unchanged

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements: The original image features specific branding and structural details that anchor its identity as a Schildkröt table tennis set. The "Schildkröt" brand name on both the ball box and paddle surface is a key identifier. The presence of two paddles with distinct red and blue rubber surfaces is essential for identifying the object type. The diamond-shaped logo on the paddle handles is a signature mark of the brand. These elements are crucial for brand recognition and product identification. Even if stylized, they must retain their core visual traits.

Functional/logical association elements: The relationship between the paddles and the storage box is logical—paddles are stored inside the box. This containment structure supports the function of a portable set. While the box's appearance may change (e.g., becoming a treasure chest), its role as a container must remain consistent. The position of the ball box within the top section of the main container is also logically tied to how such sets are typically organized.

Non-modified element deduction: After excluding allowed changes (like cartoon faces, colors, background), the remaining elements—such as the brand text, logo placement, number of paddles, and internal compartment structure—are critical to maintaining authenticity. Even if stylized, their positions, forms, and identities must be preserved.

Preservation Targets List:  
- The "Schildkröt" brand name on the ball box and paddle surface  
- The red and blue rubber surfaces of the paddles  
- The diamond-shaped logo on the paddle handles  
- The presence of two paddles in the set  
- The internal partitioned compartment structure holding the paddles  
- The rope handle attached to the left side of the box  
- The rectangular shape and hinged lid mechanism of the box

    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The "Schildkröt" brand name is a core identity feature of the product. It appears prominently on the ball box and faintly on the paddle surface. Removing or altering this text would misidentify the product and undermine brand recognition. This is a key element because it directly identifies the manufacturer and distinguishes this set from others. Its presence is essential for accurate product identification.
    Question: Is the "Schildkröt" brand name visible on the ball box and/or paddle surface?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The red and blue rubber surfaces of the paddles are distinctive functional features that define their use in table tennis. They are visually unique and help identify the paddles as standard equipment. Even if stylized into cartoon characters, the red and blue coloration must remain to maintain the connection to real-world table tennis gear. Their absence would make the paddles unrecognizable as such.
    Question: Are the paddles clearly depicted with one red rubber surface and one blue rubber surface?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The diamond-shaped logo on the paddle handles is a signature brand detail. It is a small but identifiable mark that links the paddles to the Schildkröt brand. If omitted or altered, the authenticity of the product representation is compromised. This logo is a secondary but important identifier that contributes to brand consistency.
    Question: Is there a diamond-shaped logo present on the handle of each paddle?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The presence of two paddles is a fundamental aspect of a standard table tennis set. The quantity is essential for gameplay and product classification. Changing the number would alter the functional identity of the set. Even in a whimsical narrative, the count must remain two to reflect reality.
    Question: Are exactly two paddles included in the set?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The rope handle on the left side of the box is a physical feature that enables portability. It is a tangible detail that defines the box’s usability. While the box may be transformed into a treasure chest, the handle must still exist in a similar location and form to preserve the original functional design.
    Question: Is a rope handle visibly attached to the left side of the box?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The internal partitioned compartment structure is a key design feature that secures the paddles in place. It reflects the practical engineering of the storage solution. Although the compartment may be stylized, its existence and function must remain intact to preserve the logical organization of the set.
    Question: Is there a horizontal partition inside the box that separates and holds the paddles?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The rectangular shape and hinged lid mechanism are core structural features of the box. They define its form as a portable case. Even if transformed into a treasure chest, the basic shape and opening method must remain recognizable to maintain continuity with the original object.
    Question: Does the box have a rectangular shape with a hinged lid that opens upward?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
