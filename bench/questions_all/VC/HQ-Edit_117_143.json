      "thinking_process": "The dancer’s pose—arms raised, body arched backward, head tilted up—is the core expressive gesture of the scene. It defines the emotional tone and action. If this posture is lost, the image no longer represents a moment of dance under the moon. This is a critical identity-defining feature, hence weight 3.",
      "question": "Is the dancer depicted in a dynamic pose with her left arm raised above her head and her body arched backward?",

      "thinking_process": "The hair’s gradient from dark blue to golden yellow is a distinctive visual trait not seen in typical depictions of dancers. Its presence contributes uniquely to the fantasy aesthetic and character identity. Removing or altering this gradient would make the figure less recognizable. This is a key identifying feature, thus weight 3.",
      "question": "Does the dancer’s hair display a clear color gradient from dark blue at the roots to golden yellow at the ends?",

      "thinking_process": "The red dress is central to the image’s theme and cultural connotation (flamenco). Although the instruction allows transforming it into flames, the original color must be preserved for continuity. Red is a core attribute tied to the subject’s identity and visual impact. Losing it would alter the essence of the costume. Weight 3.",
      "question": "Is the dancer wearing a bright red dress?",

      "thinking_process": "The crescent moon in the upper right corner is a major compositional and atmospheric anchor. The instruction mentions enhancing it with a reflection, but does not remove it. Its position and shape are essential for maintaining the night-time setting and celestial theme. Altering its location or removing it would break the scene’s logic. Weight 2.",
      "question": "Is there a yellow crescent moon visible in the upper right section of the sky?",

      "thinking_process": "The pink roses on both sides of the dancer provide symmetry and enhance the romantic, enchanted atmosphere. They are part of the original environmental design and contribute to the scene’s balance. Their removal would disrupt visual harmony. Though not core to identity, they are important contextual elements. Weight 2.",
      "question": "Are there clusters of pink roses growing on green bushes on both the left and right sides of the dancer?",

      "thinking_process": "The stone-tiled ground anchors the dancer physically and provides contrast to the organic elements. Its grid pattern and lighting suggest a formal space, possibly a courtyard. Changing or removing it would affect spatial grounding. While minor compared to other elements, it supports scene coherence. Weight 1.",
      "question": "Is the dancer standing on a surface composed of square stone tiles arranged in a grid pattern?",

      "thinking_process": "The red high-heeled dance shoes are functional and stylistic markers. They confirm the dancer’s role and align with traditional flamenco attire. Even if stylized, their presence and color should be maintained. Their absence would compromise the authenticity of the character. Weight 2.",

      "thinking_process": "The dancer’s upward gaze toward the sky reinforces the connection between her and the celestial elements (moon, stars). This directional focus is integral to the emotional narrative. Altering her gaze direction would shift the mood and intent of the image. Weight 2.",
