**Step 1 – Analyze the Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is an elderly woman with short, neatly styled silver-gray hair, wearing round-framed glasses. She is seated on a wooden park bench in a lush green outdoor setting, surrounded by dense foliage and dappled sunlight filtering through tree leaves. Her posture is upright and composed, with her head slightly tilted downward as she reads a large open book held in both hands. She wears a light blue cardigan over a pale floral-patterned scarf and a soft beige dress. The book in her hands has a dark cover and visible aged pages; another open book lies beside her on the bench. A light mint-green cushion rests to her left on the bench. The lighting is natural and warm, with a soft glow from the upper right corner suggesting sunlight breaking through the canopy.

Thinking process:  
The editing instruction specifies transforming the scene into a **serene art postcard**, depicting the woman as a **watercolor illustration** with **elaborate modifications**:  
- **Elongated robe drapes** → implies change to clothing silhouette and flow  
- **Botanical patterning** → indicates addition or transformation of patterns on clothing or background  
- **Sunlight filtering through leaves** → already present, but may be enhanced or stylized  
- **Text on the open book turning into leaf outlines** → directly alters content of the book's pages  
- **Muted border with literary motifs** → adds framing element not in original  

Thus, the following are explicitly allowed to change:  
- Style of rendering (from photographic realism to watercolor)  
- Clothing draping (length and flow)  
- Patterns on garments (addition of botanical motifs)  
- Content of book text (transforming into leaf outlines)  
- Addition of a muted border with literary motifs  
- Enhancement of sunlight effects (though existing light must be preserved in spirit)  

These changes involve **transformation of form, texture, content, and composition**, but do not mandate removal of core identity elements unless contradicted.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
- Rendering style (photorealistic → watercolor)  
- Drapery length and flow of the cardigan and dress  
- Addition of botanical patterns on clothing or background  
- Text on book pages transformed into leaf-shaped outlines  
- Introduction of a muted border with literary motifs (e.g., quills, scrolls, open books)  
- Enhancement of sunlight filtering effect (but not removal of source)  
- Visual texture of the book’s pages (to resemble organic forms)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

Thinking process:  
We now identify what **must remain unchanged** based on exclusion from the "Allowed Changes List" and logical consistency:

1. **Core recognition elements**:  
   - The **subject’s identity** as an elderly woman with **silver-gray hair** and **round glasses** is essential for continuity. While her attire may change, her **facial features**, **hair color**, **glasses shape**, and **posture** are key identifiers.  
   - The **act of reading** must persist — this defines the scene’s purpose. Thus, the **presence of a book in her hands**, **her gaze directed at it**, and **the hand position** must remain consistent.  
   - The **wooden bench** is part of the scene’s functional logic — she is sitting on it, so its **structure and placement** must be retained even if stylized.  
   - The **second open book** on the bench is a key contextual detail — its presence supports the theme of reading and leisure. It must remain in place, though its content can change.

2. **Functional/logical association elements**:  
   - The **position relationship** between the woman and the bench must remain — she is seated on it, facing forward, not standing or floating.  
   - The **hand holding the book** must maintain functional grip — fingers wrapped around the spine, thumb on page edge — to preserve the action of reading.  
   - The **orientation of the book** (open, angled toward her face) must be preserved to maintain narrative coherence.

3. **Non-modified element deduction**:  
   - Although the **cardigan color** might be altered subtly due to watercolor effect, the **original light blue tone** should still be recognizable.  
   - The **floral scarf** is a distinctive accessory — while patterns may be enhanced, its **presence and position** around the neck must remain.  
   - The **mint-green cushion** is a specific decorative element — its **placement and color** should be preserved unless explicitly replaced.  
   - The **background foliage** is part of the serene garden atmosphere — while stylized, the **dense greenery and tree trunks** must remain identifiable.  
   - The **sunlight direction** (upper right) must be preserved to maintain spatial logic of the scene.

Preservation Targets List:  
- The woman’s **silver-gray hair**, including its **short bob cut and volume**  
- The **round-framed glasses** worn on her face  
- The **act of reading**, evidenced by **her downward gaze and hands holding an open book**  
- The **wooden bench**, including its **slatted back and seat structure**  
- The **second open book** resting on the bench to her right  
- The **mint-green cushion** placed to her left on the bench  
- The **floral scarf** draped around her neck  
- The **light blue cardigan** worn over the blouse  
- The **beige dress** beneath the cardigan  
- The **natural outdoor setting** with **trees and green foliage**  
- The **direction and quality of sunlight** entering from the upper right

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

Q1:  
Thinking process: The **silver-gray hair** is a core identity feature of the elderly woman — its **color, length, and style** (short bob with slight waves) are unique visual markers that distinguish her from other subjects. If changed to another color or length, the subject’s identity would be compromised. This is a high-weight element because it is central to recognition.  
Question: Is the woman’s hair short, silver-gray, and styled in a neat bob with soft waves?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The **round-framed glasses** are a defining facial accessory. Their **circular shape and thin frame** are critical to identifying her appearance. Removing or altering them would significantly affect recognition.
