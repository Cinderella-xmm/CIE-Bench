      "thinking_process": "The texture of the whole wheat bread is a core identification feature of the original sandwich. It distinguishes it from white bread or other types and is essential for brand recognition. Even if the sandwich is transformed into a knight, the bread's grainy, porous surface should be preserved in the armor-like design to maintain visual continuity. Loss of this texture would make the original sandwich unrecognizable, hence it is a key element with a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the grainy, porous texture of the whole wheat bread slices?",

      "thinking_process": "The green lettuce leaves are a defining ingredient in the sandwich and contribute to its visual identity. Their presence and green color are essential for identifying the sandwich as a fresh, vegetable-filled product. Even in an anthropomorphic version, the lettuce should appear as part of the costume (e.g., cape) or filling to preserve the original content. Removing or altering the color would misrepresent the original sandwich, making it a significant retention point with a weight of 3.",
      "question": "Is the green color and leafy shape of the lettuce leaves preserved in the edited image?",

      "thinking_process": "The red tomato slice is a key component of the sandwich’s filling and provides contrast in both color and shape. Its presence at the bottom of the sandwich is a distinctive detail that helps identify the product. In the transformed image, even if stylized, the tomato should remain red and slice-shaped to maintain consistency with the original. Its absence or color change would break the visual link to the source image, thus warranting a weight of 3.",
      "question": "Is the red tomato slice visible and intact in the edited image?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The text “AMERICA’S” in brown serif font is a core branding element positioned above the ribbon. It is part of the official name and must be preserved to maintain brand identity. While the instruction allows for narrative text, it does not state that this original label should be removed. Any deviation in font, color, or position would undermine the original’s identity, so this is a high-priority retention element with a weight of 3.",
      "question": "Is the text “AMERICA’S” displayed in brown serif font above the ribbon in the edited image?",

      "thinking_process": "The maroon ribbon banner is a distinctive design feature that wraps around the sandwich and holds the word “Better.” Its color and placement are integral to the logo’s visual balance and branding. Even if the banner is reimagined as part of the knight’s attire, its maroon color and central horizontal position should be preserved. Losing this element would remove a key visual anchor, reducing coherence, so it is assigned a weight of 2.",
      "question": "Is the maroon ribbon banner present across the center of the sandwich in the edited image?",

      "thinking_process": "The trademark symbol ™ next to “SANDWICH” is a legal and branding identifier. Its presence confirms the proprietary nature of the product. Although minor, its omission could lead to misrepresentation or loss of brand authenticity. Since it is part of the original text, it should be retained unless explicitly stated otherwise. Thus, it is a detail-level element with a weight of 2.",
      "question": "Is the trademark symbol (™) present next to the word “SANDWICH” in the edited image?",

      "thinking_process": "The text “SANDWICH™” in brown serif font below the ribbon is another core branding component. It completes the product name and must be preserved for identity. While the instruction allows for narrative text, it does not require replacing this label. Changing its font, color, or position would disrupt brand recognition, so it is a critical retention element with a weight of 3.",
      "question": "Is the text “SANDWICH™” displayed in brown serif font below the ribbon in the edited image?",
