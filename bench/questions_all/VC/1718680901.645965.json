      "thinking_process": "The multi-tiered, spired roofline with sharp, upward-pointing finials and layered eaves is the most distinctive architectural feature of the original structure. It is the primary identifier of the building’s fantastical design. Even when transformed into a creature, this motif must be preserved in the creature’s silhouette to maintain visual continuity. Losing this would fundamentally alter the source identity, making the creature unrecognizable as inspired by the original. Thus, it is a core identity element with a weight of 3 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The golden metallic texture of the structure is a defining color and material characteristic. It contributes to the ancient, regal, and mystical aura of the original image. If the creature is rendered in a different material (e.g., dark stone or organic flesh), it would lose the visual link to the original. The golden hue is essential to maintaining the architectural essence. Therefore, it is a key identity element with a weight of 3 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The reflection in the water is a critical compositional element that enhances symmetry and tranquility. It is not merely decorative—it reinforces the scene’s serenity and visual balance. Even if the creature replaces the building, the presence of a reflective surface beneath it must be preserved to maintain environmental coherence. Without it, the scene loses its defining atmospheric quality. Thus, it is an important scene element with a weight of 2 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The symmetrical, octagonal layout of the original structure is a core geometric feature. It provides balance and order, distinguishing it from irregular or asymmetrical designs. The creature must maintain this symmetry in its body plan (e.g., eight limbs, radial symmetry) to reflect the building’s design. Loss of symmetry would break the architectural connection. This is a key structural element with a weight of 3 points.",

These elements must be incorporated into the creature’s anatomy (e.g., as ribs, leg joints, or facial features) to preserve the design language. Their absence would make the creature feel disconnected from the source. They are important design details with a weight of 2 points.",

While their exact species may vary, the presence of tall, leafy trees in the background is essential to maintain the original setting. Removing them would isolate the creature unnaturally.
