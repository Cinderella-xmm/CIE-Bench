**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a detailed illustration of a sandpiper bird in profile, facing left. The bird has a slender black beak, dark eyes, and a pale buff-colored head and neck with fine dark speckling on the crown. Its breast and underparts are a warm peachy-orange tone, transitioning into intricately patterned wings and back feathers featuring scalloped brown, black, and tan markings resembling fish-scale patterns. The tail is short and slightly rounded, with barred feather tips. The legs are long, thin, and dark gray-black, ending in three forward-facing toes with visible claws. The bird stands on a sandy shoreline with sparse tufts of beach grass and scattered pebbles. Behind it, a calm blue-gray sea meets the horizon under a plain off-white sky. The illustration style is naturalistic, with soft watercolor textures and delicate shading.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction specifies transforming the sandpiper into an "eco-friendly birdwatching kit packaging." This implies a complete transformation of the **subject's form** from a standalone bird to a **product box**, meaning the original bird’s physical presence as a living creature will no longer exist in its original form. However, the instruction explicitly states: *"Feature a stylized illustration of the sandpiper on the box front"*, which means the **visual representation** of the sandpiper must remain recognizable and derived from the original.

Additionally:
- “Nature-inspired textures” suggests that while the background may change, **textural qualities** like feather patterns or earth tones should be preserved in design elements.
- “Add text elements... labeling it as 'Shoreline Explorer Set'” indicates new content is introduced but does not affect the original visual content directly.
- “Incorporate a flat bottom with wave patterns” — this refers to the **base of the box**, implying the **original scene (shoreline)** may be reinterpreted into a decorative motif.
- “Include a cut-out window shaped like binoculars” — this adds a functional element to the packaging but does not require altering the core bird image unless it overlaps.

Thus, the **original bird illustration itself** is not being removed entirely but **repurposed as a graphic** on a new object (the box). Therefore, the **core visual identity** of the sandpiper must be retained in the stylized version.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
- The overall form of the subject (from bird to product packaging)  
- The background environment (from open shore to packaging design)  
- The addition of text ("Shoreline Explorer Set")  
- The inclusion of a binocular-shaped cut-out window  
- Introduction of wave patterns on the base  
- Application of nature-inspired textures (e.g., wood grain, leaf motifs) on the packaging surface  
- Repositioning of the bird illustration (as a printed design on a box)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
To determine what must be preserved, we apply exclusion based on the allowed changes:

**Core recognition elements:**  
The sandpiper’s identity depends on specific visual traits:
- The **distinctive scalloped wing pattern** with alternating dark and light bars forming scale-like shapes
- The **peach-orange breast** contrasting with darker upper parts
- The **long, straight black beak**
- The **dark eye** and **speckled crown**
- The **thin black legs** with three-toed feet
These are essential for identifying the species and distinguishing it from other shorebirds. Even if stylized, these features must be present to maintain fidelity to the original.

**Functional/logical association elements:**  
Although the bird is now on a box, the **illustration must still depict the bird standing on a shoreline**, because the instruction says: “Feature a stylized illustration of the sandpiper on the box front.” This implies that the **pose and setting** (standing on sand near water) should be preserved in the depiction, even if simplified.

**Non-modified element deduction:**  
While the background can be redesigned, the **presence of sand, water, and grass** in the original scene is implied by the instruction to include “wave patterns” and “nature-inspired textures,” suggesting that **the ecological context** (shoreline) must be referenced visually. Therefore, **key environmental cues** like the sandy ground and water horizon must appear in the stylized illustration.

However, **specific details such as exact color values or shadowing** may be adjusted for stylistic reasons, so only **iconic forms and structural features** are required to be retained.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
- The scalloped pattern on the wings and back  
- The peach-orange breast and throat  
- The long straight black beak  
- The dark eye and speckled crown  
- The three-toed feet with dark legs  
- The bird’s stance: standing upright on sand near water  
- The presence of beach grass and pebbles in the foreground  
- The contrast between warm underparts and mottled upper body

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The scalloped wing pattern is a defining characteristic of this sandpiper species, particularly in field guides. It consists of repeating dark-edged, light-centered feather shapes arranged in overlapping rows. Losing this pattern would make the bird unrecognizable as this species. Thus, it is a core identification feature with high weight.
    Question: Does the stylized illustration retain the scalloped pattern on the wings and back, with alternating dark and light feather edges forming a scale-like texture?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The peach-orange breast is a key diagnostic trait of the bird during breeding plumage. It contrasts sharply with the darker upperparts and is central to species identification. Any significant alteration in color or absence would misrepresent the bird.
    Question: Is the breast and throat area rendered in a consistent peach-orange hue, distinct from the darker upper body?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The long, straight black beak is a primary identifier of shorebirds and distinguishes this species from others with shorter or curved bills. Its shape and color are critical for accurate representation.
    Question: Is the beak long, straight, and uniformly black, extending from the face without curvature?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The dark eye with surrounding pale skin is a focal point in the illustration and helps define facial structure. While minor stylization is acceptable, the presence and position of the eye are essential for maintaining the bird’s likeness.
    Question: Is there a clearly defined dark eye positioned near the center of the head, surrounded by lighter skin?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The three-toed feet with dark legs are typical of sandpipers and help confirm the bird’s posture and species. Altering the number of toes or leg color would misrepresent the anatomy.
    Question: Are the legs dark gray-black and do they end in three forward-facing toes with visible claws?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The bird’s stance—standing upright on sand near water—is part of the original composition and implied by the instruction to preserve the shoreline context. Even if stylized, the pose must reflect a natural resting position on a beach.
    Question: Is the bird depicted in a standing posture, with legs fully extended and body upright, as if on a shoreline?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The presence of beach grass and pebbles in the foreground grounds the bird in its natural habitat. While simplified, their inclusion supports ecological authenticity and visual coherence.
    Question: Are there small tufts of beach grass and scattered pebbles visible in the foreground beneath the bird’s feet?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}
{
    Q8: 
    Thinking process: The contrast between the warm underparts and mottled upper body is a key visual cue for species recognition. This tonal division defines the bird’s silhouette and pattern.
    Question: Is there a clear transition from the warm peach-orange underparts to the darker, mottled upper body and wings?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
