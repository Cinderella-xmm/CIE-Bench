      "thinking_process": "The woman’s pose—leaning on the column with her head turned toward the viewer—is the core compositional identifier of the original portrait. This specific orientation defines the subject’s presence and gaze, making it essential for recognition. If this pose is altered (e.g., upright stance or different head angle), the figurine would lose its identity as a representation of the original subject. Thus, preserving this posture is critical for maintaining the work’s identity.",

      "thinking_process": "The pastel blue gown is a defining feature of the subject’s attire. Its color, flow, and floral patterns are unique to this portrait. Even when transformed into porcelain, the gown’s **pastel blue hue** and **floral embellishments** must remain unchanged to ensure visual continuity. Losing these would make the figurine unrecognizable as a derivative of the original.",
      "question": "Is the gown predominantly pastel blue with floral embellishments on the bodice and sleeves?",

      "thinking_process": "The pearl necklace is a prominent accessory, worn in multiple strands and clearly visible across the chest. It is a signature element of the subject’s elegance and identity. In the figurine version, it must be replicated in form and position, even if made of glazed ceramic. Removing or altering it would disrupt the visual authenticity of the transformation.",
      "question": "Is there a multi-strand pearl necklace visible around the woman’s neck, extending down to her chest?",

      "thinking_process": "The white ornate column is a structural and compositional anchor. It supports the woman’s arm and grounds the figure in space. The column’s **carved details** and **position** are crucial for maintaining the spatial logic of the scene. Even in miniature, the column must retain its **form and placement** to preserve the relationship between the figure and the environment.",

      "thinking_process": "The gold-accented mantle surface is explicitly mentioned in the instruction as a feature to be matched. It provides contrast and richness to the scene. The **glossy finish** and **golden highlights** must be preserved in the figurine’s base to maintain visual consistency with the original. This is a key environmental detail that supports the overall aesthetic.",

      "thinking_process": "The ring on the woman’s right hand is a subtle but identifiable detail. Its presence contributes to the realism and individuality of the subject. Even in ceramic form, the ring must remain on the same finger and in the same position to maintain fidelity to the original. Its loss would be a minor but noticeable deviation.",

      "thinking_process": "The floral patterns on the gown are not just decorative—they are integral to the design and identity of the dress. These patterns must be replicated in the porcelain version with **exact placement and shape** to ensure the figurine remains faithful to the original. Their absence or distortion would break the visual connection.",

      "thinking_process": "The position of the arms—left arm resting on the column, right arm hanging naturally—is essential for maintaining the balance and posture of the figure. Altering this would disrupt the natural flow of the pose. Even in ceramic form, the **arm positions** must remain unchanged to preserve the original composition.",
