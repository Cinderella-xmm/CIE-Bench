      "thinking_process": "The side panel with elongated oval cutouts is a key design feature that distinguishes this hiking boot model. Its presence and shape are essential for identification. If altered or removed, the boot would no longer resemble the original. This is a core structural element, making it a 3-point question.",
      "question": "Does the boot retain the same shape and arrangement of the elongated oval cutouts on the side panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The lacing system, including the number and alignment of eyelets, is a functional and visual identifier. The original has six visible eyelets arranged vertically with consistent spacing. Changing their count or position would disrupt the boot’s identity. This is a core structural element tied to function and form, hence weight 3.",
      "question": "Are the eyelets positioned in the same vertical alignment and spacing as in the original boot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The tread pattern on the outsole is a defining functional feature. The original has deep grooves and ridges forming a specific geometric pattern. Altering this would affect both the boot’s recognizability and its perceived purpose. This is a critical detail for structural authenticity, thus weighted 3.",
      "question": "Does the outsole retain the exact tread pattern and groove depth as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The toe cap is a prominent feature, both visually and functionally. In the original, it is a black, rounded, reinforced section at the front. Even when converted to wood, its shape and position must be preserved. Losing this would distort the boot’s identity. This is a key structural component, so it receives a weight of 3.",
      "question": "Is the toe cap present and shaped identically to the original, including its rounded front and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The padded collar at the top of the boot is a distinctive ergonomic feature. Its shape and placement above the laces help define the boot’s high-top profile. Removing or altering it would make the boot look like a different model. This is an important design detail, but less central than the panels or sole, so it gets 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the padded collar at the top of the boot preserved in shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The overall orientation of the boot — side profile with a slight forward tilt — is crucial for maintaining visual consistency with the original. Changing this angle would alter perception and reduce fidelity. While not a core identity element, it affects coherence and should be preserved. Thus, it is a 2-point question.",
      "question": "Is the boot positioned in the same side profile with the same forward tilt as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The tongue of the boot is located beneath the laces and has a defined shape. Its presence ensures the boot’s internal structure remains recognizable. Although small, it contributes to the boot’s authenticity. This is a minor but identifiable detail, so it receives 1 point.",
      "question": "Is the tongue of the boot visible and shaped similarly to the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "thinking_process": "The heel counter is a raised, supportive structure at the back of the boot. Its shape and position are key to the boot’s stability and design. Even in wood, it must retain its form. This is a functional and structural detail, but not as iconic as the panels or sole, so it gets 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the heel counter present and shaped identically to the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
