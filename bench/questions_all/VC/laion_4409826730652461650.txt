Description of reference image: The subject is a plush rocking horse toy with a soft, textured fur body in light tan and white coloration. The head features a white blaze down the center of the face, a pink mouth, and large yellow eyes with black pupils. The mane and tail are dark brown, and the ears are upright with a small red and yellow logo on the left ear. A brown fabric bridle is fitted over the head, with a wooden handle extending from the back of the neck. The body is mounted on a molded plastic rocking base in a light brown tone, featuring four dark brown wheels attached to the legs, allowing for both rocking and rolling motion. The base has a curved rocker design with visible structural supports and a label reading "Rockin' Rider" embossed on the side. The overall posture is standing, facing slightly to the left, with all four legs positioned firmly on the base.

Thinking process:  
First, analyze the editing instructions word by word. The instruction specifies creating a cartoon strip starring the plush horse as a cowboy hero in a Wild West setting. This indicates a complete transformation of the scene and context. However, the core subject—the plush horse—is to be reimagined as a character, implying that its identity must remain recognizable despite stylization. The instruction specifies changes in expression (determined, smiling), action (lasso twirling), and setting (dusty road, cacti, saloons). These are explicit changes to the scene and behavior, not to the fundamental identity of the subject.

Allowed Changes List:  
- Scene environment (e.g., dusty road, cacti, wooden saloons)  
- Expression of the horse (determined, smiling)  
- Action (lasso twirling)  
- Style (bold outlines, vibrant colors, cartoonish rendering)  
- Text overlay ("Wild, Wild Horse Adventures!")  
- Background elements (cacti, saloons, sky, etc.)  

The instruction does **not** mention altering the core physical form or identifying features of the plush horse—such as its color pattern, texture, bridle, wheels, or base structure—only how it is portrayed within a new narrative context. Therefore, these elements must be preserved in their original visual form unless transformed into a cartoon version that retains their essence.

Step 2 – Determine the elements that should remain unchanged  
Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements: The plush horse’s identity relies on specific visual markers that distinguish it from other toys or animals. These include:  
- The tan and white fur pattern, especially the white blaze on the face and chest patch  
- The dark brown mane and tail  
- The brown fabric bridle with a wooden handle  
- The four dark brown wheels attached to the legs  
- The light brown plastic rocking base with “Rockin’ Rider” branding  
These are essential for recognizing the toy as the original product. Changing them would make the character unrecognizable as the source object.

Functional/logical association elements: The wheels and rocking base are functional components that define the toy’s purpose (rocking and rolling). Even in a cartoon style, these must be retained in form or implication to preserve the logical function of the toy. For example, if the wheels are removed or replaced with hooves, the mechanical logic of the toy is lost.

Non-modified element deduction: After excluding allowed changes (scene, expression, action, style), the remaining details—such as the fur texture, bridle placement, wheel attachment points, and base shape—must be retained. These are not mentioned as changeable, and their removal or alteration would break visual continuity with the original.

Preservation Targets List:  
- The tan and white fur coloration pattern  
- The dark brown mane and tail  
- The brown fabric bridle with wooden handle  
- The four dark brown wheels attached to the legs  
- The light brown rocking base with “Rockin’ Rider” branding  
- The position and shape of the ears, including the logo on the left ear  
- The white blaze on the face and chest patch  
- The pink mouth and yellow eyes with black pupils

    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The tan and white fur pattern, particularly the white blaze on the face and chest patch, is a core identity feature of this specific plush horse model. It distinguishes it from other rocking horses and is essential for recognition. Losing this pattern would result in a different animal or toy being depicted, undermining the connection to the original product. This is a key visual identifier, hence a weight of 3 points.

    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The dark brown mane and tail are distinctive features that contribute to the horse’s appearance and species identification. They are consistent across the original image and serve as part of the plush toy's aesthetic signature. Removing or altering their color or texture would change the visual identity of the horse. This is a core recognition element, thus assigned 3 points.

    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The brown fabric bridle with a wooden handle is a functional and iconic accessory of the toy. It is clearly visible in the original image and defines the horse’s design. In a cartoon adaptation, even if stylized, the presence of a bridle and handle must be preserved to maintain the toy’s identity. Its absence would make the character unrecognizable as the original product. Hence, it is a core element with a weight of 3 points.

    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The four dark brown wheels attached to the legs are a functional feature of the toy, enabling rolling movement. They are a defining characteristic of this specific model and differentiate it from traditional wooden rocking horses. Their removal or replacement would alter the toy’s identity and functionality. This is a critical functional element, so it must be preserved. Assigned 3 points.

    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The light brown plastic rocking base with the “Rockin’ Rider” branding is a unique structural and commercial identifier of the product. The base shape and branding are integral to recognizing the toy’s origin. Even in a cartoon style, the base must retain its form and labeling to maintain authenticity. This is a key brand and functional element, thus assigned 3 points.

    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The white blaze on the face and chest patch is a secondary but distinct marking that contributes to the horse’s individuality. While less central than the fur pattern, its absence would reduce visual fidelity and recognition. It is a detail-level identifier, so it is important but not critical. Assigned 2 points.

    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The pink mouth and yellow eyes with black pupils are facial features that give the horse a friendly, expressive look. They are consistent in the original and help identify the character’s emotion. In a cartoon, they may be exaggerated, but their presence must be maintained for consistency. This is a minor detail but affects character recognition. Assigned 1 point.
