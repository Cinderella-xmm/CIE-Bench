Description of reference image: The subject is a pair of scissors with golden handles and silver blades, placed against a dark gray background. The blades are open, forming a V-shape, while the handles display a polished gold finish. The scissors rest centrally on the surface, with their blades reflecting light visibly. The background is a flat, uniform dark gray, offering a stark contrast to the metallic sheen of the scissors.

### Step 1 - Allowed Changes List:
Specific element 1 that allows for changes: Adding text ("Sharp" at the top left and "Clean" at the bottom right) as a rough sketch.
Specific element 2 that allows for changes: Adjustments to the overall composition to accommodate the added text, ensuring the focus remains on the scissors.

### Step 2 - Preservation Targets List:
Thinking process:  
- **Core recognition elements:** The golden handles and silver blades, along with their reflective qualities and sharpness, are crucial for recognizing the scissors as a functional tool. The open position of the blades is also key.
- **Functional/logical association elements:** The arrangement of the handles and blades must remain logical to depict a usable pair of scissors.
- **Remaining elements based on visual coherence:** Details like the material's texture and lighting reflections should be kept intact for visual consistency.

Preservation Targets List:  
(Element 1 that should be maintained: Golden handles with polished finish)  
(Element 2 that should be maintained: Silver blades with reflective quality)  
(Element 3 that should be maintained: Open V-shape configuration of the blades)  
(Element 4 that should be maintained: Dark gray background providing contrast)  
(Element 5 that should be maintained: Clean and sharp edges of the blades)
