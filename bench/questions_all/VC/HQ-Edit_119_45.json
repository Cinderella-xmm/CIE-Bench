      "thinking_process": "The nemes headdress is the most iconic feature of pharaonic masks, with its distinctive striped pattern of alternating gold and blue bands. Its shape — wide, layered, and draping over the shoulders — is a core identity marker. Even if transformed into brass and copper, the **overall silhouette and striped structure must remain** to preserve the subject’s identity. This is a 3-point element because altering its shape would make the object unrecognizable as a pharaonic mask.",
      "question": "Is the nemes headdress present with its characteristic wide, striped, layered shape covering the head and shoulders?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The uraeus cobra is a sacred symbol placed centrally on the forehead of pharaonic masks. It is a **core identification feature** — its presence and position are essential for authenticity. The instruction does not mention removing it, only replacing materials, so its **location and form** must be preserved. Losing it would compromise the cultural and symbolic identity of the mask, making it a 3-point element.",
      "question": "Is the uraeus cobra positioned centrally on the forehead, above the eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The false beard is a defining attribute of Egyptian pharaohs in funerary art. It is a **vertical, pleated extension** from the chin, typically made of gold or stone. Although the material may be replaced with brass or copper, its **presence, position, and shape** must remain unchanged. Removing or relocating it would destroy the subject’s identity. This is a 3-point element due to its symbolic importance.",
      "question": "Is there a false beard extending vertically from the chin, matching the original pleated form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The eyes are a critical part of the mask’s expression and realism. They are **large, almond-shaped, and positioned symmetrically** under thick brows. Their **shape and placement** are non-negotiable for recognition. Even if made of glass or mechanical parts, their **original contour and position** must be preserved. This is a 2-point element because while the material can change, the **visual form** is essential for coherence.",
      "question": "Are the eyes almond-shaped and positioned symmetrically beneath thick eyebrows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The ears are anatomically accurate and placed on either side of the head. They are **small, rounded, and clearly defined** — a detail that contributes to the human likeness of the mask. Though not symbolic, they are part of the **realistic facial structure** and must remain in place for consistency. Altering their position or shape would disrupt facial symmetry. This is a 2-point element due to its role in facial integrity.",
      "question": "Are the ears present on both sides of the head, with natural human ear shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The collar (wesekh) is a broad, layered band around the neck with a specific width and horizontal structure. While its internal design can be reimagined with clockwork, its **outline and placement** must remain. The instruction says \"reimagine the collar\", not \"remove it\", so its **physical presence and position** are required. This is a 2-point element because it defines the lower boundary of the mask.",
      "question": "Is there a broad collar encircling the neck, maintaining its original width and horizontal band structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The frontal, symmetrical pose is essential to the hieratic style of Egyptian funerary art. The mask faces directly forward, with no tilt or turn. This **posture is foundational** to its identity. Any deviation would alter its cultural representation. This is a 3-point element because it defines the entire visual language of the artifact.",
      "question": "Is the mask presented in a strictly frontal, symmetrical view with no rotation or tilt?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
