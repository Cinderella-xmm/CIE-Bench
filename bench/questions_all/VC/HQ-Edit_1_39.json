      "thinking_process": "The wooden window frame with its horizontal beam and vertical stone pillars is a defining architectural feature of the scene. Its shape, material, and placement are critical for maintaining the original setting. If removed or altered, the entire spatial context collapses. This is a core structural element anchoring the composition, thus earning a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the rectangular wooden window frame with stone pillars on both sides present and unaltered?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The desert landscape beyond the window, including the distant mountains and scattered cacti, provides essential environmental context. Removing or altering these would break the thematic consistency of the scene. The presence of specific elements like the tall saguaro-like cacti confirms the desert setting. This is a major scene element affecting overall coherence, hence a weight of 2 points.",
      "question": "Are the distant mountains and multiple upright cacti visible in the background beyond the window?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The lighting direction and shadow cast by the pot and window frame are crucial for visual realism and depth. The sunlight comes from the right, casting shadows to the left, which defines the time of day and spatial orientation. Altering this would disrupt the scene’s logic and consistency. This is an important environmental cue, so it earns 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the shadow of the pot cast to the left on the wooden sill, indicating sunlight from the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The color of the sky is a key atmospheric element—clear blue with soft white clouds. This establishes the time of day and weather. Changing it would alter the mood and realism of the scene. While not the central subject, it is a vital backdrop detail that contributes to authenticity. Thus, it is a significant but secondary element, earning 1 point.",
      "question": "Is the sky above the desert a clear blue with scattered white clouds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The wooden surface of the windowsill, including its grain and wear marks, contributes to the rustic aesthetic. It serves as the base for the subject and interacts with light and shadow. Though minor compared to the frame or landscape, it maintains tactile realism and continuity. This is a detail-level element, so it receives 1 point.",
      "question": "Is the windowsill made of weathered wooden planks with visible grain and cracks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The relative positioning of the subject (potted cactus) within the center of the window frame is essential for compositional balance. Even after transformation, the creature must occupy the same spatial location to preserve visual continuity. This ensures the edited image remains grounded in the original layout. It is a logical placement anchor, thus worth 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the transformed creature positioned centrally within the window frame, on the windowsill?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The texture and color of the distant terrain—dry, pale tan with low scrub vegetation—are characteristic of a desert biome. Preserving this ensures the environment remains authentic and consistent with the original. While subtle, this detail reinforces the setting. It is a supporting environmental feature, so it earns 1 point.",
      "question": "Is the ground beyond the window a flat, arid desert terrain with sparse dry grass and shrubs?",
