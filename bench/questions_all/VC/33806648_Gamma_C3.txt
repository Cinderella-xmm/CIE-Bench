Description of reference image: The subject is a natural rock arch formation within a cave-like structure, composed of layered sedimentary rock with visible stratification and rough, eroded textures. The arch spans the upper portion of the frame, forming an opening that reveals a bright outdoor sky and distant greenery beyond. The interior of the cave is dimly lit, with sunlight streaming in through the arch, casting sharp shadows on the ground below. The ground consists of compacted earth and scattered rocks, with a fallen log lying diagonally across the foreground. The rock surfaces display variations in color from beige to light brown, with some areas showing weathering patterns and subtle mineral streaks. The overall composition emphasizes depth, with the arch framing the exterior landscape and guiding the viewer’s gaze outward.

Thinking process:  
The editing instruction explicitly transforms the rock arch into an ethereal stone guardian creature with crystalline growths, glowing veins, skeletal wing-like extensions, runic symbols, and a radiant orb at its core. This indicates that the **form and appearance** of the arch are fully permitted to change—its shape, texture, and symbolic representation can be reimagined. However, no mention is made of altering the **scene context**, such as the lighting contrast between shadow and sunlight, the presence of the fallen log, or the general spatial layout (e.g., the cave floor leading toward the arch). Additionally, while the arch itself is being transformed, the **environmental logic**—such as the direction of light entering from outside and illuminating the interior—must remain consistent unless stated otherwise. Therefore, changes are allowed for:

- The **arch's physical form** (shape, surface features)
- The **texture and material** of the arch
- The **addition of fantastical elements** (crystals, runes, glow, wings)

But **not allowed** are changes that would disrupt the fundamental scene logic or remove key environmental anchors.

Allowed Changes List:
- The shape and silhouette of the rock arch
- The surface texture and material of the arch (now including crystals, veins, runes)
- The addition of glowing elements, wing-like structures, and a radiant orb
- The transformation of the arch into a sentient or mythical entity

Step 2 - Determine the elements that should remain unchanged  
Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements: While the arch is being transformed, it remains part of a larger **natural cave environment**. The original image includes specific visual cues that define the scene’s identity and spatial coherence. These include the **direction of light entry**, the **presence of the fallen log**, the **rocky ground surface**, and the **visible sky and distant vegetation** through the arch. These are not mentioned as subjects for change and are essential to maintaining the **spatial realism** and **visual continuity** of the scene. Even though the arch becomes a mythical creature, the surrounding environment must still logically support that transformation—i.e., the light must still come from the same direction, and the ground must still exist beneath the arch.

Functional/logical association elements: The **light source** entering from the arch opening is critical to the scene’s realism. If the light were redirected or blocked by the new creature form, it would break the logical flow of illumination. Similarly, the **position of the fallen log** on the ground provides scale and grounding; removing or relocating it without cause would disrupt the scene’s coherence. The **ground surface** and **rock formations** below the arch must remain because they anchor the viewer’s perspective and provide a base for the transformed arch to stand upon.

Non-modified element deduction: After excluding all elements explicitly allowed to change (the arch’s form, texture, and symbolic additions), the remaining environmental components—the **log**, **ground**, **light direction**, **sky view**, and **distant trees**—must be preserved. These are not part of the transformation and serve as stable references that maintain the integrity of the original setting.

Preservation Targets List:  
- The fallen log lying diagonally across the foreground  
- The direction and quality of sunlight entering through the arch opening  
- The rocky ground surface beneath the arch  
- The visible sky and distant greenery seen through the arch  
- The overall spatial depth and perspective of the cave interior  

Q1:  
Thinking process: The fallen log is a distinct, physically present object in the foreground that contributes to the scene’s realism and scale. Its presence is not referenced in the editing instructions, meaning it should remain unaltered. Removing or modifying it would disrupt the visual balance and spatial grounding of the scene. It is a minor but identifiable detail that supports the original environment’s authenticity.  
Question: Is the fallen log still present in the foreground, lying diagonally across the cave floor?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The direction of sunlight entering through the arch is a core element of the original image’s lighting dynamics. The instructions do not state that the light source should be altered, so the sunlit area on the right side of the arch and the shadow cast on the left must remain consistent. Changing this would break the logical relationship between the interior and exterior environments.  
Question: Does sunlight still enter from the arch opening and illuminate the right side of the cave interior?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The rocky ground surface beneath the arch is a foundational element of the scene. It defines the terrain and provides continuity between the foreground and background. Since the instructions focus only on transforming the arch and not the floor, this surface must remain intact. Altering it would undermine the physical consistency of the environment.  
Question: Is the rocky, uneven ground surface visible beneath the arch and extending toward the foreground?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The visible sky and distant greenery through the arch are key indicators of the external environment. They establish context and depth. The instructions do not specify replacing or obscuring this view, so it must remain visible. Losing this would eliminate the sense of openness and connection to the outside world.  
Question: Is the bright sky and distant tree-covered hillside still visible through the arch opening?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The spatial depth created by the cave’s interior leading toward the arch is essential to the image’s composition. The perspective lines formed by the rock walls and the path to the opening must remain consistent. This depth is not mentioned as something to be changed, so it must be preserved to maintain the scene’s realism and navigability.  
Question: Is the cave interior structured with converging rock walls and a clear path leading toward the arch opening?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The texture and color variation of the rock surfaces (beige to light brown with weathering patterns) are characteristic of the original geological formation. While the arch itself may gain new textures, the surrounding rock walls should retain their natural appearance unless specified otherwise. Preserving these textures maintains the authenticity of the non-transformed parts of the scene.  
Question: Are the surrounding rock walls still composed of layered sedimentary rock with natural weathering patterns and beige-to-brown coloration?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
