Description of reference image: The subject is a male surfer with long, wavy light brown hair, seated on a sandy beach at sunset. He is wearing a black full-sleeve wetsuit and is crouched slightly forward, leaning over a white surfboard placed horizontally in front of him. His right hand holds a small white wax block, applying it to the textured surface of the surfboard, while his left hand rests flat on the board for stability. The surfboard has a visible central stringer running along its length and a rough, granular texture typical of waxed surfaces. The background features a golden-orange sunset sky with the sun positioned low on the horizon, casting warm backlighting across the scene. The ocean waves are gently rolling toward the shore, reflecting the sunlight in shimmering highlights. The sand appears smooth and wet near the waterline, transitioning to drier areas further back. The lighting creates strong silhouetting on the figure’s face and body, emphasizing contours and depth.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions that clearly state what can be changed. The instruction specifies transforming the scene into a snow globe setting, which implies a complete reimagining of the environment and presentation format. The original subject (the surfer) is to be transformed into a chibi-style 3D figure, indicating that the form, proportions, and style of the human figure are allowed to change. The scene is explicitly replaced: the outdoor beach at sunset is to be enclosed within a glass dome, resting on a wooden shelf near a fireplace. This means the external environment (beach, ocean, sky) is no longer part of the final composition but is instead reinterpreted as an internal miniature scene inside the globe. The instruction also introduces new elements such as snowflakes, golden ambient light from the fireplace, and a chibi character, all of which are not present in the original image and thus represent additions rather than modifications.

Allowed Changes List:
- The physical form and style of the surfer (transformed into a chibi-style 3D figure)
- The scale and proportion of the subject (reduced to miniature size)
- The overall scene context (from open beach to enclosed snow globe)
- The background environment (ocean, sky, sunset replaced by interior of a snow globe)
- The lighting source (sunlight replaced by soft golden glow from a fireplace)
- The presence of snowflakes and sparkle effects
- The addition of a wooden shelf and fireplace in the external environment

Step 2 - Determine the elements that should remain unchanged  
Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements: Although the subject is to be stylized into a chibi figure, the core identity of the action—polishing a surfboard—is preserved in the instruction. Therefore, the functional relationship between the figure and the surfboard must remain intact. The act of waxing the board is central to the narrative and must be retained in some form. Additionally, the surfboard itself, as a key object associated with surfing, must retain its essential identity: it must still be a surfboard with a recognizable shape and function. The texture of the board's surface, particularly the waxed grain, is a critical detail that supports this function and should be preserved even if stylized.

Functional/logical association elements: The interaction between the hands and the surfboard is crucial. The right hand holding the wax block and applying it to the board, and the left hand stabilizing the board, represents a logical sequence of motion and purpose. Even in a chibi or 3D stylized version, this gesture must be preserved to maintain the authenticity of the activity. If the hands were removed or repositioned without performing the waxing action, the scene would lose its intended meaning.

Non modified element deduction: After excluding the allowed changes (subject style, environment, lighting), the remaining visual content that must be retained includes the surfboard’s shape, the waxing action, the position of the hands relative to the board, and the general posture of the figure engaged in the task. These are not explicitly mentioned as changeable, and their retention ensures continuity with the original image’s intent and narrative.

Preservation Targets List:  
- The surfboard’s elongated oval shape with a central stringer  
- The presence of a wax block being applied to the board’s surface  
- The right hand holding the wax block and making contact with the board  
- The left hand resting flat on the board for support  
- The textured surface of the surfboard indicative of wax application  

Q1:  
Thinking process: The surfboard’s elongated oval shape with a central stringer is a core identification feature of a standard surfboard. This shape is essential for distinguishing it from other boards or objects. In the original image, the surfboard has a distinct pointed nose and rounded tail, with a visible line (stringer) running down the center. Losing this shape would make the object unrecognizable as a surfboard, undermining the entire theme of the scene. Therefore, this is a key identity element and must be preserved even in a stylized form.  
Question: Is the surfboard depicted with an elongated oval shape and a central stringer running along its length?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The wax block being held in the right hand and applied to the board is a functional element that defines the action taking place. The presence of the wax block and its placement on the board’s surface is critical to identifying the activity as surfboard waxing. Without this, the scene loses its narrative coherence. Even in a chibi or 3D form, the wax block must be visibly present and in contact with the board.  
Question: Is there a small white wax block being held by the right hand and applied to the surface of the surfboard?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The right hand’s position—holding the wax block and pressing it onto the board—is a key gesture that conveys the action of waxing. This specific hand pose is necessary to maintain the functional logic of the scene. If the hand were not in contact with the wax or the board, the action would be misrepresented.  
Question: Is the right hand positioned so that the fingers are gripping the wax block and making direct contact with the surfboard’s surface?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The left hand resting flat on the surfboard provides balance and stability during the waxing process. This positioning is a logical extension of the action and helps anchor the figure’s posture. It is a secondary but important detail that contributes to the realism and coherence of the scene. Even in a stylized version, this hand placement should be preserved to maintain the integrity of the pose.  
Question: Is the left hand placed flat on the surfboard, parallel to the board’s surface, providing support?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The textured surface of the surfboard, showing granular wax patterns, is a distinctive visual feature that confirms the board has been waxed. This texture is not just decorative—it signifies the functional preparation of the board for use. In the original image, this texture is clearly visible under the warm light. Retaining this texture, even in a simplified form, ensures the board remains identifiable as a waxed surfboard.  
Question: Does the surfboard’s surface show a granular, textured pattern consistent with wax application?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The posture of the figure—crouched forward with knees bent and torso leaning over the board—is a key compositional element that reflects engagement in the task. While the figure may be stylized into a chibi form, the overall orientation and body language must remain consistent to preserve the sense of focused activity. This posture is not explicitly stated as changeable, so it should be retained.  
Question: Is the figure positioned in a crouched, forward-leaning posture with knees bent and upper body angled over the surfboard?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
