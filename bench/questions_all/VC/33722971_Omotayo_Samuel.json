      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "The number of suitcases is a core structural element of the original composition. There are exactly four distinct pieces of luggage stacked vertically. Changing the count would fundamentally alter the visual balance and narrative weight of the scene. Even when transformed into anthropomorphic characters, the total number must remain four to preserve the original configuration. This is a foundational element of the image’s identity.",
      "question": "Does the edited image contain exactly four suitcases?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The vertical stacking order of the suitcases establishes a clear hierarchy and structural integrity. The bottom two are rectangular, followed by a round case, then a duffel on top. Reordering these would disrupt the visual logic and make the transformation unrecognizable as derived from the original. The sequence is essential to maintaining the original's spatial narrative.",
      "question": "Are the suitcases stacked in the same order from bottom to top: two rectangular, one round, one duffel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Each suitcase has a unique shape that distinguishes it from the others. The bottom two are rectangular with metal corners, the third is distinctly round, and the fourth is a soft duffel. These shapes are iconic identifiers. Even if stylized with faces, their fundamental geometry must remain recognizable. Losing the roundness of the third case, for instance, would misrepresent the original.",
      "question": "Is the third suitcase from the bottom clearly round in shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The figure stands to the right of the luggage stack, facing left, in profile. This lateral positioning is critical to the composition’s balance and narrative direction. Moving the figure to the left or center would break the original spatial relationship. Even as a whimsical traveler figurehead, its placement relative to the luggage must remain unchanged.",
      "question": "Is the figure positioned to the right of the luggage stack?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The figure is shown in side profile, looking toward the left. This orientation defines the viewer’s perspective and the direction of attention. Altering the head angle or turning the figure forward would change the narrative focus and disorient the scene. The profile view is a key compositional choice that must be preserved.",
      "question": "Is the figure depicted in side profile, facing left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The support relationship between the suitcases is implied by their stacking. Each case rests upon the one below, creating a stable tower. Disrupting this support chain—such as floating suitcases or diagonal placement—would destroy the original physical logic. Even in an animated form, the structural dependency must be visually evident.",
      "question": "Do the suitcases rest directly on top of one another in a stable vertical stack?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The presence of one human figure is central to the narrative. Adding or removing figures would fundamentally alter the scene’s meaning. Even if stylized as a traveler figurehead, only one figure should appear. This ensures consistency with the original’s singular focus.",
      "question": "Is there exactly one human figure present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
