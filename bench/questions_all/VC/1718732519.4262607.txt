**Step 1 – Analyze the Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject consists of a glass bottle filled with amber-colored liquid, labeled "Widaelis PHSDOGE," with a red cap and a retro-style label featuring white text on a red background. The bottle has vertical ridges and is positioned upright on a wooden surface. Next to it, on a light brown wooden cutting board, lies a hot dog in a split bun, topped with zigzag lines of yellow mustard. The hot dog is elongated, reddish-brown, and appears cooked, with the bun slightly open at one end. The background includes a blurred window with natural daylight, a dark gray wall, a small potted plant to the right, and a partial view of a red lid and a small dish containing condiments on the left. The overall lighting is soft and diffused, creating realistic shadows and reflections.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instructions specify:
- Transform the **hot dog into a colorful LEGO model** using red, yellow, and tan bricks.
- Replace the **bottle with a mosaic-style ceramic piece** featuring geometric patterns matching the LEGO colors.
- Display both items on a **smooth wooden base**, maintaining the hot dog’s elongated structure but giving the bottle a rounded, artistic look for visual harmony.

From this:
- The **form and material** of the hot dog are to be changed (from real food to LEGO), so its physical composition is no longer fixed.
- The **bottle** is to be replaced entirely with a ceramic mosaic object, meaning its original shape, texture, and labeling are not required.
- The **scene environment** (wooden table, background, lighting) is not explicitly preserved, so changes are allowed.
- However, the instruction specifies **"maintaining the hot dog's elongated structure"** — indicating that while form changes, the **overall length and orientation** must remain consistent.
- It also says **"display both items on a smooth wooden base"** — suggesting the **presence of a wooden platform** should be retained, though its texture may change.

Thus, only **specific structural and positional features** are preserved by implication.

**Allowed Changes List:**
- Form and material of the hot dog (from meat to LEGO)
- Form and material of the bottle (from glass beverage container to ceramic mosaic)
- Labeling and branding on the bottle
- Texture and finish of the wooden surface (though “smooth wooden base” implies wood-like material)
- Background elements (window, plant, dishes, etc.)
- Color palette of the objects (as long as LEGO and mosaic use red, yellow, tan)
- Lighting and shadow effects

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
We now identify what **must be preserved** based on exclusion from the allowed changes list and logical necessity.

**Core recognition elements:**  
Although the hot dog and bottle are being transformed, the **instruction requires retaining the hot dog's elongated structure** — this is a critical clue. This means the **length, horizontal orientation, and general silhouette** of the hot dog must be preserved, even if made of LEGO. Similarly, the **position relative to the bottle** (side-by-side, on the same plane) is implied by "display both items." While the bottle is replaced, the **spatial relationship** between the two objects remains important for scene coherence.

**Functional/logical association elements:**  
There is no functional interaction between the objects, but their **placement on a shared wooden base** suggests a compositional logic: they are presented together as a meal pairing. Therefore, the **co-location on a flat surface** and **relative positioning** (hot dog to the right of the bottle) should be preserved for consistency.

**Non-modified element deduction:**  
While the bottle’s appearance changes, the **original position of the bottle** (upright, near the center-left) and the **hot dog’s placement on the cutting board** (slightly elevated, right side) are not mentioned as changing. Thus, **their spatial arrangement** — bottle on left, hot dog on right — should be maintained.

Additionally, although the materials change, the **orientation of the hot dog (horizontal)** and **its elongated form** are explicitly stated to be preserved, making them non-negotiable.

**Preservation Targets List:**
- The **horizontal orientation** of the hot dog
- The **overall elongated shape** of the hot dog
- The **side-by-side placement** of the bottle and hot dog
- The **positioning of the hot dog on a raised wooden surface** (cutting board or similar)
- The **relative spatial layout**: bottle on the left, hot dog on the right, both on a shared wooden base

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The elongated shape of the hot dog is explicitly required to be maintained in the editing instruction ("maintaining the hot dog's elongated structure"). This is a core structural feature that defines its identity as a hot dog in the context of the scene. If the LEGO version were shortened or curved significantly, it would lose its recognizability as a hot dog. Therefore, preserving the elongated form is essential for identity retention and visual consistency, warranting a weight of 3 points.
    Question: Is the hot dog represented as an elongated, straight object?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The horizontal orientation of the hot dog is fundamental to its presentation and alignment with typical serving style. The instruction does not allow rotation or vertical placement, implying it must remain horizontally aligned. Changing this would disrupt the intended composition and break continuity with the original image. This is a key spatial feature affecting scene logic, thus assigned 3 points.
    Question: Is the hot dog placed horizontally on the wooden base?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The instruction specifies displaying both items on a smooth wooden base. Although the original cutting board may be replaced, the presence of a wooden platform beneath both objects is required. This ensures continuity in the display surface and maintains the scene’s coherence. The material may change, but the existence of a flat, wooden-like support is necessary, making this an important environmental element worth 2 points.
    Question: Are both the hot dog and the bottle placed on a flat wooden surface?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The relative positioning of the bottle and hot dog — with the bottle on the left and the hot dog on the right — is implied by the original layout and the instruction to "display both items" together. Reversing or separating them would alter the composition significantly. While their forms change, their spatial relationship is essential for scene recognition and balance, hence a weight of 2 points.
    Question: Is the bottle positioned to the left of the hot dog?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The original hot dog rests on a cutting board, which is a distinct elevated surface. The instruction requires a "smooth wooden base," suggesting a similar raised platform. Even if the cutting board is replaced, the presence of a separate, slightly elevated surface under the hot dog must be preserved to maintain depth and realism in the scene. This detail supports the three-dimensional layout and is a secondary but coherent element, thus assigned 1 point.
    Question: Is the hot dog placed on a raised wooden platform distinct from the main table surface?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
