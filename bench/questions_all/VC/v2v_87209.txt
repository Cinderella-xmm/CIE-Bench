Description of reference image: The subject is an animated DVD case and CD for "Owlegories," featuring a prominent blue owl with large white eyes and a yellow beak. The owl is depicted holding a book, with smaller owls in various colors positioned below. The title "OWLEGORIES" is displayed prominently in bold white letters, along with the phrases "The Sun | The Seed | The Water." The background is a warm orange-yellow gradient, suggesting a sunset. The "SHOP NOW!" button is a green rectangular element placed over the image. The overall design is colorful and cartoonish.

### Step 1 - Allowed Changes List:

Thinking process: The instructions specify transforming the image into an Art Nouveau style, which involves changing the owl's appearance to include sinuous lines and botanical motifs, altering the typography to a whiplash script, and adjusting the background to organic, curvilinear patterns with earthy tones. The "SHOP NOW!" button is to be integrated delicately into the design. 

Allowed Changes List:
Specific element 1 that allows for changes: Owl's design, including lines, feathers, and botanical motifs.
Specific element 2 that allows for changes: Typography of "OWLEGORIES" and other text.
Specific element 3 that allows for changes: Background design and color scheme.
Specific element 4 that allows for changes: Integration and design of the "SHOP NOW!" button.

### Step 2 - Preservation Targets List:

Thinking process: Core recognition elements include the blue owl's distinctive features (eyes, beak, and general shape), the presence of the smaller owls, and the title "OWLEGORIES." Functional/logical elements include the relationship between the owl and the book, as well as the placement of the smaller owls. Remaining elements like the overall composition and the presence of the "SHOP NOW!" button should also be retained for visual coherence.

Preservation Targets List:
Element 1 that should be maintained: The blue owl's large white eyes and yellow beak.
Element 2 that should be maintained: The presence of the smaller owls.
Element 3 that should be maintained: The title "OWLEGORIES."
Element 4 that should be maintained: The owl holding a book.
