Description of reference image: The subject consists of two individuals, a man and a woman, standing in front of a neutral gray textured backdrop. The man has long, dark curly hair tied back into a low ponytail, a full beard, and is wearing a short-sleeved pinkish-red t-shirt with a subtle white geometric dot pattern, paired with plain dark gray pants. He stands slightly angled toward the camera, smiling, with his left hand in his pocket. The woman, positioned behind him, has her black hair styled in a long, twisted braid over her right shoulder. She wears an identical pinkish-red t-shirt with the same pattern, paired with high-waisted dark gray pleated pants featuring a wide waistband and a tie belt. Her arms are raised, hands gently resting on the man’s shoulders, and she looks at him with a soft expression. Both shirts have a crew neck design, and their outfits are coordinated in color and pattern. The lighting is even and studio-like, emphasizing natural skin tones and fabric textures. The background is a uniform mottled gray surface without any distinct features or decorations.

Thinking process:  
First, analyze the editing instructions word by word:  
- "Transform the outfits into chibi-style character costumes" → This indicates that the clothing style will be changed significantly to reflect a stylized, cartoonish aesthetic (chibi), implying changes in shape, proportion, and texture.  
- "For the male, create a plush 3D tee and pants with bold geometric pattern and enlarged collar details" → The original clothing will be replaced with a new design; thus, the original shirt's pattern and cut can change. However, the instruction does not mention altering the person’s identity or facial features.  
- "For the female, stylize her high-waisted pants with exaggerated pleats, and add charm by enlarging the top's sleeve" → Again, the clothing is to be modified, but no mention of changing body proportions or facial features.  
- "Display both designs as figurines dancing on a pastel-colored stage, conveying playful elegance" → This implies a complete scene transformation: the background will change from a gray studio wall to a pastel-colored stage, and the figures will be depicted as figurines in motion.  

Allowed Changes List:  
- Clothing design (including patterns, sleeves, collars, pants structure)  
- Proportions and styling of garments (e.g., enlarged sleeves, exaggerated pleats)  
- Background environment (from gray textured wall to pastel-colored stage)  
- Figure representation (from real people to chibi-style figurines)  
- Posture and movement (from static pose to dancing)  
- Lighting and atmosphere (to match playful elegance)  

Step 2 – Determine the elements that should remain unchanged  
Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements:  
- The identities of the two individuals (man and woman) must be preserved despite the transformation into figurines. Key visual identifiers include:  
  - The man’s long curly hair tied in a ponytail  
  - His facial features: beard, mustache, blue eyes, and earring in the left ear  
  - The woman’s long black braid, facial features (especially her eye shape and pink lipstick), and hairstyle  
  These are essential for recognizing the subjects as the same individuals. Changing them would result in unrecognizable characters.  

Functional/logical association elements:  
- The interaction between the two figures—her hands on his shoulders, his relaxed stance—is part of their relational posture. While the dance motion may change, the core dynamic (one person behind the other, hands on shoulders) should be retained in some form to maintain narrative continuity.  
- The coordination of their outfits (same color, same pattern) is a key visual link. Even if transformed, the matching nature of their clothes should be preserved to retain the sense of unity and design intention.  

Non-modified element deduction:  
- Elements not mentioned in the allowed changes must be retained unless they are logically implied to change. For example:  
  - The presence of the man’s silver hoop earring (left ear)  
  - The woman’s braided hairstyle and its direction (over right shoulder)  
  - The fact that both wear similar shirts with a specific dot pattern (even if the pattern becomes bold, the similarity must be maintained)  
  - The relative positioning of the figures (woman behind man)  
  These are not explicitly allowed to change and are crucial for identifying the original subjects.  

Preservation Targets List:  
- Man’s long curly hair in ponytail  
- Man’s facial hair (beard and mustache)  
- Man’s left ear silver hoop earring  
- Woman’s long black braid over right shoulder  
- Woman’s pink lipstick  
- Matching pinkish-red shirts with white dot pattern (though pattern may become bold, it must still be recognizable as the same base design)  
- Relative positioning: woman behind man, hands on his shoulders  
- Coordination of outfit colors and styles (both wear similar shirts and dark gray pants)  

Q1:  
Thinking process: The man’s long curly hair tied into a low ponytail is a defining physical trait that distinguishes him from other figures. It is a core identification feature; removing or altering it (e.g., making it short or straight) would make the figure unrecognizable. Therefore, this element must be preserved even in chibi form.  
Question: Is the man’s long curly hair tied into a low ponytail present?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The man’s silver hoop earring in his left ear is a distinctive accessory that contributes to his unique appearance. Its presence is critical for accurate identification. In chibi style, accessories may be simplified, but the earring must still be visible.  
Question: Is there a silver hoop earring visible in the man’s left ear?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The woman’s long black braid extending over her right shoulder is a key hairstyle identifier. It is visually prominent and helps distinguish her from others. Even in stylized form, the braid’s direction and length should be preserved.  
Question: Does the woman have a long black braid over her right shoulder?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The woman’s pink lipstick is a notable facial detail that adds to her distinct look. While makeup may be simplified in chibi art, the presence of pink lips is a key identifying feature.  
Question: Are the woman’s lips colored pink?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The matching pinkish-red shirts with a white dot pattern are central to the visual theme of the image. Even though the pattern may be exaggerated, the shared color and motif must be retained to preserve the intended design harmony.  
Question: Do both individuals wear shirts of the same pinkish-red color with a white dot pattern?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The woman’s hands are placed on the man’s shoulders, which defines their physical relationship and pose. This interaction is a core compositional element. Even in dancing figurine form, the gesture should be retained to maintain continuity.  
Question: Are the woman’s hands placed on the man’s shoulders?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The man’s beard and mustache are integral to his facial identity. Removing or altering them would fundamentally change his appearance. They must be preserved in any stylized version.  
Question: Does the man have a full beard and mustache?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q8:  
Thinking process: The dark gray pants worn by both individuals are part of their coordinated outfit. While the pants may be stylized, their color and general form (dark gray) should be retained to maintain visual consistency.  
Question: Do both individuals wear dark gray pants?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2
