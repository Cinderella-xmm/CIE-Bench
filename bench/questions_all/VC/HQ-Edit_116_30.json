      "thinking_process": "The central rose window is the most iconic feature of this cathedral type, especially in French Gothic architecture. Its presence, circular shape, and radiating tracery pattern are essential for identifying the structure as a major Gothic cathedral. If absent or replaced, the building loses its defining visual identity. This element is critical for recognition and thus carries maximum weight.",
      "question": "Is the large circular rose window located above the central portal and featuring intricate radial tracery?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The three main portals are fundamental to the façade’s composition and represent the primary entrance points. Their pointed arches and relative positioning define the horizontal symmetry of the structure. Altering their number or form would fundamentally change the architectural character. This is a core structural element, hence high weight.",
      "question": "Are there three distinct arched entrances at the base of the façade, arranged symmetrically with the central one being the largest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The twin spires flanking the central gable are signature vertical elements of Gothic cathedrals. They contribute to the upward thrust and visual balance. Their absence would make the structure appear incomplete or non-Gothic. While the material may change to wood, their form and placement must be preserved in the model.",
      "question": "Are there two tall, slender spires positioned symmetrically at the outer edges of the central gable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The symmetrical layout of the façade—including the alignment of portals, windows, and decorative elements—is a hallmark of Gothic cathedral design. This balance is crucial for architectural recognition. Even in a model, the mirrored arrangement must be maintained to preserve authenticity.",
      "question": "Is the façade symmetrically balanced around a central vertical axis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The detailed tracery and ornamental carvings—such as the patterns in the rose window, the columns, and the pinnacles—are key indicators of Gothic craftsmanship. While the material changes to wood, the design must remain faithful. Losing these details would reduce the model to a generic structure.",
      "question": "Are there visible intricate stone carvings, including tracery, pinnacles, and sculptural details, across the façade?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The flying buttresses and vertical shafts are functional and aesthetic features of Gothic architecture. Their presence supports the structure and contributes to its distinctive profile. Even in a model, they must be included to maintain architectural accuracy.",
      "question": "Are there flying buttresses extending from the sides of the nave toward the exterior walls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The triangular gable above the rose window is a standard feature in many Gothic façades. It frames the rose window and adds height to the central section. Its preservation ensures correct proportion and form in the model.",
      "question": "Is there a triangular gable directly above the central rose window?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "thinking_process": "The presence of multiple pinnacles along the roofline is a stylistic trait of Gothic cathedrals. While minor compared to larger elements, their inclusion adds authenticity and detail. They are not core but contribute to visual fidelity.",
      "question": "Are there multiple slender pinnacles rising from the roofline along the central and side sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
