Its presence, distribution, and relative position define the garment’s aesthetic and cultural specificity. If lost or replaced, the hanbok would lose its distinct identity. Since the instruction only allows accentuation with metallic foils, the **original pattern must remain visible and unaltered in placement**. This is a key identification element, so it receives a weight of 3 points.",

Changing these colors would result in a different cultural interpretation or misrepresentation. The instruction does not permit color change, only enhancement via metallic foils. Thus, the **base colors must be preserved**. This is a core identity feature, so it receives 3 points.",

It is a key structural detail that identifies the garment’s closure method. Although the instruction allows enlarging the bow, it does not allow removing or relocating it. Therefore, its **presence and central position** must be retained. This is a critical functional and aesthetic element, hence 3 points.",

Its architectural features — curved roofs, red pillars, green eaves — are iconic and distinguishable. Any loss of these features would break the contextual authenticity. While stylization is allowed, the **core silhouette and structural elements** must remain. This is a key scene element, so it receives 3 points.",
