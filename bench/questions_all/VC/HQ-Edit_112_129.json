      "thinking_process": "The central rose engraving is the most prominent and identifiable feature of the teapot's decorative design. It is located at the center of the body and is rendered with high detail, including layered petals and shading that give it depth. This specific floral motif is a core identifier of the teapot's artistic style and serves as a focal point. If this rose is removed, altered in shape, or replaced with another flower, the teapot’s distinctive character is lost. Therefore, preserving the exact form and position of the central rose is critical for identity retention, assigning it a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the central rose engraving present on the front of the teapot's body, with clearly defined layered petals and shaded depth?",

      "thinking_process": "The spout is a defining functional and structural component of the teapot, extending from the left side in a smooth, curved arc. Its shape and orientation are integral to the teapot’s silhouette and usability. Even if plants emerge from it, the spout’s original form must remain recognizable. Altering its curve or removing it would fundamentally change the object’s identity. As a key structural element, its preservation ensures continuity in form and function, warranting a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Does the spout extend from the left side of the teapot in a smooth, curved arc, maintaining its original shape and attachment point?",

      "thinking_process": "The handle is uniquely shaped with an ornate, swirling scroll design that distinguishes it from standard handles. This decorative flourish is a signature element of the teapot’s craftsmanship and contributes significantly to its visual identity. Changing its form or replacing it with a simpler design would diminish its elegance and recognizability. As a major structural and aesthetic feature, it must be retained, earning a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the handle on the right side of the teapot formed into an ornate, scrolled design with visible curls and decorative flourishes?",

      "thinking_process": "The lid is topped with a finial that resembles a stylized acorn or flame, which is a distinctive decorative element. This finial is not just a cap but a sculptural feature that completes the teapot’s crown-like appearance. Its absence or replacement would break the symmetry and visual harmony of the object. Since it is not mentioned for modification in the instructions, it must be preserved as a core identity marker, assigned a weight of 2 points due to its importance in completing the overall form.",
      "question": "Is there a decorative finial on top of the lid, shaped like a stylized acorn or flame motif?",

      "thinking_process": "The base of the teapot features a thin, ridged band with repeating geometric patterns, which is a subtle but important detail contributing to its crafted appearance. While not as prominent as the floral designs, this element adds authenticity and consistency to the teapot’s construction. It is part of the original design and not mentioned for alteration, so it must be preserved. Its loss would reduce the sense of completeness and craftsmanship, thus assigned a weight of 1 point as a minor but meaningful detail.",

      "thinking_process": "The floral engravings surrounding the central rose include detailed leaves and smaller flowers, forming a continuous botanical pattern. These secondary floral elements contribute to the richness of the design and help define the teapot’s ornate style. They are not individually highlighted in the instructions but are part of the original artwork. Their removal or simplification would disrupt the visual balance and reduce the level of detail that makes the teapot unique. As a supporting decorative feature, they are important enough to preserve, assigned a weight of 2 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The material appearance of the teapot, characterized by a polished, reflective metallic surface with visible highlights and shadows, is essential to its perceived texture and realism. Even if the color shifts to earth tones, the **presence of reflective qualities** and **metallic sheen** must be retained to preserve the original material impression. Without this, the teapot could appear made of wood or stone, losing its identity. This attribute is fundamental to its visual representation, hence assigned a weight of 2 points.",
      "question": "Does the teapot exhibit a polished, reflective metallic surface with visible highlights and shadows indicating a shiny material?",
