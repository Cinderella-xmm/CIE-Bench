### Step 1 - Analyzing Allowed Changes

**Description of Reference Image:**  
The subject is a small dog sitting upright, facing away from the viewer towards a glowing fire in the background. The dog has long, flowing fur with a mix of dark and light tones. Its ears are perked up, and it appears to be attentively observing the fire. To the left of the dog is a dark, rectangular pedestal. The background is dark with scattered sparks of orange light, creating a dramatic and moody atmosphere.

**Thinking Process:**  
The editing instructions specify transforming the dog into a chibi-style keychain held by a human hand. This means the dog's physical form, size, and context within the scene will change significantly. However, the instructions do not mention altering the background or the pedestal, implying these elements may remain unchanged unless specified otherwise.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
1. The dog's form can be changed to a chibi-style keychain with soft rubber material and thick black outlines.
2. The dog's size relative to other elements can be adjusted to fit the keychain scale.
3. The dog's connection to a tiny silver keyring can be added.
4. The background can be simplified to a plain and neutral setting.

### Step 2 - Determining Elements That Should Remain Unchanged

**Thinking Process:**  
Core recognition elements include the dog's unique fur pattern and coloration, which should be retained even in chibi form. Functional/logical association elements include the dog's posture and orientation toward the fire, which should be preserved in the keychain design. Remaining elements like the pedestal and background should also be retained for visual coherence.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
1. The dog's fur pattern and coloration.
2. The dog's posture and orientation toward the fire.
3. The presence of the pedestal.
4. The dark, moody background with scattered sparks.
