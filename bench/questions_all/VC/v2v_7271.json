      "thinking_process": "The \"LAUNDROMAT\" sign is the primary identifier of the scene. Its text content and placement above the entrance are essential for recognizing the location. If this sign is altered, removed, or obscured, the scene loses its defining context. The word \"LAUNDROMAT\" in white capital letters on a teal background is a unique visual feature that anchors the image’s identity. Therefore, preserving the exact text and its position is a core requirement with maximum weight.",
      "question": "Is the word \"LAUNDROMAT\" clearly visible in white capital letters on a teal background above the entrance?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The stack of folded laundry is the central object in the image and defines the subject’s activity. The specific sequence of six colors—light blue, dusty rose, white, mustard yellow, medium blue, and dark gray—is a distinctive visual pattern that must be preserved. Changing the order or omitting any layer would alter the scene’s narrative and visual integrity. This sequence is a key identifying feature of the original content.",
      "question": "Are there exactly six folded garments stacked in the following order from top to bottom: light blue, dusty rose, white, mustard yellow, medium blue, and dark gray?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The woman’s posture—standing upright, facing slightly left, and holding the laundry with both hands at waist level—is crucial for conveying the action. Her body orientation and hand placement support the narrative of carrying clean clothes. Altering this pose would disrupt the logical flow of the scene. While her facial expression may be stylized, her stance and grip on the laundry must remain consistent.",
      "question": "Is the woman standing in front of the laundromat with both hands supporting the stack of laundry from underneath at waist level?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The presence of washing machines visible through the glass door confirms the interior function of the building. Their circular drum doors and metallic appearance are characteristic of industrial laundry equipment. Removing or altering them would misrepresent the setting. Even in Lego form, their basic shape and placement must be retained to preserve the scene’s logic.",
      "question": "Are two washing machines visible through the glass door, one with a circular door and the other partially visible behind it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The brick wall on the left side of the image provides architectural context and helps define the building’s exterior. Its beige color and horizontal brick pattern contribute to the realism of the setting. While the texture may be simplified in Lego form, the wall’s presence and position relative to the woman and the entrance must be maintained for spatial consistency.",
      "question": "Is there a beige brick wall on the left side of the image, extending vertically behind the woman?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The woman’s clothing—rust-colored long-sleeve sweater and blue jeans—is part of her identity and contributes to the everyday realism of the scene. While the material may be replaced with Lego bricks, the color and cut of the clothing must remain recognizable. The sweater’s round neckline and three-quarter sleeve length, along with the jeans’ fit, are distinguishing features.",
      "question": "Is the woman wearing a rust-colored long-sleeve sweater and blue jeans?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The sidewalk in front of the laundromat is a minor environmental detail but contributes to the outdoor setting. Its light gray color and flat surface help ground the figure and provide depth. While it may be simplified in Lego form, its presence and position beneath the woman’s feet must be preserved for spatial coherence.",
      "question": "Is there a light gray concrete sidewalk visible in front of the laundromat, beneath the woman’s feet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
