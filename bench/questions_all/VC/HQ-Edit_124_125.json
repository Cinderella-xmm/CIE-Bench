      "thinking_process": "The Natarajasana pose is uniquely identified by the raised leg being held behind the back with both hands, while balancing on the opposite foot. This is the core functional and visual identifier of the pose. If the hands are not gripping the foot or the leg is not elevated, the pose is unrecognizable. This is a 3-point element because it defines the subject’s activity and purpose of the image.",
      "question": "Is the subject’s left leg raised and held behind her back with both hands?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The sun is positioned directly behind the figure, creating a strong silhouette and golden backlight. This is a key compositional element that anchors the scene and establishes time (sunset). Removing or repositioning the sun would fundamentally alter the atmosphere and visual balance. Its placement relative to the subject is essential.",
      "question": "Is the sun located directly behind the subject’s torso, forming a halo-like glow around her silhouette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "thinking_process": "The wet sandy beach with visible reflections of the sun and water is a defining environmental feature. It provides grounding for the pose and connects the figure to the natural setting. Stylization can occur, but the reflective surface must remain to preserve the sense of dampness and time of day.",
      "question": "Is the beach surface visibly wet, showing reflections of the sun and ocean waves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The two distant rock formations—one on the left, one on the right—are key landscape markers that establish depth and symmetry. Their presence helps frame the scene. While their shape may be stylized, their existence and approximate positions must be retained to maintain spatial coherence.",
      "question": "Are there two distinct rocky landforms visible in the background, one on the left and one on the right side of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The subject’s bare feet are essential to the authenticity of the yoga practice. Wearing footwear would contradict the typical depiction of yoga and affect the pose’s balance. The foot must be planted firmly on the sand.",
      "question": "Is the subject standing barefoot on the sand, with the sole of her right foot flat against the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The bun hairstyle is a clear identifier of the subject’s appearance. While cartoonization may simplify it, the presence of a bun is necessary to maintain continuity with the original character. A different hairstyle (e.g., loose hair) would make the figure visually distinct.",
      "question": "Is the subject’s hair tied into a neat bun at the back of her head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The upward tilt of the head and closed eyes contribute to the serene expression required by the yoga theme. While facial features may be simplified, the direction of the gaze (upward) must remain to convey tranquility and focus.",
      "question": "Is the subject’s head tilted upward, with her face angled toward the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The ocean waves rolling toward the shore are a key element of the beach environment. They provide motion and context. Even if stylized, the presence of waves approaching the shore must be preserved.",
      "question": "Are there visible ocean waves breaking along the shoreline in front of the subject?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
