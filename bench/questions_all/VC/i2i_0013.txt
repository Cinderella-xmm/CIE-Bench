Description of reference image: The subject is Albert Einstein, instantly recognizable by his distinctively white, disheveled hair and expressive facial features. He is sticking his tongue out in a playful manner, wearing a dark suit and tie. The backdrop is entirely black, emphasizing the subject’s face and expression. His iconic posture, expression, and casual demeanor are central to the image's impact.

### Step 1 - Allowed Changes List

Thinking process:  
The editing instructions require transforming the subject into a kawaii enamel pin. This means the form, texture, and some stylistic aspects may be altered, such as replacing realistic skin tones with glossy metal outlines and filling in areas with vibrant enamel colors. The square mockup format and white background indicate a clear shift in scene and layout. However, these changes should not alter the core identity of the subject.

Allowed Changes List:  
- Change the form from a photograph to a kawaii enamel pin style.  
- Introduce glossy metal outlines and vibrant enamel fills.  
- Format the image into a square mockup.  
- Replace the black background with a white one.  

### Step 2 - Preservation Targets List

Thinking process:  
Based on the iconic and unique features of Einstein, such as his hair, expression (tongue out), and recognizable pose, these elements are central to his identity. Functional elements, like the interaction of his expression with the viewer, contribute to the overall message and should thus be retained. Remaining visual coherence factors, such as his face shape and attire, support recognition and must also be preserved.

Preservation Targets List:  
- Einstein's disheveled white hair  
- Tongue-out expression  
- Face shape and proportions  
- Suit and tie attire  
- Overall playful demeanor
