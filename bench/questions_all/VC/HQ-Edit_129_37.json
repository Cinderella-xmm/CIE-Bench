      "thinking_process": "The presence of the **cardinal direction labels (N, E, S, W)** is a core identification feature of any compass. These letters are clearly visible in the original image and define the compass’s navigational function. If they are omitted or replaced in the transformed design, the object would no longer be recognizable as derived from a compass. Since the instruction requires the compass face to be preserved as an embossed pattern, these labels must remain intact in form and position. Their loss would fundamentally alter the identity of the source object, making this a high-weight element.",
      "question": "Are the cardinal direction labels N, E, S, and W clearly visible and correctly positioned on the embossed compass face of the perfume bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The **degree markings (0–360°)** along the outer ring are another defining characteristic of the compass. They provide precision and are integral to its functionality. The instruction specifies retaining the compass face as an embossed pattern, which includes all its original markings. Removing or distorting these numbers would compromise the authenticity of the transformation and break the connection to the original object. This is a key structural and functional detail, hence high weight.",
      "question": "Is the full 360-degree scale with numerical markings (e.g., 0, 90, 180, 270) present and evenly spaced around the outer edge of the embossed compass face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The **radial star-like pattern** with multiple arms extending from the center is a distinctive visual motif of the compass face. It represents the wind rose or directional indicator. This pattern is central to the compass’s aesthetic and symbolic identity. Even though the needle is replaced by a nozzle, the underlying star design must remain unaltered in structure and symmetry to preserve the original look. Its absence would make the transformation unrecognizable as originating from the original compass.",
      "question": "Does the embossed compass face retain the original eight-pointed star-like radial pattern with symmetrical arms extending from the center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The **circular shape** of the compass is fundamental to its identity. The instruction specifies a \"circular glass container,\" confirming the shape is preserved. Any deviation in shape (e.g., oval, square) would violate the transformation logic and lose the core visual identity. While material changes, the **roundness and proportional dimensions** must remain consistent. This is a structural core element.",
      "question": "Is the body of the perfume bottle perfectly circular in shape, matching the original compass’s outline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The **cartographic patterns** from the map fragments — particularly the compass rose and gridded lines — are referenced in the cap design. These are not just decorative but serve as thematic anchors linking the perfume bottle to the original scene. Although the fragments themselves may not appear, their **visual motifs must be replicated** in the cap’s engraving. Losing these would disconnect the new object from the original context and reduce thematic coherence.",
      "question": "Does the cap of the perfume bottle feature engraved cartographic details such as a compass rose and intersecting grid lines, matching those seen on the map fragments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The **central pivot point** where the needle was originally mounted is a key structural detail. In the original, it is a small metallic knob. The instruction replaces the needle with a spray nozzle, but the **position and appearance of the central hub** are likely preserved as part of the embossed design. Its removal or relocation would disrupt the symmetry and visual integrity of the compass face. Though not the most critical, it contributes to fidelity.",
      "question": "Is there a small central raised dot or hub at the exact center of the embossed compass face, corresponding to the original needle pivot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The **outer ring with measurement markings** (degrees and directional labels) must be preserved as part of the embossed pattern. The instruction specifies the compass face is retained, so the **ring’s width, texture, and labeling** must remain consistent. Any distortion or omission would affect readability and recognition. This is a minor but necessary detail for visual accuracy.",
      "question": "Is the outer ring of the embossed compass face clearly delineated with fine engravings and consistent spacing between degree marks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
