      "thinking_process": "The halo is a critical iconographic element identifying the figure as divine or angelic. Its absence or alteration (e.g., shape, position, luminosity) would fundamentally change the subject's identity. Since the instruction does not mention removing or changing the halo, it must be preserved. The halo’s presence above the head in a circular form is a unique identifier of this angelic figure.",
      "question": "Is there a faint circular halo floating above the angel’s head?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The wings are essential to the angelic identity. Even though gold accents are added, the wings' existence, size, and attachment to the back must remain. Their symmetrical spread and feathered structure are key visual identifiers. Removing or drastically altering their form would make the figure no longer recognizable as an angel.",
      "question": "Are there large, fully extended feathered wings visible behind the figure, symmetrically positioned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The blue eyes are a defining facial feature of the original subject. They contribute to the angel’s serene and ethereal expression. Changing eye color or removing them would alter the identity of the figure, especially since the original has distinct blue irises. This is a core recognition element tied to the subject’s visual identity.",
      "question": "Does the angel have bright blue eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The hand placement near the chest is part of the figure’s pose and emotional expression. It suggests introspection or reverence, contributing to the narrative. Although the garment may change, the hand’s position relative to the body must remain consistent to preserve the original gesture and posture.",
      "question": "Is the right hand placed near the chest or shoulder area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The long, wavy, golden-blonde hair is a distinctive trait of the figure. While lighting may affect appearance, the hair’s color, length, and flow are key to recognizing the subject. Altering these would change the visual identity significantly, even if the style is transformed.",
      "question": "Does the figure have long, wavy, golden-blonde hair that flows over the shoulders and back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The overall body orientation—slightly turned toward the viewer—is crucial for maintaining the original composition and gaze direction. A complete frontal or profile view would disrupt the intended perspective and emotional connection. This spatial relationship is part of the figure’s identity in the original image.",
      "question": "Is the figure positioned slightly turned toward the viewer, with the face angled forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
