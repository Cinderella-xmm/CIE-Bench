      "thinking_process": "The orange and black wing pattern with black veins and white marginal spots is the key identifier of the monarch butterfly. This specific arrangement allows for immediate recognition of the species. Even if sheet music patterns are overlaid, the underlying wing structure must remain intact to maintain species identity. Loss of this pattern would render the butterfly unrecognizable as a monarch.",
      "question": "Are the orange fields with black veins and white spots along the wing margins present in the butterfly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The white spots along the outer edges of both forewings and hindwings are unique to the monarch butterfly and distinguish it from similar species. Their presence is critical for accurate identification. Even with artistic modifications, these spots must remain visible and correctly positioned.",
      "question": "Are there clearly defined white spots located along the outer edge of both forewings and hindwings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The black body with white speckles is a defining feature of the monarch butterfly’s thorax and abdomen. It contributes to species-specific appearance and must be preserved even if stylized. Altering this could result in misidentification.",
      "question": "Is the butterfly’s body black with small white speckles distributed across it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The flower beneath the butterfly must retain the morphological characteristics of a coneflower (Echinacea), including a central spiky cone and drooping petals. Although the instruction calls for multiple flowers, the original flower type must be preserved as a foundational element in the scene. Losing this botanical identity would break continuity with the original image.",
      "question": "Is there a flower with a spiky central cone and drooping petals beneath the butterfly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The relative position of the butterfly above the flower is essential for maintaining ecological plausibility and compositional coherence. Even with animation and circular flow, the butterfly must remain positioned atop the bloom to preserve logical interaction.",
      "question": "Is the butterfly positioned directly above the flower, with its legs touching the bloom?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
