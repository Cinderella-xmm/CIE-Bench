### Step 1 - Description of Reference Image and Allowed Changes List:

**Description of Reference Image:**  
The subject is a panda depicted as a mage, sitting atop a white horse. The panda is dressed in a dark, hooded robe and holds a glowing staff. The horse is calm and stands still, facing forward. The background features a brick wall with a vibrant, swirling design and the word "HARMONY" prominently displayed in stylized lettering. The overall tone is mystical and harmonious.

**Thinking Process:**  
The editing instructions specify transforming the image into a 3D cartoon style with soft lighting and adding RPG elements like skill bars and a nameplate. The scene's mystical and harmonious theme should be retained, but the background and some scene elements can be altered to fit the new style.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
1. Convert the image to a 3D cartoon style with soft lighting.  
2. Add RPG elements such as skill bars and a nameplate.  
3. Adjust the background to align with the magical and harmonious theme while keeping the "HARMONY" banner.  
4. Modify the horse and panda's proportions, angles, and positions slightly to fit the new style.

### Step 2 - Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged:

**Thinking Process:**  
Core recognition elements include the panda's distinctive black-and-white fur pattern, the glowing staff, and the "HARMONY" banner. Functional/logical elements include the panda riding the horse and holding the staff. Remaining elements like the robe's general shape and the horse's white coat should also be retained for visual coherence.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
1. Panda's black-and-white fur pattern.  
2. Glowing staff held by the panda.  
3. "HARMONY" banner in the background.  
4. The panda riding the horse.  
5. General shape of the robe.
