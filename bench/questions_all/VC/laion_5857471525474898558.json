      "thinking_process": "The vertical alignment of windows across the floors is a core architectural feature of this Amsterdam-style building. Its regular spacing and consistent height intervals create a rhythmic pattern essential to identifying the building’s design. Even when transformed into LEGO, the **vertical stacking of windows** must remain in the same relative positions to preserve the building’s identity. This is a key structural identifier, and altering it would make the structure unrecognizable as the original. Hence, it is assigned 3 points.",
      "question": "Are the windows aligned vertically in the same columns across all floors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The red wooden door on the ground floor is a distinct visual marker, both in color and placement. It is located on the left side of the building and serves as a primary entrance. Its position relative to the other door and windows defines the building’s frontage. Changing its location or omitting it would disrupt the building’s recognizable façade. Thus, its **presence and position** are critical and must be preserved, even if its material becomes LEGO. This makes it a high-weight retention element.",
      "question": "Is there a red door located on the left side of the ground floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The dark gray door on the right side of the ground floor complements the red door and completes the dual-entrance design typical of such buildings. Its presence ensures functional symmetry and architectural balance. Removing or relocating it would break the logical structure of the building’s entry system. While the material may change, its **position and existence** must remain intact. This is a key functional and visual element, thus weighted at 3 points.",
      "question": "Is there a dark-colored door located on the right side of the ground floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The climbing ivy grows vertically along the central portion of the building, covering several windows and balconies. Although the instruction allows replacing it with LEGO vines, the **path and coverage area** of the ivy must remain consistent to maintain visual continuity and architectural character. The location of the greenery is a defining aesthetic feature, and its absence or misplacement would alter the building’s appearance significantly. Therefore, its **location and extent** are important retention targets, assigned 2 points.",
      "question": "Does the climbing plant cover the central vertical strip of the building, spanning from near the ground floor up to the third floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The red rectangle drawn around a specific section of the building (containing three windows and a balcony) is a deliberate annotation in the original image. It highlights a particular area of interest, possibly for real estate or architectural analysis. Since it is part of the original composition and not mentioned in the editing instructions as removable, it must be preserved in its exact position and shape. Losing it would remove a key contextual clue. This is a minor but significant detail, hence weighted at 2 points.",
      "question": "Is there a red rectangular outline enclosing a section of the building that includes three stacked windows and a balcony?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The balconies are positioned directly outside certain windows, forming a consistent pattern across the building. Their **relative placement** to the windows they serve is crucial for maintaining architectural logic. Even if the railings become LEGO-style, the balconies must remain attached to the same windows to preserve structural coherence. This spatial relationship is essential for functionality and recognition, making it a 2-point retention element.",
      "question": "Are the balconies located directly outside specific windows on the second, third, and fourth floors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
