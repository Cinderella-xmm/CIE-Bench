**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a wide-angle daytime view of the Champ de Mars in Paris, featuring the Eiffel Tower prominently on the right side of the frame. The tower is depicted in its full height with its iconic wrought-iron lattice structure, including visible arches at the base, observation decks, and a pointed spire at the top. Its color is dark brown with subtle blue-tinted glass panels in the central shaft. To the left, a long row of uniformly trimmed green hedges forms a symmetrical avenue extending into the distance, flanked by black lampposts with classic lanterns. A sandy pathway runs through the center, leading toward the tower. People are scattered throughout the scene—some walking along the path, others sitting on benches or grassy areas. The sky is bright blue with scattered white cumulus clouds, and the sun shines brightly in the upper-left quadrant, creating a starburst effect. The lighting casts soft shadows consistent with midday.

Thinking process:  
The editing instructions specify transforming the image into a travel-themed infographic titled "Parisian Park Etiquette." The core directive is to **integrate visual elements** from the original image (Eiffel Tower, trim hedges) while restructuring the layout using the pathway as a central guide. Specific additions include stylized icons for seating, speech bubbles, and camera symbols. The design calls for cool green tones and clean typography, suggesting aesthetic changes but not structural removals of key features.

Allowed changes are explicitly defined:
- **Layout transformation**: The image will be split vertically along the pathway.
- **Addition of graphic elements**: Stylized icons (seating, speech bubbles, camera), text overlays.
- **Styling adjustments**: Use of cool greens, silhouettes, clean fonts.
- **Modification of human figures**: Addition of communication lines, stylization into silhouettes.
- **Symbolic integration**: Camera icon incorporating Eiffel Tower shape.

However, the instructions **do not** state that any of the following should be removed or fundamentally altered:
- The Eiffel Tower’s presence and form
- The hedge-lined avenue
- The central pathway
- The general spatial relationship between these elements

Therefore, only **non-core compositional elements** may be changed—such as people's postures, clothing details, and background textures—while **core structural and iconic elements must remain visually intact**.

**Allowed Changes List:**
(Specific element 1 that allows for changes): Human figures’ clothing and poses (e.g., turning them into stylized silhouettes)
(Specific element 2 that allows for changes): Background texture and shading (to support cool green tone)
(Specific element 3 that allows for changes): Addition of speech bubbles, seating icons, camera graphics
(Specific element 4 that allows for changes): Typography and text placement
(Specific element 5 that allows for changes): Lighting contrast and color balance (within cool green palette)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements are essential for identifying the location and authenticity of the scene. The Eiffel Tower is an internationally recognized landmark; altering its structure would undermine identity. Similarly, the geometrically precise hedge rows define the park’s formal layout—a hallmark of Parisian garden design. These are not merely decorative but functional components of the scene’s logic.

Functional/logical association elements include:
- The **pathway’s alignment** with the hedges and tower: it serves as a visual axis guiding perspective and depth. Removing or distorting this would break spatial coherence.
- The **relative positions** of the tower, hedges, and people: they establish scale and context. Changing their spatial relationships would misrepresent the actual environment.

Non-modified element deduction:  
All other elements not listed in the allowed changes list—such as the **specific shape of the Eiffel Tower’s lattice**, the **uniform cubic form of the hedges**, the **position of the sun**, and **the lampposts along the path**—must be preserved because:
- They are present in the original image.
- They are not mentioned as changeable.
- Their alteration would violate visual consistency and real-world plausibility.

Preservation Targets List:  
(Element 1 that should be maintained): The Eiffel Tower’s full structure, including its lattice framework, arches, and spire  
(Element 2 that should be maintained): The linear arrangement of uniformly shaped, cube-like green hedges forming a symmetrical avenue  
(Element 3 that should be maintained): The central sandy pathway running straight from foreground to background, aligned with the hedges and tower  
(Element 4 that should be maintained): The position and starburst effect of the sun in the upper-left quadrant of the sky  
(Element 5 that should be maintained): The black lampposts with classic lanterns placed at regular intervals along the pathway  
(Element 6 that should be maintained): The presence of people in natural poses within the park setting (not replaced by abstract icons unless overlaid)

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The Eiffel Tower’s lattice structure is its defining architectural feature. Its intricate ironwork, especially the triangular supports and arched base, is globally recognizable. Altering this would make the tower unidentifiable as the real Eiffel Tower. This is a core identity element, so losing it would destroy the image’s referential value. Hence, the question focuses on the **presence and structural integrity** of the tower’s iconic framework.
    Question: Is the Eiffel Tower’s full lattice structure, including its three-tiered arches and pointed spire, clearly visible and structurally accurate?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The precisely trimmed, cube-shaped hedges are a signature feature of the Champ de Mars gardens. Their uniformity and alignment create a strong visual rhythm and define the park’s formal character. Any deviation in shape or spacing would break the symmetry and misrepresent the location. Thus, preserving their **geometric form and spacing** is critical for scene authenticity.
    Question: Are the hedges arranged in a straight line with consistent cubic shapes and even spacing along the left side of the pathway?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The central pathway acts as a visual anchor, connecting the foreground to the Eiffel Tower in the background. It establishes depth and perspective. If the pathway is distorted or redirected, the spatial logic collapses. Therefore, its **linear continuity and alignment** with the hedges and tower must be preserved.
    Question: Does the sandy pathway extend directly from the foreground toward the Eiffel Tower, maintaining a straight trajectory without bends or interruptions?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The sun’s position in the upper-left quadrant with a distinct starburst effect is a key environmental detail contributing to the scene’s realism and mood. It affects shadow direction and highlights. While lighting can be adjusted, moving the sun or removing the starburst would alter the time-of-day perception and reduce fidelity. Thus, the **sun’s location and radiance pattern** are important for consistency.
    Question: Is the sun located in the upper-left portion of the sky with a clear starburst effect radiating outward?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The lampposts with classic lanterns are recurring elements along the pathway, reinforcing the historical and urban character of the park. Their regular placement contributes to the sense of order. While they may be stylized slightly, removing or repositioning them would disrupt the scene’s authenticity. Hence, their **presence and interval pattern** are significant secondary details.
    Question: Are black lampposts with traditional lanterns evenly spaced along both sides of the pathway?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The presence of people in natural poses (walking, sitting) grounds the scene in reality and provides scale. While some may be stylized into silhouettes per the infographic design, their **original positioning and interaction with the environment** must remain intact beneath any overlay. Removing all people or relocating them drastically would misrepresent the park atmosphere.
    Question: Are there multiple individuals visible in the park, positioned naturally along the path and grassy areas, interacting with the environment?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
