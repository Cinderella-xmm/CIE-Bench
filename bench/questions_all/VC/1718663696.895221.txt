Description of reference image:  
The subject is a male historical figure depicted in a 3D-rendered portrait style, with white powdered wig styled in an 18th-century fashion, featuring curls at the sides and back. He has a composed facial expression, with light skin tone, blue eyes, and a slight smile. He wears an ornate military-style uniform consisting of a deep navy blue coat with gold embroidery, including braided epaulettes on the shoulders, gold buttons arranged in vertical rows, and decorative gold trim along the collar, cuffs, and front closure. A white cravat with ruffled lace is visible at the neck. Over his right shoulder, a gold-embroidered sash crosses diagonally across the chest, fastened with a small insignia or medallion. He holds a golden staff in his right hand, topped with a stylized flame that appears to be burning with realistic orange and yellow fire, emitting sparks. The staff has intricate carvings resembling floral or leaf motifs near the top. His left arm hangs by his side, partially visible. The background features a soft-focus natural landscape with muted mountain silhouettes under a pale blue sky with scattered clouds, suggesting a high-altitude or open wilderness setting. The lighting is bright and even, highlighting the textures of the uniform and the glow of the flame.

Thinking process:  
First, analyze the editing instructions word by word to determine what elements are allowed to change. The instruction specifies transforming the image into a "digital character card styled like an RPG collectible," which implies significant reformatting of the overall composition—adding stat bars, title banners, nameplates, crests, and framing. However, it explicitly states: "Render the character in a heroic 3D illustration, highlighting the ornate blue-and-gold uniform and fiery staff." This means the **uniform** and **staff** must be preserved in their core form and visual characteristics. The instruction also says "Include a title banner... a nameplate... majestic battlefield backdrop with soft mountain silhouettes"—indicating the **background mountains** are to be retained (though possibly enhanced), but not necessarily the exact sky or cloud patterns. The phrase "highlighting the ornate blue-and-gold uniform" confirms that color, material texture, and design details of the clothing must remain consistent. The **flame on the staff** is described as central to the character's identity ("Flame Commander of Liberty"), so its presence and appearance should be preserved. The instruction does not mention changing the **subject’s face**, **wig**, or **posture**, so these are implicitly protected. The **sash**, **buttons**, **epaulettes**, and **cravat** are part of the uniform and thus fall under the "ornate blue-and-gold" description, so they must remain. The **golden staff** is a key prop; its shape, flame, and craftsmanship are essential. The **mountain silhouette** is mentioned as part of the new backdrop, so it must be retained in some form.

Allowed Changes List:  
- Overall composition (to fit RPG card format)  
- Addition of stat bars, title banner, crest emblem, nameplate, and bronze frame  
- Background enhancement to include a "majestic battlefield" while retaining mountain silhouettes  
- Lighting adjustments for dramatic effect within the RPG style  
- Frame border design (burnished bronze edges)  
- Visual effects such as glowing text or particle effects around stats  

Step 2 - Determine the elements that should remain unchanged  
Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements: The subject is clearly intended to represent a historical figure (likely George Washington), identifiable by the powdered wig, facial features, and colonial-era military attire. The **white powdered wig** is a defining feature of this era and person, and its shape and placement are critical for identification. The **blue-and-gold uniform** is iconic in American revolutionary imagery and serves as a primary identifier. The **golden staff with flame** is newly introduced but is now central to the character’s identity as “Flame Commander of Liberty”—its presence and structure are essential. The **gold sash** and **epaulettes** are standard military insignia and contribute to the authoritative look. Functional/logical association elements: The **staff is held in the right hand**, and its position relative to the body must be maintained to preserve the action logic. The **sash crosses from right shoulder to left hip**, which is a fixed structural element. Non-modified element deduction: Elements not mentioned in the allowed changes—such as the **exact facial expression**, **cravat detail**, **button arrangement**, **texture of fabric**, **color of uniform**, **flame shape**, and **mountain silhouette**—must be retained unless explicitly overridden. Even though the background will be altered, the **soft mountain silhouettes** are specified to be included, so their general form must remain.

Preservation Targets List:  
- The white powdered wig with curled ends  
- The deep navy blue uniform with gold trim  
- The gold-embroidered sash crossing from right shoulder to left hip  
- The golden staff with flame-shaped top and detailed carvings  
- The flame atop the staff, appearing as a dynamic orange-yellow fire  
- The facial features including blue eyes, slight smile, and light skin tone  
- The ruffled white cravat at the neck  
- The gold buttons arranged vertically on the front of the coat  
- The epaulettes on the shoulders with braided gold threads  
- The mountain silhouettes in the background  

Q1:  
Thinking process: The white powdered wig is a core identity feature of the historical figure depicted, especially in 18th-century portraiture. Its specific shape—curled at the sides and back, with a high forehead and voluminous back—is unique and essential for recognition. Changing its style or removing it would make the figure unidentifiable. Therefore, it is a key visual element with a weight of 3 points.  
Question: Is the white powdered wig with curled ends present on the figure's head?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The deep navy blue color of the uniform is a signature element of the historical military attire associated with the figure. It is paired with gold trim, forming a distinct visual contrast. Altering the base color would fundamentally change the identity of the outfit and disrupt historical accuracy. Thus, the color is a core recognition feature, warranting a weight of 3 points.  
Question: Is the uniform predominantly deep navy blue with gold embroidery?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The golden staff is a central prop introduced in the edit, symbolizing the "Flame Commander of Liberty." Its presence and form—especially the flame-shaped top—are crucial to the character’s identity. Removing or altering its shape would break the thematic connection. Hence, its existence and design are core to the concept, earning a weight of 3 points.  
Question: Is the golden staff with a flame-shaped top being held in the right hand?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The flame atop the staff is a functional and symbolic element representing "Fire Mastery" and liberty. Its appearance—dynamic, orange-yellow, with visible sparks—must be preserved to maintain the magical or heroic quality implied in the RPG context. Losing this would undermine the character’s theme. Therefore, it is a key visual element with a weight of 3 points.  
Question: Is there a visible, dynamic flame with orange and yellow hues at the top of the staff?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The gold sash crossing diagonally from the right shoulder to the left hip is a structural and symbolic element of military rank and authority. Its position and color are integral to the uniform’s design. Changing its path or color would disrupt the visual balance and historical authenticity. As a major accessory, it earns a weight of 2 points.  
Question: Does the gold sash cross from the right shoulder to the left hip?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The ruffled white cravat at the neck is a distinctive detail of 18th-century formal wear. While not as central as the wig or uniform, it contributes to the period accuracy and completeness of the portrayal. Its absence would reduce visual coherence. It is a minor but important detail, so it receives a weight of 1 point.  
Question: Is there a white ruffled cravat visible at the neck?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The mountain silhouettes in the background are explicitly required in the instruction ("majestic battlefield backdrop with soft mountain silhouettes"). Their presence establishes the setting and mood. Although the background may be enhanced, the basic silhouette shape must be retained. This is an important environmental element, so it is assigned a weight of 2 points.  
Question: Are soft mountain silhouettes visible in the background?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q8:  
Thinking process: The gold buttons arranged vertically down the front of the coat are a key design feature of the uniform. They are both decorative and functional, contributing to the structured appearance. Their pattern and placement must be preserved for consistency. This is a detail-level element, so it gets a weight of 1 point.  
Question: Are there multiple gold buttons arranged vertically on the front of the coat?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q9:  
Thinking process: The epaulettes on the shoulders with braided gold threads are part of the military rank insignia. Their presence and design contribute to the authoritative look of the figure. While not as critical as the uniform color, they are important for authenticity. This is a secondary detail, so it receives a weight of 1 point.  
Question: Are there gold epaulettes with braided threads on the shoulders?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1
