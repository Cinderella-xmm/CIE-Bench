Description of reference image: The subject is a tiger wearing a military-style cap, holding a skateboard with a yin-yang symbol on its underside. The tiger has a detailed and realistic depiction, showcasing its stripes, whiskers, and intense gaze. The skateboard is held firmly in the tiger's paws, and the background consists of a cloudy, monochromatic sky, giving the image a somber and dramatic tone.

Specific element 3 that allows for changes:  
A romantic floral arch can be added in the distance.  

Specific element 4 that allows for changes:  
The lighting and textures of the new environment can be adjusted to appear photorealistic.  

Specific element 5 that allows for changes:

### Step 2 - Preservation Targets List:

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements include the tiger's stripes and the skateboard's yin-yang symbol, as these are iconic identifiers. Functional/logical elements include the tiger holding the skateboard, as this action supports the narrative. Remaining elements like the military cap and the tiger's general posture contribute to visual coherence.
