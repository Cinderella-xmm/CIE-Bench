**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a brown leather wallet with visible stitching, placed flat on a neutral gray background. The wallet is open at the top, revealing multiple banknotes partially protruding from it. The banknotes include:  
- A U.S. $20 bill (green and white, featuring the number "20" in blue and green ink, with intricate architectural designs).  
- A Qatari Riyal note (orange and pinkish tone, with Arabic script and a serial number “103 01” visible).  
- An Indian Rupee note (yellow-brown color, featuring a lion capital of Ashoka’s pillar and the denomination “50” in Hindi and English).  
- A U.S. $1 bill (visible portion shows the number “1” and the portrait of George Washington).  
The wallet has a flap closure secured by a leather strap with a snap button, and the edges are stitched with contrasting thread. The leather surface exhibits natural grain texture, slight wear, and variation in tone due to aging or use. The lighting is soft and even, casting a subtle shadow beneath the wallet.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction explicitly states:  
- Transform the image into an **educational infographic** titled *"Currencies of the World."*  
- Use a **clean, modern design** with sections labeled **“USD,” “QAR,” and “INR”** for the visible banknotes.  
- Adjust the **wallet to a schematic blueprint**, outlining a **sleek, minimalist style** with **annotations next to each currency slot**.  
- Add **chart data illustrating exchange rates** and **icons representing each country’s economy**.

From this, we deduce:  
- The **form of the wallet** must change from realistic leather object to a **schematic blueprint** — thus, its material, texture, and physical realism are allowed to be changed.  
- The **banknotes themselves** are not to be removed but reorganized under labeled sections; their **denomination, country origin, and visual identity** must remain recognizable.  
- The **scene environment** (background) is not required to be preserved — it can be replaced with a clean infographic layout.  
- **Annotations, charts, and icons** are new elements introduced and are not part of the original image.  

Thus, only the **core identity features** of the banknotes and their **functional relationship** (being stored in a wallet) must be retained, while the **physical form of the wallet** and **background** are allowed to change.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
- Wallet’s physical appearance (material, texture, stitching, color, flap design)  
- Background (neutral gray surface)  
- Lighting and shadows  
- Overall composition and layout (to fit infographic format)  
- Addition of text labels, charts, icons, and annotations  
- Transformation of wallet into schematic blueprint style

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
We now identify what **must not be changed** based on exclusion from the allowed changes list and core recognition logic:

1. **Core recognition elements**:  
   - The **specific currencies** shown must remain identifiable. Each banknote has unique visual identifiers:
     - **U.S. $20 bill**: Green color, large numeral "20", architectural imagery (White House), and "TWENTY DOLLARS" text.
     - **Qatari Riyal**: Pink-orange hue, Arabic script, serial number “103 01”, and distinct watermark-like patterns.
     - **Indian Rupee 50**: Yellow-brown tone, lion capital of Ashoka, "₹50" in Devanagari and English, and the Reserve Bank of India seal.
     - **U.S. $1 bill**: Portrait of George Washington, "ONE DOLLAR" text, and the number "1".
   - These **currency-specific designs** are essential for identifying the content of the infographic. Even if stylized, they must retain enough visual fidelity to be recognized.

2. **Functional/logical association elements**:  
   - The **presence of three distinct currencies** (USD, QAR, INR) in the wallet implies a cross-currency context — this logical function supports the educational theme. Thus, the **set of three currencies** must remain intact.
   - The **relative position of notes** (e.g., USD $20 prominent, QAR and INR adjacent) may be rearranged, but the **fact that all three are present** must be preserved.

3. **Non-modified element deduction**:  
   - While the wallet becomes a blueprint, the **original banknotes' denominations and national identities** must not be altered. For example, changing the QAR note to a UAE Dirham would violate the original content.
   - The **color scheme and key design motifs** (like the lion capital on the INR note or the White House on the $20) must be retained even if simplified.

Thus, the **core visual features of the banknotes** — including their **colors, numerals, symbols, and national identifiers** — must be preserved.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
- The presence of a U.S. $20 bill with green color and "20" numeral  
- The presence of a Qatari Riyal note with pink-orange tone and serial number “103 01”  
- The presence of an Indian Rupee 50 note with yellow-brown color and lion capital symbol  
- The presence of a U.S. $1 bill with George Washington portrait and "ONE DOLLAR" text  
- The fact that these four notes are grouped together as currency samples

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The U.S. $20 bill is a core identifier in the image, distinguished by its green color, the large blue-green "20" numeral, and the architectural design resembling the White House. This specific combination is iconic and necessary for recognizing the denomination and currency. If these features are lost or altered, the note cannot be identified as a U.S. $20 bill, which undermines the educational purpose of the infographic. Therefore, this element is critical and weighs 3 points.
    Question: Is the U.S. $20 bill with its distinctive green color, "20" numeral, and architectural design visible in the edited image?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The Qatari Riyal note is uniquely identified by its pink-orange color, Arabic script, and the serial number "103 01". These features distinguish it from other Middle Eastern currencies. Since the infographic aims to represent real-world currencies, altering or removing these features would misrepresent the currency. Hence, this is a high-priority retention element with a weight of 3.
    Question: Is the Qatari Riyal note with its pink-orange hue, Arabic script, and serial number "103 01" present and recognizable?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The Indian Rupee 50 note is characterized by its yellow-brown color, the lion capital of Ashoka's pillar, and the "₹50" denomination in both Hindi and English. These are national symbols and key identifiers. Losing them would make the note unrecognizable as Indian currency, which is essential for the infographic’s accuracy. This is a core identity feature, thus weighted at 3.
    Question: Is the Indian Rupee 50 note with the lion capital symbol and yellow-brown color clearly visible?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The U.S. $1 bill is identifiable by the portrait of George Washington and the text "ONE DOLLAR". Although partially obscured, its presence is crucial for showing multiple U.S. denominations. Its inclusion helps establish the U.S. currency section in the infographic. While not as prominent, its absence would alter the currency set represented, so it is an important element with a weight of 2.
    Question: Is the U.S. $1 bill with the portrait of George Washington and "ONE DOLLAR" text present?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The arrangement of multiple banknotes in a single container (the wallet) implies a collection of international currencies. Even though the wallet is transformed into a blueprint, the **grouping of these four specific notes** must be preserved to maintain the original intent of showcasing diverse currencies. The co-presence of USD, QAR, and INR is a functional relationship that supports the educational theme. Thus, this grouping is important but not visually unique per se, hence weighted at 2.
    Question: Are all four banknotes (U.S. $20, Qatari Riyal, Indian Rupee 50, U.S. $1) present together in the same visual space?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The color palette of each note—green for USD, pink-orange for QAR, yellow-brown for INR—is a key visual cue for distinguishing currencies. While the infographic may simplify colors, the original hues are essential for accurate identification. Changing them arbitrarily could mislead viewers. This is a detail-level but significant element, so it is assigned 1 point.
    Question: Are the original dominant colors of the banknotes (green for USD, pink-orange for QAR, yellow-brown for INR) preserved?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
