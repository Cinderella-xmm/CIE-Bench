      "thinking_process": "The large, round brown eyes are the most prominent facial feature of the subject and serve as a core identifier. Their shape, size, and color are essential for recognizing the individual. In the chibi transformation, these eyes must remain clearly defined and retain their original characteristics to preserve identity. Losing them would make the character unrecognizable, making this a high-weight element.",
      "question": "Are the large, round brown eyes present and positioned symmetrically in the center of the face?",

      "thinking_process": "The tiara is a symbolic element that defines the subject’s regal theme and is explicitly mentioned in the instruction as being transformed into a \"miniature crown version.\" Its presence on the head is critical to maintaining the royal motif. Even if stylized, the tiara must remain identifiable as a crown-like object placed on top of the head. Removing or replacing it entirely would break the thematic continuity.",
      "question": "Is there a crown-like accessory present on the top of the head, resembling the original tiara in form and placement?",

      "thinking_process": "The facial structure—specifically the soft oval shape of the face, small nose, and gentle smile—is crucial for maintaining the subject’s identity. These features distinguish her from other characters and are not mentioned as changeable. In the chibi style, the proportions may be exaggerated, but the underlying facial structure must remain recognizable. Altering these would compromise identity recognition.",
      "question": "Does the face retain a soft oval shape with a small nose and a slight upward curve of the lips forming a gentle smile?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The skin tone and natural blush are distinctive visual traits that contribute to the subject’s appearance. While lighting may change in the new scene, the base skin color and subtle rosy cheeks should remain consistent to preserve realism and identity. A significant shift in skin tone would alter the subject’s likeness.",
      "question": "Is the skin tone light and fair with a natural pinkish blush visible on the cheeks?",

      "thinking_process": "The ears are a minor but identifiable anatomical feature. They are visible in the original image and should remain present in the chibi version to maintain anatomical coherence. While not a primary identifier, their absence or distortion could affect the believability of the character.",

      "thinking_process": "The hair color and wave pattern are part of the subject’s appearance, though the instruction allows for stylistic changes. However, the original brown wavy hair is a defining trait. In the chibi version, the hair should still be brown and exhibit a wavy texture, even if simplified. Changing the color or texture entirely would deviate from the original identity.",
      "question": "Is the hair brown in color and styled in soft waves framing the face?",
