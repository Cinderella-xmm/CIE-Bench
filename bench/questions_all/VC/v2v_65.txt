Description of reference image: The subject is a warrior character from *The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim*, depicted in a dynamic, crouched defensive stance on a rocky outcrop. The character wears a detailed Nordic-style helmet with prominent curved horns and a central white feather-like adornment. The helmet's metal surface features intricate engravings and a darkened patina. The character’s armor includes a fur-lined leather tunic with metallic shoulder pauldrons bearing swirling Norse-inspired patterns, and a large round shield held in the left hand, which has a dark, weathered surface with a central boss and visible rivets. A sword is sheathed at the character’s back, its hilt partially visible. The character’s posture suggests readiness for combat, with the right arm raised slightly and the body angled forward. The background consists of a vast, misty mountain range under a gray overcast sky, with snow-covered peaks and dense evergreen forests in the midground. The ground is wet and reflective, indicating recent rain or melting snow, with patches of ice and rock. The overall color palette is cold and muted, dominated by grays, blacks, whites, and deep greens. In the lower right corner, the text "The Elder Scrolls V SKYRIM" appears in a stylized font, accompanied by the game’s logo—a diamond-shaped emblem with a dragon motif. In the lower left corner, the Bethesda Game Studios logo is present.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions that explicitly transform the scene into a snow globe design. The instruction specifies reimagining the entire scene as a snow globe, including placing it atop a stone pedestal near a frosty window, with a snowy mountain view outside. Inside the globe, the character is to be rendered in a stylized 3D chibi form, standing proudly with their shield on a snowy crag, surrounded by tiny evergreen trees and miniature mountains. This indicates that the **form of the character** (from realistic to chibi), the **scale and perspective**, the **environmental context**, and the **overall composition** are all subject to transformation. However, the instruction does not mention altering the **core identity elements** of the character—such as the helmet design, shield shape, or weapon presence—only their style and scale. Therefore, changes allowed include:
- Transformation of the character into a chibi 3D model
- Change in pose to “standing proudly” instead of crouching
- Replacement of the real-world environment with a snow globe interior
- Addition of new elements like the stone pedestal, frosty window, and external snowy landscape
- Alteration of lighting to soft daylight with icy reflections and sparkles

Allowed Changes List:
- Character’s physical proportions (chibi style)
- Character’s pose (from crouched to standing proudly)
- Character’s rendering style (realistic to 3D stylized)
- Background environment (mountainous wilderness → snow globe interior)
- Scene framing (open landscape → enclosed globe)
- Lighting and atmosphere (dramatic overcast → soft daylight with sparkles)
- Presence of new elements: stone pedestal, frosty window, external snowy mountains
- Scale of objects (character and landscape reduced to miniature)

Step 2 - Determine the elements that should remain unchanged  
Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements: The character is a well-known figure from *Skyrim*, identifiable by specific visual markers. The **helmet with curved horns and central white feather** is an iconic symbol of the Nord warrior class and is essential for recognition. The **round shield with central boss and rivets** is a signature piece of equipment in the game and must be preserved in form, even if stylized. The **sword sheathed at the back** is a functional element tied to the character’s identity as a warrior; its presence is critical for maintaining logical consistency. These are core identity features that cannot be removed or fundamentally altered without losing the character’s recognizability.

Functional/logical association elements: The **shield is held in the left hand**, and the **sword is attached to the back**—these are functional placements that reflect the character’s combat-ready state. Even in chibi form, these relationships must be preserved to maintain logical coherence. If the shield were moved to the right hand or the sword disappeared, the character would no longer appear consistent with the original depiction.

Non-modified element deduction: After excluding allowed changes (style, pose, scale, environment), the remaining unmentioned details must be retained. These include:
- The **distinctive pattern on the shoulder pauldron** (swirling Norse design)
- The **fur trim on the tunic**
- The **metallic texture of the armor**
- The **presence of the sword hilt**
- The **shape and placement of the helmet’s horns**

These elements are not explicitly mentioned as changeable and are part of the original visual identity. They contribute to the authenticity of the character and must be preserved in some form, even if simplified in the chibi version.

Preservation Targets List:  
- The helmet with curved horns and central white feather  
- The round shield with central boss and rivets  
- The sword sheathed at the back  
- The swirling Norse pattern on the shoulder pauldron  
- The fur trim on the tunic  
- The metallic texture of the armor  
- The position of the sword hilt  
- The shape and placement of the helmet’s horns  

Q1:  
Thinking process: The helmet with curved horns and central white feather is the most iconic identifier of the character in *Skyrim*. It is a unique combination of shape and ornamentation that distinguishes this warrior from others. Losing the horns or the feather would make the character unrecognizable. This is a core identity feature, so it must be preserved even in chibi form. The question directly checks for the presence of the horn shape and feather, which are visually distinct and non-negotiable for identification.  
Question: Is the helmet equipped with two curved horns and a central white feather-like adornment?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The round shield with a central boss and visible rivets is a key accessory that defines the character’s combat role. Its shape and structural details are consistent across the game’s art and are essential for recognition. Even in a stylized chibi version, the shield must retain its circular form and central boss to maintain continuity. This is a high-weight element because it is both functional and iconic.  
Question: Does the character hold a round shield with a central boss and rivets?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The sword sheathed at the back is a functional and symbolic element. Its presence confirms the character’s status as a warrior. The hilt is visible and distinct, and its location is fixed. Removing or relocating it would break the logical consistency of the character’s gear setup. This is a critical functional element that must be preserved.  
Question: Is there a sword sheathed at the character’s back with a visible hilt?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The swirling Norse pattern on the shoulder pauldron is a distinctive decorative element that reflects the cultural design of the Nord race. It is not just ornamental but serves as a visual marker of origin. Even in a simplified chibi style, this pattern should be recognizable. Its preservation ensures cultural and stylistic fidelity.  
Question: Does the shoulder pauldron feature a swirling Norse-inspired engraved pattern?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The fur trim on the tunic is a key detail that adds texture and realism to the character’s appearance. It is a recurring feature in *Skyrim*’s Nord armor and helps distinguish it from other races. While the texture may be simplified in chibi form, the presence of fur along the edges of the tunic must be maintained to preserve visual coherence.  
Question: Does the tunic have fur trim along its edges?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The metallic texture of the armor is a defining visual quality that contributes to the character’s rugged, battle-worn look. Even in a stylized version, the armor should retain a metallic sheen or finish to suggest its material. This is a secondary but important detail that supports the overall identity.  
Question: Does the armor exhibit a metallic texture or finish?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The shape and placement of the helmet’s horns are critical for accurate representation. The horns curve outward and upward in a specific way, and their positioning relative to the helmet is fixed. Any deviation would alter the character’s silhouette and reduce recognizability. This is a minor but precise detail that supports the core identity.  
Question: Are the horns on the helmet curved outward and upward, positioned symmetrically on either side?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1
