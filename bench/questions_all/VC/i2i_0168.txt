Description of reference image:  
The image features several carrots growing in rich, dark soil. The carrots are orange with rounded, tapered shapes and are partially submerged in the soil, with their green leafy tops growing above ground. The leaves are bright green and have a serrated, lobed appearance. The background suggests a garden setting with blurred additional plants and soil.

### Step 1 - Allowed Changes List:

Thinking process:  
According to the instruction, the background scene needs to be replaced with an arctic environment featuring snow and icebergs. This means the current garden setting in the background can be altered. The instruction also clearly states that the carrots should remain rooted in soil, so we must keep the soil surrounding the carrots intact even though the rest of the background changes. There is no mention of altering the carrots themselves beyond keeping them in soil.

Allowed Changes List:  
Specific element 1 that allows for changes: The background can be replaced with an Arctic setting including snow and icebergs.  
Specific element 2 that allows for changes: The visual context of the surrounding garden environment can be modified.


### Step 2 - Elements That Should Remain Unchanged:

Thinking process:  
Based on the guidelines, the carrots’ core identity relies on their distinctive shape, color, and leaf structure. Functional/logical association elements include the soil as the medium in which they are growing. Retaining the soil ensures the logic of the carrots still growing in a natural way. Remaining elements, such as the carrots' textures and the positioning of the leaves, contribute to visual coherence.

Preservation Targets List:  
(Element 1 that should be maintained: Carrots’ orange color and rounded-tapered shape)  
(Element 2 that should be maintained: Green leaves with serrated edges and lobed structure)  
(Element 3 that should be maintained: Soil texture surrounding the carrots' roots)  
(Element 4 that should be maintained: Positioning of the carrots as partially underground)


### Step 3 - Key Identifying Visual Elements and Questions:

{
    Q1:  
    Thinking process: The core recognition feature of the carrots is their vibrant orange color and distinct shape. Losing this would make it hard to recognize them as carrots, thus a key element with 3 points.
    Question: Are the carrots depicted in a bright orange color with their rounded-tapered shape preserved?  
    Choices: Yes, No  
    A: Yes  
    Weight: 3  
}

{
    Q2:  
    Thinking process: The green leaves with serrated edges and lobed structure are iconic identifiers of the carrot plant. These features maintain the identity of the plant, thus an important element with 2 points.
    Question: Are the carrots topped with bright green serrated leaves with a lobed appearance?  
    Choices: Yes, No  
    A: Yes  
    Weight: 2  
}

{
    Q3:  
    Thinking process: Keeping the soil surrounding the carrots is necessary to logically illustrate the carrots growing in a natural manner. This is important for scene consistency and has a weight of 2 points.
    Question: Is the soil texture surrounding the carrots’ roots preserved showing they are rooted in soil rather than snow or ice?  
    Choices: Yes, No  
    A: Yes  
    Weight: 2  
}

{
    Q4:  
    Thinking process: The positioning of the carrots affects the realism and coherence of the image. Having them partially underground maintains the expected growth pattern of carrots. This is a secondary detail with 1 point.
    Question: Are the carrots positioned in a way that shows they are partially underground, consistent with their natural growth pattern?  
    Choices: Yes, No  
    A: Yes  
    Weight: 1  
}

{
    Q5:  
    Thinking process: The visible texture of the carrots contributes to the authenticity of the image. Maintaining this detail enhances the visual consistency, thus a minor detail with 1 point.
    Question: Do the carrots have visible surface textures like natural ridges or marks?  
    Choices: Yes, No  
    A: Yes  
    Weight: 1
