      "thinking_process": "The wide, straight avenue leading directly to the Eiffel Tower is a core compositional element that defines the spatial relationship between the viewer and the monument. It is essential for maintaining the sense of scale and direction. Its removal or distortion would break the visual logic of the scene. Since the instruction does not mention modifying the road, it must remain unchanged. This is a key structural element of the scene, critical for spatial consistency.",
      "question": "Is the wide, straight avenue leading directly toward the base of the Eiffel Tower preserved in the edited image?",

      "thinking_process": "The symmetrical rows of green trees flanking the avenue are visually distinctive and contribute to the formal balance of the scene. They are not referenced in the editing instruction, meaning they are not intended to be altered. Their absence or misplacement would disrupt the symmetry and realism of the setting. These trees are important environmental markers that anchor the scene in real-world Paris.",
      "question": "Are the symmetrical rows of green trees lining both sides of the avenue preserved in the edited image?",

      "thinking_process": "The streetlights along the avenue are functional and aesthetic elements that contribute to the nighttime ambiance and guide the viewer’s eye. They are positioned regularly and are visible in the original image. Since the instruction does not mention altering them, they must remain. Their presence ensures continuity in the urban environment.",
      "question": "Are the streetlights positioned along the sides of the avenue preserved in the edited image?",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The wet pavement with visible reflections indicates recent rain and adds atmospheric depth. This detail enhances realism and mood. It is not mentioned in the editing instruction, so it must remain. Losing this would reduce the environmental authenticity and alter the lighting dynamics of the scene.",
      "question": "Is the wet asphalt surface with visible reflections preserved in the edited image?",

      "thinking_process": "The overcast sky with dark, layered clouds is a dominant feature of the image’s mood and lighting. It contributes to the dramatic atmosphere and affects how light interacts with the scene. Since the instruction does not involve altering the sky, it must remain unchanged. This is a key environmental element that sets the tone.",

      "thinking_process": "The distant Parisian skyline, including low-rise buildings and modern skyscrapers, provides geographical context and confirms the location as Paris. It is not mentioned in the editing instruction, so it must remain. Altering or removing it would make the setting ambiguous or incorrect.",
      "question": "Is the distant Parisian skyline with identifiable rooftops and modern high-rises preserved in the edited image?",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The presence of vehicles on the road, including cars and a bus, adds life and scale to the scene. They are not referenced in the editing instruction, so they must remain. Their absence would make the scene feel empty or unreal.",
      "question": "Are the vehicles, including cars and a bus, visible on the road in the edited image?",
