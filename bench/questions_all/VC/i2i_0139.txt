Description of reference image:  
The subject is a bright orange carrot with a conical shape, rooted in dark soil. The carrot has a green leafy top attached to the tapered top end. The soil surrounding the carrot appears loose and rich with organic matter, suggesting an outdoor garden setting. In the blurred background, there are hints of other carrots growing in similar conditions.

Thinking process:  
The instructions call for changing the carrot’s growing environment to a space greenhouse with a metallic climate-controlled cultivation chamber while keeping the plant rooted in a synthetic substrate. This means:  
1. **Subject Form:** The carrot can retain its current form, shape, and color.  
2. **Scene/Environment:** The natural outdoor setting can be entirely replaced with a high-tech space greenhouse environment.  
3. **Rooting Medium:** The natural soil can be swapped for a synthetic substrate.  

### Allowed Changes List:
- The outdoor garden setting can be removed and replaced with a space greenhouse interior.
- The natural soil can be changed to a synthetic substrate.
- Background elements, including other carrots, can be adjusted to fit the new space greenhouse environment.

Thinking process:  
The core recognition elements include the carrot's conical shape, bright orange color, and attached green leafy top—these features define it as a carrot. Functional/logical elements encompass the connection between the leaves and the root and the position of the carrot relative to the growing medium. Remaining visual coherence includes the natural appearance of the carrot.

Preservation Targets List:
- Carrot's bright orange color and conical shape.
- Green leafy top and its natural attachment to the carrot.
- Tapered top end with visible roots.
- The carrot’s upright position in the substrate.

    Q1:  
    Thinking process: The carrot's bright orange color is a core identity feature. Losing this would make the carrot unrecognizable.
    Question: Is the carrot still bright orange in color?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

{
    Q2:  
    Thinking process: The conical shape of the carrot is critical for maintaining its identity, as it distinguishes it from other root vegetables.
    Question: Does the carrot maintain its conical shape?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

{
    Q3:  
    Thinking process: The green leafy top is an important accessory for recognizing the carrot, as it links to its natural growth habits. Its presence is necessary for maintaining the plant's identity.
    Question: Are the green leaves still present at the top of the carrot?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

{
    Q4:  
    Thinking process: The tapered top end with visible roots is a key detail that ensures the carrot retains its realistic appearance. Its absence would compromise the visual consistency.
    Question: Is the tapered top end of the carrot with visible roots still present?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q5:  
    Thinking process: The carrot’s upright positioning is essential for maintaining functional and logical associations. It must appear planted in the substrate similarly to how it was in the natural environment.
    Question: Is the carrot still positioned upright in the substrate?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
