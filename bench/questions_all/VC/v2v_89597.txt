### Step 1 - Description of Reference Image and Allowed Changes List:

**Description of Reference Image:**  
The image showcases the interior of a modern vehicle, focusing on the large central touchscreen and the surrounding dashboard. The touchscreen displays various controls and settings, including climate control, fan speed, and other vehicle functions. The screen also shows airflow graphics indicating the direction of air circulation. The dashboard features sleek design elements, with dark wood paneling adding a touch of elegance. The steering wheel is partially visible on the left, and the overall ambiance reflects a high-tech and luxurious feel.

**Thinking Process:**  
The editing instructions specify transforming the vehicle's interior into a traditional Chinese ink wash painting. This involves converting the glowing central touchscreen and the wood paneling into expressive calligraphic strokes and ink washes. However, the essence of the vehicle's interior, such as the layout and positioning of the elements, should remain intact.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
1. The central touchscreen's interface and airflow graphics can be transformed into calligraphic strokes and ink washes.
2. The wood grain texture can be replaced with bold, freehand brushwork.
3. The overall color scheme and lighting can be adjusted to match the aesthetic of an ink wash painting.

### Step 2 - Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged:

**Thinking Process:**  
Core recognition elements include the layout and positioning of the central touchscreen and dashboard, as these define the vehicle's interior. Functional/logical association elements involve maintaining the relationship between the touchscreen and the dashboard to ensure the scene remains coherent. Remaining elements, such as the partial visibility of the steering wheel, contribute to the overall visual consistency.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
1. The layout and positioning of the central touchscreen.
2. The general structure and placement of the dashboard.
3. The partial visibility of the steering wheel.
4. The overall spatial arrangement of the vehicle's interior.

### Step 3 - Generate Yes/No Questions:

**Q1:**  
Thinking process: The central touchscreen's layout is a core recognition feature. If its position or layout is altered, the vehicle's interior may lose its identity.  
Question: Is the central touchscreen still positioned in the center of the dashboard?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3

**Q2:**  
Thinking process: The dashboard's structure is crucial for maintaining the scene's coherence. Any significant changes could disrupt the logical relationship between the elements.  
Question: Does the dashboard retain its general structure and placement relative to the steering wheel?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2

**Q3:**  
Thinking process: The steering wheel's partial visibility helps anchor the viewer's perspective within the vehicle's interior. Losing this detail would slightly affect the visual consistency.  
Question: Is the steering wheel still partially visible on the left side of the image?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1

**Q4:**  
Thinking process: The spatial arrangement of the vehicle's interior is essential for maintaining the scene's realism. Altering this could lead to confusion.  
Question: Does the overall spatial arrangement of the vehicle's interior remain consistent with the original image?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2

**Q5:**  
Thinking process: The airflow graphics on the screen, though transformed, should still convey the concept of airflow direction. This maintains the functional aspect of the screen's display.  
Question: Are the airflow graphics on the screen still discernible, even if represented through calligraphic strokes?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2

These questions focus on retaining the core visual elements and ensuring the edited image remains faithful to the original while incorporating the specified artistic transformation.
