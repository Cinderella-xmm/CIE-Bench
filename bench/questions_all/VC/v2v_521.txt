Description of reference image: The subject is a mid-century kitchen interior with a warm, nostalgic ambiance. On the left side, there is a cream-colored vintage refrigerator with two horizontal chrome handles and a round dial on the upper door. Above it, two framed retro advertisements are mounted on the wall: one features a green glass bottle labeled "7UP" next to a glass of orange liquid with the text "Fresh Up with 7UP," and the other shows a smiling woman holding a bowl of cereal with the text "BRAN FLAKES BEST FOR BREAKFAST." The walls are painted in a muted beige tone, and the backsplash consists of square brown tiles arranged in a grid pattern. Below the posters, a countertop holds several objects: a dark metallic urn with two handles and a lid, a white ceramic jar with a rounded lid, a terracotta vase with embossed patterns, and a small gray pot containing wooden utensils. In the center of the scene is a cream-colored gas stove with black burners and five black control knobs; a matching cream kettle with a black handle sits atop it. To the right of the stove is a cream toaster with perforated sides and a single knob. A large cream-colored range hood extends above the stove. On the far right, a wooden cutting board leans against the wall, and a wooden bowl filled with wooden spoons rests on the counter. In the foreground, a small cream-colored analog clock with black numerals and hands displays the time as approximately 10:10. The cabinets beneath the counters are light wood with recessed panel doors and round black knobs. The countertops are made of speckled beige stone. The floor is tiled in a reddish-brown hue, and soft shadows suggest ambient lighting from the front-left.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions that clearly state what can be changed. The instruction specifies creating a retro-style trading card with a stylized illustration of iconic kitchen items such as a cream-hued stove, retro fridge, and wooden utensils—indicating that these elements may be reinterpreted or simplified in form but not necessarily removed. The instruction allows for changes in texture (e.g., worn paper), color palette (muted earthy tones), layout (rounded edges, borders), and background (patterned tiles). It also introduces new elements like text labels ("{{brand}}", "{{product_name}}", etc.) and soft floor shadows beneath the card. However, the instruction does not mention altering the core identity of the original kitchen objects or their functional relationships. Therefore, any transformation must preserve the essential visual characteristics of the original objects unless explicitly permitted by the instruction. The instruction does not require retaining the exact composition or spatial arrangement of the original scene, nor does it mandate preserving specific details like the brand names on the posters or the exact time on the clock. Thus, the allowed changes include:
- The overall scene structure (replaced by a trading card format)
- Background textures and colors
- Lighting and shadow effects
- Addition of text and decorative borders
- Simplification or stylization of object forms

Allowed Changes List:
- The physical environment (kitchen setting) can be replaced with a trading card layout
- The background tile pattern can be altered or abstracted into a decorative motif
- The lighting and shadows can be modified to suit the retro card aesthetic
- The presence and placement of text elements (brand, product name, company name, serial number) are new additions and not part of the original image
- The texture of surfaces (e.g., paper-like wear, rounded edges) can be added
- The scale, proportion, and positioning of objects can be adjusted within the card frame
- The color scheme can be shifted toward muted earthy tones (beige, soft green, brown)

Step 2 - Determine the elements that should remain unchanged  
Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements: The original image contains several iconic mid-century kitchen appliances and decor that serve as key identifiers of the era and style. These include the cream-colored refrigerator with its distinctive chrome handles and round dial, the gas stove with black burners and multiple knobs, the kettle with a black handle, the toaster with perforated sides, and the wooden utensils in a bowl. These objects have unique shapes and design features that define their identity. For example, the refrigerator’s two-door configuration with horizontal handles and the round dial is a hallmark of 1950s design. Similarly, the stove’s black grates and five knobs are characteristic of vintage models. If these are significantly altered in shape or function, they lose their recognizability. The posters on the wall—especially the "7UP" and "Bran Flakes" ads—are culturally significant and visually distinct; their content and layout contribute to the nostalgic atmosphere. While the instruction allows for stylization, the core visual identity of these items must be preserved if they are to be included in the edited version.

Functional/logical association elements: The relationship between the objects and their placement reflects typical kitchen functionality. For instance, the kettle is placed on the stove, the toaster is adjacent to the stove, and the utensils are stored in a bowl near the cooking area. These spatial relationships support logical use and should be maintained if the scene is to retain coherence. Additionally, the clock showing 10:10 is a common display time in advertising due to its symmetry and readability; while this detail may seem minor, it contributes to the authenticity of the scene.

Non-modified element deduction: After excluding the allowed changes (such as background, lighting, and text overlays), the remaining elements that must be retained are those that are not mentioned as changeable and are integral to the original image’s identity. These include the specific forms of the appliances, the types of utensils, the poster designs, and the clock face. Even though the instruction permits a stylized interpretation, the fundamental visual traits of these elements must remain intact to ensure consistency with the original.

Q1:  
Thinking process: The cream-colored refrigerator with two horizontal chrome handles and a round dial on the upper door is a core recognition feature of the original image. This specific design is iconic of mid-century refrigerators and serves as a primary identifier of the era. If the shape, handle configuration, or dial is altered, the object would no longer be recognizable as the same model. The presence and position of the dial are particularly important because they distinguish this refrigerator from others. Therefore, this element is critical for maintaining the identity of the scene and must be preserved.
