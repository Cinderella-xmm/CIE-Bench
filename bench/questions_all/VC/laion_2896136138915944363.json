      "thinking_process": "The scalloped wing pattern is a defining characteristic of this sandpiper species, particularly in field guides. It consists of repeating dark-edged, light-centered feather shapes arranged in overlapping rows. Losing this pattern would make the bird unrecognizable as this species. Thus, it is a core identification feature with high weight.",
      "question": "Does the stylized illustration retain the scalloped pattern on the wings and back, with alternating dark and light feather edges forming a scale-like texture?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The peach-orange breast is a key diagnostic trait of the bird during breeding plumage. It contrasts sharply with the darker upperparts and is central to species identification. Any significant alteration in color or absence would misrepresent the bird.",
      "question": "Is the breast and throat area rendered in a consistent peach-orange hue, distinct from the darker upper body?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The long, straight black beak is a primary identifier of shorebirds and distinguishes this species from others with shorter or curved bills. Its shape and color are critical for accurate representation.",
      "question": "Is the beak long, straight, and uniformly black, extending from the face without curvature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The dark eye with surrounding pale skin is a focal point in the illustration and helps define facial structure. While minor stylization is acceptable, the presence and position of the eye are essential for maintaining the bird’s likeness.",
      "question": "Is there a clearly defined dark eye positioned near the center of the head, surrounded by lighter skin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The three-toed feet with dark legs are typical of sandpipers and help confirm the bird’s posture and species. Altering the number of toes or leg color would misrepresent the anatomy.",
      "question": "Are the legs dark gray-black and do they end in three forward-facing toes with visible claws?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The bird’s stance—standing upright on sand near water—is part of the original composition and implied by the instruction to preserve the shoreline context. Even if stylized, the pose must reflect a natural resting position on a beach.",
      "question": "Is the bird depicted in a standing posture, with legs fully extended and body upright, as if on a shoreline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The presence of beach grass and pebbles in the foreground grounds the bird in its natural habitat. While simplified, their inclusion supports ecological authenticity and visual coherence.",
      "question": "Are there small tufts of beach grass and scattered pebbles visible in the foreground beneath the bird’s feet?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q8",
      "thinking_process": "The contrast between the warm underparts and mottled upper body is a key visual cue for species recognition. This tonal division defines the bird’s silhouette and pattern.",
      "question": "Is there a clear transition from the warm peach-orange underparts to the darker, mottled upper body and wings?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
