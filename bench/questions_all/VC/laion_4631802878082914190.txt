**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

Description of reference image:  
The subject is a circular diagram representing the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology. It consists of six labeled blue rectangular nodes arranged in a clockwise cycle around a central gray database icon labeled "Data." The nodes are: "Business Understanding," "Data Understanding," "Data Preparation," "Modeling," "Evaluation," and "Deployment." Each node is connected by thick gray arrows forming a continuous loop, indicating the cyclical nature of the process. The arrows flow clockwise, with bidirectional arrows between "Data Understanding" and "Business Understanding," and between "Data Preparation" and "Modeling," suggesting iterative feedback. The central database icon is stylized as a stack of three cylindrical disks, resembling a traditional database server, with subtle shading to give it a 3D appearance. The background is plain white, and all text is in white sans-serif font on blue rounded rectangles. The overall layout is clean, symmetrical, and structured.

Thinking process:  
The editing instructions explicitly transform the entire visual form of the diagram into a whimsical comic illustration titled “The Adventures of Data Journey!” This includes replacing all original elements—characters, scene, style, and layout—with new ones based on animal personas and a storybook aesthetic. The instruction specifies that:

- The **original diagram structure** (circular flow, six stages) is being reimagined but not preserved in form.
- The **arrows** are to be replaced with playful paths (e.g., stepping stones or bridges).
- The **central data element** (database icon) is to be replaced with glowing data crystals.
- The **nodes** are to be replaced with animal characters in specific roles.
- The **style** shifts from professional/technical to bright, cartoonish, storybook-like.
- The **title** is to be added in a banner at the top.

All these changes indicate that the **entire visual composition**, including the **shape, color scheme, layout, and symbolic representation**, is to be transformed. However, the **functional logic** of the CRISP-DM process must still be preserved in the narrative structure—i.e., the sequence and relationships between steps.

Allowed Changes List:  
(Specific element 1 that allows for changes): The shape and design of the central data symbol (database icon).  
(Specific element 2 that allows for changes): The directional arrows connecting the nodes.  
(Specific element 3 that allows for changes): The color scheme and typography of the labels.  
(Specific element 4 that allows for changes): The layout and spatial arrangement of the nodes (though their sequence must remain logical).  
(Specific element 5 that allows for changes): The overall artistic style (from technical diagram to comic-style illustration).  
(Specific element 6 that allows for changes): The presence and form of the title text and its placement.  
(Specific element 7 that allows for changes): The use of speech bubbles and character designs.  
(Specific element 8 that allows for changes): The background environment (from plain white to illustrated landscape).

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

Thinking process:  
Despite the extensive transformation, certain **core functional and structural elements** must remain logically consistent to preserve the identity and purpose of the diagram. These include:

- **Core recognition elements**: While the visual form changes, the **six distinct stages** of CRISP-DM must still be present and identifiable by name or function. The names themselves ("Business Understanding", etc.) may be altered in presentation but must retain their meaning. The **cyclical nature** of the process must also be preserved, even if represented through a winding road instead of arrows.
  
- **Functional/logical association elements**: The **order and interdependence** of the stages must remain intact. For example, "Data Understanding" must follow "Business Understanding," and "Modeling" must come after "Data Preparation." Bidirectional feedback between certain stages (e.g., "Data Understanding ↔ Business Understanding") must be maintained in some form (e.g., two-way paths or dialogue).

- **Non-modified element deduction**: The **number of stages** (six), their **relative sequence**, and the **presence of a central data source** must be retained. Although the database icon is replaced with crystals, the concept of a central data repository remains essential. Additionally, the **flow direction** (clockwise) should be preserved to maintain intuitive understanding.

Preservation Targets List:  
(Element 1 that should be maintained): The presence of six distinct process stages in the diagram.  
(Element 2 that should be maintained): The sequential order of the stages following the CRISP-DM workflow: Business Understanding → Data Understanding → Data Preparation → Modeling → Evaluation → Deployment → back to Business Understanding.  
(Element 3 that should be maintained): The bidirectional relationship between "Data Understanding" and "Business Understanding."  
(Element 4 that should be maintained): The bidirectional relationship between "Data Preparation" and "Modeling."  
(Element 5 that should be maintained): The presence of a central data source located in the middle of the cycle.  
(Element 6 that should be maintained): The cyclical nature of the process (returning to the start after Deployment).

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The six-stage structure is the core identity of the CRISP-DM model. Removing or merging any stage would fundamentally alter the process’s definition. Even in a whimsical version, the number of stages must remain six to maintain fidelity to the original methodology. This is a key identifier of the framework, so losing it would render the diagram unrecognizable as CRISP-DM.
    Question: Does the edited image contain exactly six labeled process stages corresponding to the CRISP-DM phases?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The correct sequence of stages ensures the logical flow of the data mining process. Reordering them (e.g., placing Modeling before Data Preparation) would break the functional integrity of the model. Since the instruction specifies a "winding road" representing data flow, the path must reflect the correct progression.
    Question: Are the six stages arranged in the correct sequential order: Business Understanding → Data Understanding → Data Preparation → Modeling → Evaluation → Deployment → back to Business Understanding?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The bidirectional connection between "Data Understanding" and "Business Understanding" is a defining feature of CRISP-DM, allowing for iterative refinement. In the original image, this is shown via double-headed arrows. Even in the comic version, this relationship must be preserved through equivalent visual cues (e.g., two-way paths or dialogue).
    Question: Is there a bidirectional connection (e.g., two-way path or mutual interaction) between the "Business Understanding" and "Data Understanding" stages?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: Similarly, the bidirectional link between "Data Preparation" and "Modeling" reflects the iterative nature of building models. This is critical for accurate representation. The edited image must show this feedback loop, even if stylized.
    Question: Is there a bidirectional connection (e.g., two-way path or mutual interaction) between the "Data Preparation" and "Modeling" stages?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The central data source is a core conceptual element of the diagram. While its visual form changes from a database icon to glowing crystals, its position and role as the shared resource for all stages must remain. Its central location in the diagram reinforces its importance.
    Question: Is there a central data source located at the center of the diagram, accessible to all six stages?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The cyclical nature of the process is fundamental to CRISP-DM, emphasizing ongoing improvement. The return path from Deployment back to Business Understanding must be visible, even if represented as a winding road or bridge. Losing this loop would make the diagram linear and incorrect.
    Question: Does the diagram include a clear return path from the "Deployment" stage back to the "Business Understanding" stage, completing the cycle?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
