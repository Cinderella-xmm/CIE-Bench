      "thinking_process": "The stylized \"P\" logo with a cart-like shape and circular wheel is the primary brand identifier of Pablo Cheese Tart. Its unique design, including the curved handle and wheel, is central to public recognition of the product. If this logo is altered or replaced, the tart would no longer be identifiable as a Pablo product, making it a core identity element. Therefore, it must be retained in its original form.",
      "question": "Is the stylized \"P\" logo with a cart-like shape and circular wheel present on the surface of both tarts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The word \"PABLO\" directly beneath the logo is a textual component of the brand identity. It reinforces the brand name and is inseparable from the logo in terms of recognition. Removing or distorting this text would compromise brand clarity. Since the instruction does not specify changing the text, it must be preserved as a key identifier.",
      "question": "Is the word \"PABLO\" written in uppercase letters beneath the logo on both tarts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The bright yellow top layer is a defining visual trait of the Pablo cheese tart, distinguishing it from other cheesecakes. This color is a result of the caramelization process and is crucial to the product's visual appeal. Any significant deviation in hue or coverage would alter the product’s identity.",
      "question": "Does the top surface of each tart display a bright yellow layer covering most of the surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The white creamy filling beneath the yellow layer is a structural and textural hallmark of the tart. It represents the soft, custard-like interior that contrasts with the crisp crust. Preserving this layer ensures the accurate depiction of the product’s internal composition, which is essential for consumer recognition.",
      "question": "Is there a visible white creamy filling beneath the yellow top layer in both tarts, especially in the sliced portion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The golden-brown, flaky crust with irregular edges is a key physical attribute that defines the tart’s baked appearance. It contributes to the perception of freshness and artisanal quality. While minor artistic exaggeration may be allowed, the basic texture and color of the crust must remain intact to preserve the product’s realism.",
      "question": "Does the crust of both tarts exhibit a golden-brown color with a flaky, uneven edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The partial slice of the rear tart reveals the internal cross-section, showing the layered structure of crust, filling, and top layer. This detail is functionally important as it demonstrates the product’s texture and depth. Altering or removing this section would misrepresent the tart’s true form.",
      "question": "Is the rear tart partially sliced to reveal the internal cross-section of the filling and crust?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The relative positioning of the two tarts—one whole in front, one sliced behind—creates a compositional balance that highlights both the exterior and interior of the product. This layout is a deliberate presentation choice and helps convey the full character of the tart. Disrupting this arrangement would affect the informative value of the image.",
      "question": "Is the whole tart positioned in front of the partially sliced tart, with the latter slightly elevated and angled toward the back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
