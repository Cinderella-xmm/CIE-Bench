### Step 1 - Description of Reference Image and Allowed Changes List:

**Description of Reference Image:**  
The image features three human figures positioned in the foreground, with a microscope prominently placed in the center. The figure on the left wears a white tank top, the central figure has long dark hair and a neutral expression, and the figure on the right is an older man with a white beard wearing a brown robe. In the background, there is a flying parrot with red tail feathers and a lemur perched on a tree branch. The background also includes a cloudy sky and some trees.

**Thinking Process:**  
The editing instructions specify converting the bird, lemur, and human characters into 3D chibi-style models while retaining their outfits, accessories, and the arrangement of the scene. This means the form of the subjects can change, but their positions, attire, and the overall composition must remain consistent.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
1. The bird, lemur, and human figures can be transformed into 3D chibi-style models.
2. The proportions and angles of the characters can be adjusted to fit the chibi style.
3. The texture and color of the characters may change to match the 3D chibi aesthetic.

### Step 2 - Determination of Elements That Should Remain Unchanged:

**Thinking Process:**  
Core recognition elements include the distinct features of the characters (e.g., the older man’s beard, the central figure’s long hair), the presence of the microscope and pocket watch, and the background elements like the parrot and lemur. Functional/logical association elements include the positioning of the characters relative to the microscope and the background elements. Remaining elements like the color scheme and specific details of the background should be retained for visual coherence.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
1. The presence and position of the microscope.
2. The older man’s white beard and robe.
3. The central figure’s long dark hair.
4. The parrot and lemur in the background.
5. The overall arrangement of the characters and objects.

### Step 3 - Generation of Yes/No Questions:

**Q1:**  
Thinking process: The microscope is a key element in the scene, and its presence and position are crucial for maintaining the scene's integrity. Losing this would significantly alter the image's identity.
Question: Is the microscope still present in the same position in the foreground?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

**Q2:**  
Thinking process: The older man’s white beard is a distinctive feature that helps identify him. Changing or removing it would make him unrecognizable.
Question: Does the older man still have his white beard?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

**Q3:**  
Thinking process: The central figure’s long dark hair is a defining characteristic. Altering it would affect the identity of the character.
Question: Does the central figure still have long dark hair?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

**Q4:**  
Thinking process: The parrot and lemur are background elements that contribute to the scene's context. Their presence is important for maintaining the overall composition.
Question: Are the parrot and lemur still present in the background?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

**Q5:**  
Thinking process: The arrangement of the characters and objects is essential for preserving the scene's logic and coherence. Any significant change would disrupt the visual flow.
Question: Are the characters and objects arranged in the same way as in the original image?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
