      "thinking_process": "The green desk lamp is a critical visual identifier in the original image, providing both functional lighting and distinct color contrast. Its presence and green shade are unique to the scene and help establish mood and authenticity. Even if stylized, its color and position must be preserved to maintain visual consistency. If removed or replaced, the scene loses a key atmospheric element. This is a core identity feature tied to the environment and lighting setup, hence weighted at 3 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The grid-patterned window is a defining architectural feature in the background, contributing to the depth and natural lighting of the scene. It is not mentioned for modification in the instructions and serves as a structural anchor. Its removal or alteration would disrupt the spatial logic and lighting cues. As a key environmental element, its retention ensures scene coherence, warranting a weight of 2 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The open book with visibly aged, yellowed pages is central to the narrative of reading and scholarship. Although the instruction allows elongation, the fundamental attribute of being an open book with readable text and aged paper must remain. Losing this would break the core action of the scene. Thus, it is a key functional object, deserving a weight of 3 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The figure’s seated posture at the desk, leaning forward with her hand on the book, defines the action and engagement in the scene. This pose is crucial for conveying focus and intent. While style may shift to cartoonish, the physical positioning must remain to preserve narrative logic. It is a core functional posture, so it is assigned 2 points.",

Though the instruction mentions artistic transformation, the material and surface detail are not specified for change.
