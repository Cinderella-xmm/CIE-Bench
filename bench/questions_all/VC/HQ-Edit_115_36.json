      "thinking_process": "The orange and white fur coloration is the core identity feature of the cat. The specific distribution — ginger body with white chest, chin, and muzzle — is unique to this individual and distinguishes it from other cats. Changing this would result in a different animal or misrepresentation of the original subject. This is a 3-point element because it is essential for recognition.",
      "question": "Is the cat’s fur predominantly orange with white markings on the chest, chin, and muzzle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The cat’s upward gaze and alert posture are central to its identity as an observer. This pose conveys curiosity and attentiveness, aligning with the “Watcher” theme. Altering the direction of the gaze or collapsing the posture would destroy the intended character trait. This is a 3-point element due to its functional role in defining the character’s behavior.",
      "question": "Is the cat sitting upright with its head tilted upward, gazing toward the sky through the window?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The six-pane window with white framing is a distinctive architectural feature that anchors the scene. It provides context and defines the environment. A different window configuration (e.g., single pane or arched) would disrupt the visual consistency and alter the setting. This is a 2-point element because it is crucial to the scene but not the subject itself.",
      "question": "Does the window consist of six rectangular panes arranged in a 2x3 grid with white frames?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The clear blue sky visible through the window is explicitly required in the instructions to reflect Solara’s tranquil nature. It is a key environmental cue. If replaced with clouds, fog, or night sky, the mood and thematic consistency would be broken. This is a 2-point element because it supports the narrative and emotional tone.",
      "question": "Is the sky visible through the window a solid, clear blue without significant cloud cover?",

      "thinking_process": "The presence of the cream-colored sheer curtain on the right side of the window is a detail that adds realism and depth to the scene. While minor, its absence would make the composition feel incomplete or unbalanced. It contributes to the ambient lighting and spatial awareness. This is a 1-point element because it is a secondary detail but enhances visual coherence.",
      "question": "Is there a cream-colored sheer curtain partially drawn back on the right side of the window?",

      "thinking_process": "The cat’s thick, bushy tail curled around its body is a defining physical trait, especially in long-haired breeds. It contributes to the sense of volume and comfort. Removing or simplifying it would affect the species identification and overall balance. This is a 2-point element because it is a major anatomical feature tied to the subject’s appearance.",
      "question": "Is the cat’s tail thick, fluffy, and curled around its body in a relaxed manner?",

      "thinking_process": "The wooden floor beneath the cat provides grounding and reflects the indoor setting. Its dark brown color and visible grain add realism. Changing it to carpet or tile would shift the environment significantly. This is a 1-point element as it supports the scene but is less critical than the subject or window.",
      "question": "Is the cat sitting on a dark brown wooden floor with visible planks and natural wood grain?",

      "thinking_process": "The cat’s large, golden-brown eyes with visible reflections are key to expressing its alertness and emotional state. These eyes are central to the character’s expressive quality. Altering their size, color, or reflection would reduce recognizability and emotional impact. This is a 3-point element because it is a primary facial identifier.",
      "question": "Do the cat’s eyes appear large, round, and golden-brown with clear reflections indicating light source from the right?",
