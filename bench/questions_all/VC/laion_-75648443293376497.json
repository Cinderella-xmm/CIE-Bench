      "thinking_process": "The roll-top closure with two vertical leather straps is the defining structural feature of this backpack model. Its presence and dual-straps configuration are core to identifying the bag. Removing or reconfiguring them would fundamentally alter the object’s identity. Therefore, preserving this exact arrangement is essential and qualifies as a 3-point core element.",
      "question": "Is the roll-top closure secured by two vertical brown leather straps positioned symmetrically on the front?",

      "thinking_process": "The front flap with a central snap button closure is a distinctive design element that differentiates this backpack from others. The snap is a key functional and aesthetic detail located precisely at the center of the flap. Its absence or relocation would disrupt the visual balance and functionality, making it a high-priority retention point.",
      "question": "Is there a central snap button closure on the front flap of the backpack?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The side pockets with brown leather trim are consistent in shape and placement across both sides. They contribute to the backpack’s balanced design and utility. While their material may be altered, their existence and position must be preserved for structural integrity and visual consistency.",
      "question": "Are there two side pockets, each trimmed with brown leather, located on the left and right sides of the backpack?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The brand patch labeled \"SAUZER\" is a specific identifier placed on the lower right front panel. It serves as a signature branding element. Although the patch might be aged or stylized in the edit, its location and presence are crucial for maintaining authenticity and traceability to the original design.",
      "question": "Is there a small rectangular leather brand patch located on the lower right front panel of the backpack?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The two metal D-rings at the base corners are functional hardware elements that anchor the backpack’s bottom. Their placement is fixed and essential for accessory attachment. Even if the metal finish changes, their presence and corner positioning must remain unaltered to maintain structural logic.",
      "question": "Are there two metal D-rings attached to the bottom corners of the backpack via brown leather loops?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The symmetrical arrangement of the shoulder straps and the central alignment of the front flap are critical to the backpack’s balanced design. Any asymmetry or misalignment would break the visual harmony and suggest a distorted version. Preserving this symmetry ensures the object remains identifiable as the same model.",
      "question": "Are the shoulder straps symmetrically aligned and centered relative to the backpack body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The stitching lines define the compartments and seams of the backpack. While the texture may change, the visible stitching pattern helps maintain the original construction details. Its presence supports visual coherence and craftsmanship representation.",
      "question": "Are there visible stitching lines defining the compartments and edges of the backpack?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
