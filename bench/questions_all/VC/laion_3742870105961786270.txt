Description of reference image: The subject is a figurine of a woman in traditional, rustic attire, standing in profile facing left. She has long, wavy brown hair styled in braids and wears a layered outfit consisting of a brown tunic, a reddish-brown cloak draped over her shoulders with a gold clasp at the neck, and a dark skirt. Her right arm is raised, balancing a large black ceramic jug on her shoulder; the jug has a wide base and narrow neck with textured surface details resembling aged pottery. In her left arm, she carries a woven basket filled with colorful fruits including grapes, apples, and pears. A smaller, terracotta-colored jug with a heart-shaped engraving rests beneath her left arm, partially tucked into her clothing. At her feet, a white goose with an orange beak and webbed feet stands facing forward, its body slightly angled toward the viewer. The entire figure appears to be made of painted resin or ceramic, with visible textures simulating fabric folds, skin tone, and natural elements. The background is plain white, emphasizing the figure without any environmental context.

Thinking process:  
First, analyze the editing instructions to determine what can be changed. The instruction explicitly states:  
- "Transform the statue into a vintage-themed perfume bottle design" → This indicates that the **overall form** of the figure is to be reimagined as a **perfume bottle**, meaning the original human shape may be altered.  
- "Convert the jug into an ornate glass stopper" → The **large black jug** on her shoulder is to become a **stopper**, implying it will no longer function as a vessel carried by the figure but rather as a decorative cap.  
- "The flowing robe becomes an elegant bottle shape" → The **robe’s silhouette** is to be transformed into the **body of a bottle**, so the garment's structure is not preserved literally but repurposed.  
- "Develop a goose-shaped charm as a decorative accessory" → The **goose** is to become a **charm**, suggesting it is reduced in scale or stylized, but its **identity as a goose** must remain recognizable.  
- "Use earthy tones with gold accents" → Color palette changes are allowed, but **original color patterns** (e.g., red cloak, black jug) may be adapted within this scheme.  
- "Engrave grapevine patterns across the bottle" → New decorative motifs are introduced; these are **not present in the original**, so their addition does not conflict with retention.  
- "Add a detailed cardboard packaging featuring classical art motifs..." → This introduces **new scene elements**, so the **original background** (plain white) is not required to be retained.

Allowed Changes List:  
- The overall shape of the figure (human form) → can be transformed into a bottle shape  
- The large black jug → can be converted into a glass stopper  
- The robe → can be reshaped into the body of a bottle  
- The position and function of the basket of fruit → can be modified or integrated into the new design  
- The small jug under the arm → can be incorporated into the bottle design or omitted  
- The goose → can be transformed into a charm, though its form must remain identifiable  
- Background → can be replaced with packaging  
- Colors → can be adjusted to earthy tones with gold accents  
- Additional decorative elements (grapevines, packaging) → permitted  

Step 2 – Determine the elements that should remain unchanged  
Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements:  
- The **goose** is a distinct animal presence in the original image, positioned at the woman’s feet. It is a key identifying feature due to its unusual placement (a domestic bird accompanying a rural woman), contributing to the narrative and visual balance. Even if transformed into a charm, its **form as a goose** must be preserved for identity continuity.  
- The **basket of fruit** (especially the cluster of purple grapes, red apple, and green pear) is a central detail in the composition, symbolizing harvest and abundance. While the basket may be repositioned or stylized, the **presence and arrangement of the specific fruits** are critical to the scene’s theme and should not be lost.  
- The **heart-shaped engraving on the small jug** is a unique decorative element. Its presence adds symbolic depth and individuality to the object. Since it is a distinctive mark, it should be retained even if the jug is repurposed.  
- The **gold clasp on the cloak** is a small but notable detail indicating status or craftsmanship. Though minor, it contributes to the authenticity of the costume and should be preserved if possible.  

Functional/logical association elements:  
- The **relationship between the woman and the goose**: The goose is positioned at her feet, suggesting companionship or domestic life. If the goose is transformed into a charm, its **spatial relationship** (attached to the bottle) should reflect this connection. However, since the instruction allows transformation, the **functional role** (as a companion) is not strictly required to be preserved in literal terms, only its **visual identity**.  
- The **act of carrying the large jug** implies physical effort and balance. While the jug becomes a stopper, the **posture of lifting** may be abstracted, but the **direction of gaze and arm position** should retain some indication of upward motion.  

Non-modified element deduction:  
After excluding all allowed changes, the following **must be retained** based on visual coherence:  
- The **shape and positioning of the basket of fruit** — it is a prominent feature in the lower torso area and cannot be entirely removed without losing narrative context.  
- The **distinctive pattern of the grapes** — their clustered, spherical form is visually identifiable and should remain.  
- The **color contrast between the red cloak and brown tunic** — while colors may shift to earthy tones, the **relative color hierarchy** (red as accent) should be maintained.  
- The **presence of the small jug with the heart motif** — this is a unique identifier and must be preserved in some form.  
- The **goose’s anatomical features** (beak, wings, legs) — essential for recognition as a goose, even when miniaturized.  

Preservation Targets List:  
- The **cluster of purple grapes** in the basket  
- The **heart-shaped engraving** on the small terracotta jug  
- The **white goose with orange beak and webbed feet**  
- The **gold clasp** on the cloak  
- The **basket containing fruits (apple, pear, grapes)**  
- The **relative position of the basket** near the woman’s waist

    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The cluster of purple grapes is a core visual element in the basket, uniquely identifiable by their dense, spherical arrangement and deep purple coloration. These grapes are a signature feature of the harvest theme and distinguish this figure from others. Their absence would remove a key narrative and aesthetic component. Therefore, their presence and form must be preserved, even if stylized.

    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The heart-shaped engraving on the small jug is a distinctive decorative motif that serves as a unique identifier for the object. It is not common in typical jugs and adds symbolic value. Losing this detail would result in the loss of a key attribute that defines the jug’s character in the original image.

    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The white goose with an orange beak and webbed feet is a defining secondary character in the scene. Its presence at the woman’s feet is both spatially and narratively significant. Even if transformed into a charm, the basic form (head, beak, body, wings, legs) must remain to maintain recognition. This is a core identity feature of the original composition.

    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The gold clasp on the cloak is a small but important detail that adds authenticity to the costume. It is located at the neck and contrasts with the surrounding fabric. While subtle, it is a consistent feature across similar figurines and contributes to the visual richness. Its absence would reduce the fidelity of the costume representation.
    Question: Is there a gold-colored clasp visible at the neckline of the cloak?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The basket containing multiple fruits (including a red apple, green pear, and purple grapes) is a key accessory that conveys abundance and rural life. The combination of these specific fruits and their placement in a woven basket is a recognizable feature. Removing or altering this basket would disrupt the thematic integrity of the figure.
    Question: Is the basket holding a red apple, green pear, and purple grapes?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2

{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The relative position of the basket near the woman’s waist is crucial for maintaining the posture and balance of the figure. It is held in her left arm and sits against her side. Changing its location significantly would alter the dynamic of the pose and undermine the original composition.
