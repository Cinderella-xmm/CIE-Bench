**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a cream-colored woven handbag with a structured, rounded basket-like form. The bag features two curved handles made of the same woven material, which are attached to the top rim. The exterior texture consists of tightly coiled, horizontal ridges resembling rope or straw weaving, giving it a textured, tactile appearance. The interior lining is a soft beige satin fabric, visible due to the open top and slightly drawn drawstring closure. A large, dark gray ribbon bow is affixed to the front left side of the bag, adorned with a white artificial flower at its center. A smaller matching bow with a similar white flower is attached via a silver chain to the right handle. The background is a clean, minimalist white brick wall with even lighting, creating a neutral and bright setting. The overall composition is centered, with the bag placed on a flat white surface, casting a subtle shadow beneath.

**Step 1 – Determine allowed changes based on editing instructions**

Thinking process:  
The editing instruction explicitly transforms the handbag into a whimsical basket creature. This implies that the **form and function** of the handbag are to be reimagined metaphorically, not preserved literally. Key transformation elements include:
- "Turning the woven texture into scales" → the texture of the bag’s body can be altered from woven ridges to scale-like patterns.
- "Alter the gray ribbons to resemble elegant wings" → the ribbons can be reshaped or stylized into wing forms.
- "White flowers becoming eyes surrounded by ornate lashes" → the flowers can be reinterpreted as eyes, with added lashes.
- "Add a pair of delicate, sparkling antennas near the handle" → new elements (antennas) may be introduced.
- "Modify the chain into a serpentine tail" → the chain can be transformed into a flowing tail structure.

These transformations indicate that **the original structural identity** of the bag is being replaced with a fantastical interpretation. However, the instruction does **not** mention altering the **color scheme**, **position**, or **overall composition** of the scene, nor does it suggest removing the core visual components like the **ribbons**, **flowers**, or **chain**—only their **form and symbolic meaning** are changed.

Thus, while the **shape, texture, and functional interpretation** of the bag and its accessories are allowed to change, certain **visual elements** must remain **visually identifiable** in the edited version for consistency and recognition.

Allowed Changes List:  
- Woven texture → transformed into scale-like pattern  
- Gray ribbons → reshaped into wings  
- White flowers → transformed into eyes with lashes  
- Silver chain → modified into serpentine tail  
- Addition of antennae near the handle  
- Overall form of the bag → transformed into a creature (not retained as a handbag)

**Step 2 – Determine elements that should remain unchanged**

Thinking process:  
Despite the transformative nature of the edit, certain **core visual identifiers** must be preserved to maintain the connection between the original image and the edited version. These are derived through exclusion:

1. **Core recognition elements**:  
   - The **white artificial flower** is a key decorative element; although it becomes an eye, its **presence and color** must remain recognizable.  
   - The **gray ribbon bow** is a defining feature; even as a wing, its **color and material type** (satin-like) should be preserved.  
   - The **silver chain** is a distinct hardware element; though it becomes a tail, its **metallic sheen and link structure** should be traceable.  
   - The **cream-colored woven body** is the base of the object; even if scaled, its **overall shape and position** must remain consistent.

2. **Functional/logical association elements**:  
   - The **attachment points** of the ribbons and chain must remain logically consistent (e.g., the large bow stays on the front-left, the chain remains linked to the handle).  
   - The **relative positioning** of the elements (bow on front, chain hanging from handle) must be preserved to retain spatial coherence.

3. **Non-modified element deduction**:  
   - The **interior beige lining** is visible and part of the original design; while not central, it contributes to authenticity and should be retained unless obscured.  
   - The **white brick background** and **flat white surface** are neutral but contribute to context; they are not mentioned for change, so they should remain intact.  
   - The **brand watermark “JourFin LoveRibbon®”** is present and serves as a signature; it should be preserved unless explicitly removed.

Preservation Targets List:  
- The presence and placement of the large gray ribbon bow on the front-left side  
- The presence and placement of the small gray ribbon bow with white flower attached via chain to the right handle  
- The white artificial flower on the large bow  
- The white artificial flower on the small bow  
- The silver chain connecting the small bow to the handle  
- The cream-colored woven body of the bag (including its general shape and position)  
- The beige satin interior lining (visible at the top opening)  
- The white brick wall background and flat white surface  
- The brand watermark “JourFin LoveRibbon®” in the bottom-right corner

**Step 3 – Generate yes/no questions targeting key identifying visual elements**

Q1:  
Thinking process: The large gray ribbon bow is a defining decorative feature of the handbag. Its presence, color, and placement on the front-left side are critical for visual identification. Even when transformed into wings, its **original location and material characteristics** must be retained to ensure continuity. The bow's **dark gray color** and **folded ribbon structure** are unique identifiers. Losing this would break the visual anchor of the original design. Thus, its **presence and position** are core identity elements, warranting a weight of 3.  
Question: Is the large dark gray ribbon bow still present and positioned on the front-left side of the bag?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The white artificial flower on the large bow is a key detail that distinguishes the bag's decoration. It is centrally located within the bow and contrasts sharply with the gray ribbon. Even when transformed into an eye, the **presence of a white floral element** must remain visible to maintain continuity. Its **color and placement** are essential for recognition. This is a core decorative feature, thus weighted at 3.  
Question: Is the white artificial flower still visible and centered within the large gray ribbon bow?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The small gray ribbon bow with the white flower attached via chain is another critical accessory. Its **separate attachment** to the right handle via a silver chain is a distinctive feature. Even when transformed into a wing or tail, the **connection point and the presence of the chain** must be preserved to maintain logical continuity. The **chain's metallic appearance** and **link structure** are important for identification. This is a key accessory, hence a weight of 2.  
Question: Is the small gray ribbon bow with a white flower still attached to the right handle by a silver chain?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The silver chain is a functional and visual element that connects the small bow to the handle. Its **metallic sheen and segmented links** are specific to the original design. While it may become a tail, the **material and structure** must remain recognizable. This is an important accessory that supports the bag’s identity, making it a weight-2 element.  
Question: Is the silver chain still visibly connected to the small bow and the right handle?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The cream-colored woven body of the bag defines its overall form and texture. Even if transformed into scales, the **general shape, color, and position** of the bag must remain consistent. The **horizontal ridge pattern** and **rounded basket shape** are core to its identity. Losing this would make the object unrecognizable as the original bag. This is a foundational element, thus weighted at 3.  
Question: Is the bag’s body still cream-colored and shaped like a woven basket with horizontal ridges?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The beige satin interior lining is visible at the top opening and contributes to the bag’s internal design. While not central, its **color and fabric texture** are part of the original aesthetic. If removed or altered, it affects visual fidelity. This is a secondary detail but helps confirm the bag’s originality, so it is weighted at 1.  
Question: Is the beige satin interior lining still visible inside the top opening of the bag?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The background is a white brick wall with even lighting and a flat white surface. The instruction does not mention changing the environment, so it should remain unchanged. This provides context and contrast. Altering it would affect scene consistency. This is a minor but important environmental detail, thus weighted at 1.  
Question: Is the background still a white brick wall with a flat white surface beneath the bag?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q8:  
Thinking process: The brand watermark “JourFin LoveRibbon®” is present in the bottom-right corner. It is a signature element and should be preserved unless explicitly removed. Its **text and logo** are part of the image’s identity. Removing it would alter the source attribution. This is a minor but important branding detail, thus weighted at 1.  
Question: Is the text “JourFin LoveRibbon®” still visible in the bottom-right corner of the image?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1
