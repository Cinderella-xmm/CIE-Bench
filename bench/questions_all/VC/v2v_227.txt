Description of reference image: The subject is a dynamic roadside scene featuring a red sport motorcycle and a blue vintage pickup truck traveling side by side on a paved road. The rider on the motorcycle is wearing full black protective gear, including a black helmet, leather jacket, gloves, and pants, with a crouched riding posture leaning forward over the handlebars. The motorcycle is a modern sportbike with a sleek aerodynamic design, sharp angular bodywork, dual headlights, a transparent windscreen, and visible front suspension forks. It has a bright red color with black accents on the wheels and exhaust. The blue vintage truck is an older model with a boxy shape, rusted surface, faded light blue paint, round headlights, chrome grille, and a single side mirror. The truck’s tires are worn, and the wheel rims show signs of aging. The driver inside the truck is partially visible, wearing a hat and looking ahead. The background consists of a blurred roadside landscape with greenery and a partly cloudy sky, suggesting motion. The road surface shows motion blur, emphasizing speed.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions to determine what can be changed. The instruction specifies transforming the motorcycle and truck into simplified, cartoon-like versions with a cute aesthetic, which allows for changes in form, proportion, and detail level. However, it explicitly requires retaining key features: the red sport motorcycle, the rider dressed in black gear, and the blue vintage truck. This means the core identity of these objects must remain recognizable despite stylization. The instruction also allows for exaggerated proportions and expressive characteristics, so details like exact dimensions or realistic textures can be altered. The background is to be transparent, so environmental elements (road, sky, trees) are not required to be preserved. The thick white outline, flat colors, circular base, and dynamic extension beyond the circle are stylistic additions, not original elements, so they do not affect retention criteria. Therefore, only the specified key features—color, type, and identity of the motorcycle, rider, and truck—are protected from change.

Allowed Changes List:
- Shape and proportions of the motorcycle and truck (can be exaggerated or simplified)
- Texture and surface details (e.g., rust, scratches, reflections)
- Background elements (road, sky, trees, motion blur)
- Rider's facial features (since helmet covers face)
- Exact positioning of components (as long as core identity remains)
- Realistic lighting and shadows
- Overall composition layout (within context of sticker format)

Thinking process:
Core recognition elements: The red sport motorcycle and blue vintage truck are iconic vehicles with distinct visual identities. The red color of the motorcycle is a core identifier—it distinguishes it from other motorcycles and is essential for recognition. Similarly, the blue color of the truck, combined with its vintage design (boxy shape, round headlights, chrome grille), makes it uniquely identifiable. The rider’s black gear is a functional and visual signature—black leather jacket, gloves, pants, and helmet are standard for sportbike riders and contribute to the character’s identity. These elements are critical for maintaining the original scene’s narrative and visual logic.

Functional/logical association elements: The rider’s posture (leaning forward) is functionally tied to the act of riding a sportbike at speed. While the pose may be exaggerated in chibi style, the forward-leaning orientation must be retained to preserve the action logic. The relative position of the motorcycle and truck—side-by-side on the road—must be maintained to reflect the original interaction between the two vehicles. Changing this would disrupt the implied motion and relationship.

Non modified element deduction: After excluding allowed changes (such as texture, proportion, and background), the remaining unmentioned but visually present elements that define the subjects’ identity must be preserved. For example, the presence of the windscreen on the motorcycle, the dual headlights, and the specific shape of the truck’s grille are not mentioned as changeable, so they should be retained in some form. The rider’s full black outfit is explicitly required to be kept, so all components of the gear must be present.

Preservation Targets List:
- The red color of the sport motorcycle
- The blue color of the vintage truck
- The rider’s black helmet, jacket, gloves, and pants
- The presence of the motorcycle’s windscreen
- The presence of the truck’s round headlights and chrome grille
- The rider’s forward-leaning posture
- The side-by-side positioning of the motorcycle and truck

Q1:  
Thinking process: The red color of the motorcycle is a core identity feature. In the original image, the motorcycle is distinctly red, which differentiates it from other types of bikes and is essential for recognition. If the color were changed to another hue, the vehicle would no longer be identifiable as the same object. This is a key visual identifier, making it a 3-point element.
Question: Is the motorcycle red in color?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The blue color of the truck is a defining characteristic. The vintage truck in the original image is painted light blue, and this color is central to its identity. A change to a different color would make it unrecognizable as the same vehicle. This is a core recognition feature, thus weighted at 3 points.
Question: Is the truck blue in color?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The rider is wearing a black helmet, which is a key part of their appearance and safety gear. The helmet is fully visible and covers the head, forming a distinct silhouette. Its presence is essential for identifying the rider as a motorcyclist in full gear. Removing or changing its color would alter the rider’s identity.
Question: Is the rider wearing a black helmet?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The rider’s black leather jacket is a core component of their attire and contributes to the overall look of a professional motorcyclist. The jacket is clearly visible and forms a significant portion of the rider’s upper body. Its absence or replacement with a different color or material would break the continuity of the character’s identity.
Question: Is the rider wearing a black leather jacket?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The motorcycle has a transparent windscreen, which is a functional and visual feature of sportbikes. It is positioned above the handlebars and is clearly visible in the original image. Its presence helps identify the bike as a modern sport model. Removing it would change the bike’s classification.
Question: Does the motorcycle have a transparent windscreen?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The truck has round headlights, which are a distinctive design feature of vintage models. These headlights are located on the front bumper and are clearly visible. Their shape and placement are key identifiers of the truck’s era and style. Altering them would affect the truck’s authenticity.
Question: Does the truck have round headlights?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The rider is in a forward-leaning posture, which is typical for sportbike riding and indicates motion. This posture is essential for conveying the action and dynamics of the scene. Even in a chibi style, the direction and angle of the lean must be preserved to maintain the sense of movement.
Question: Is the rider leaning forward over the handlebars?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q8:  
Thinking process: The motorcycle and truck are positioned side by side on the road, indicating a parallel movement. This spatial relationship is crucial for the narrative of the scene—two vehicles traveling together. Changing their relative positions would disrupt the intended interaction.
Question: Are the motorcycle and truck positioned side by side?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2
