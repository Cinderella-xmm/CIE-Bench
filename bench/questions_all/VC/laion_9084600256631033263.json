      "thinking_process": "The \"DATSUN\" badge is the primary brand identifier of the vehicle and appears centrally on the front grille. Its presence and position are critical to recognizing the car as a Datsun. Even when transformed into an embossed design on a decanter, the text must remain legible and in the same relative location to maintain identity. Losing this would make the object unidentifiable as a Datsun product, making it a core identity element.",
      "question": "Is the \"DATSUN\" text visibly present and centered on the front of the decanter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The \"240Z\" script on the side fender is a unique model identifier specific to this car variant. It distinguishes it from other Datsun models. The instruction specifies embedding the model’s emblem, which includes this text. Removing or relocating it would misrepresent the model, so its presence and approximate location on the side must be preserved.",
      "question": "Is the \"240Z\" script visible on the side of the decanter near the front wheel well?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The overall silhouette of the Datsun 240Z—characterized by a long hood, low roofline, and compact rear—is what makes it visually distinct among classic sports cars. The instruction states the bottle should reflect the car’s curves, meaning the general shape must be preserved. If the bottle lacks these proportions, it fails to represent the original car accurately.",
      "question": "Does the decanter maintain the long hood and short rear deck proportions of the original car?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The vertical slat grille is a signature design feature of the Datsun 240Z, contributing to its front-end identity. Although the grille may be stylized into the bottle’s neck or base, the pattern must still be recognizable. Preserving this texture ensures the design remains faithful to the original car’s aesthetic.",
      "question": "Are vertical slats visible on the front of the decanter, mimicking the original grille pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The central placement of the brand emblem on the front is a consistent design choice across Datsun vehicles. Even in transformation, maintaining this spatial relationship ensures correct brand representation. If the emblem is moved to the side or top, it breaks the expected visual logic of the original car.",
      "question": "Is the \"DATSUN\" emblem positioned centrally on the front face of the decanter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
