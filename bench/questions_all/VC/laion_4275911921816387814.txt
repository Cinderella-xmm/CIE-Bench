**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a curved dagger with a distinctively shaped, ivory-colored hilt made of segmented, polished material resembling bone or ivory. The hilt has a rounded pommel at the end and a smooth, ergonomic grip that tapers toward the guard. The guard is ornate, metallic, and silver-toned, featuring floral and geometric engravings. The blade is long, curved, and made of metal with intricate black filigree patterns etched into a silver-gray surface, forming a dense, lace-like design across its entire length. The tip of the blade is pointed and slightly flared. The overall form suggests a traditional Middle Eastern or South Asian dagger, such as a *jambiya* or *khanjar*. The background is a plain, neutral light gray, untextured, and evenly lit, providing high contrast to the object.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction explicitly states:  
- "Convert the dagger into a plush toy version" → This means the **form** of the subject changes from a real metal weapon to a soft textile object.  
- "Replace the blade with soft, silver-gray fabric embroidered with black patterns" → The **material** and **texture** of the blade are changed, but the **pattern** (black on silver-gray) must be preserved in design.  
- "Use faux ivory-like fabric for the hilt, ensuring rounded, smooth edges" → The **hilt's shape and color** are retained in form and tone, but material changes.  
- "Stuff it to maintain volume and soften details" → The **three-dimensional shape** is preserved, but **sharpness** and **rigidity** are reduced.  
- "Place the plush toy against a solid color backdrop for gentle contrast" → The **background** can change, but should remain simple and non-distracting.  

From this, we infer:
- The **subject’s identity** (dagger) is preserved, but **material and texture** are replaced.
- The **overall silhouette**, **curve of the blade**, **shape of the hilt**, **guard design**, and **pattern layout** are implied to be preserved in form.
- **Color scheme** (ivory hilt, silver-gray blade with black patterns) is preserved in intent.
- **Background** is allowed to change, so it is not a retention requirement.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
- Material of the blade (metal → soft fabric)  
- Material of the hilt (bone/ivory → faux ivory fabric)  
- Texture of all surfaces (smooth metal → soft, stuffed textile)  
- Background (neutral gray → solid color)  
- Sharpness and rigidity (replaced by softness and volume)  
- Surface finish (reflective metal → matte fabric)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
We now exclude the allowed changes and identify what **must remain unchanged** based on:

1. **Core recognition elements**:  
   - The **distinctive curved shape** of the blade is essential to identifying this as a *jambiya*-style dagger. If straightened or altered in curvature, it would no longer be recognizable as this type of weapon.  
   - The **ornate guard** with its **floral and geometric engraving** is a key decorative feature and part of the cultural identity. Its **presence and position** must be preserved.  
   - The **segmented, ivory-colored hilt** with its **rounded pommel** is a defining visual trait—its **shape and segmentation pattern** are core to recognition.  
   - The **black filigree pattern** on the blade is not just decoration; it is a signature aesthetic element. While the medium changes, the **pattern itself** must be preserved in structure and placement.

2. **Functional/logical association elements**:  
   - The **relative positioning** of the hilt, guard, and blade must remain consistent—this maintains the logical structure of a dagger. A misaligned guard or misplaced blade would break functional coherence.  
   - The **curved trajectory** of the blade from hilt to tip must be preserved—it defines the weapon’s action and balance.

3. **Non-modified element deduction**:  
   - Even though materials change, the **spatial relationships** between parts (e.g., guard connecting hilt to blade), **proportions**, and **visual hierarchy** (e.g., blade being longer than hilt) must remain.  
   - The **overall silhouette** must be maintained—any drastic shortening or elongation would alter identity.  
   - The **tip of the blade** must remain pointed, even if softened—this is a critical functional detail.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
- The **curved shape** of the blade  
- The **segmented, ivory-colored hilt** with **rounded pommel**  
- The **position and design** of the **ornate guard** with floral/geometric patterns  
- The **black filigree pattern** on the blade (layout and density)  
- The **relative proportions** between hilt, guard, and blade  
- The **overall silhouette** and **orientation** (diagonal placement from top-left to bottom-right)  
- The **pointed tip** of the blade

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The **curved shape** of the blade is the most iconic feature distinguishing this dagger from straight-bladed weapons. It is a core identity element—without the curve, the object would not be recognizable as a jambiya-style dagger. The instruction allows material change but not shape modification, so preserving the curve is essential. This is a 3-point element because losing it would fundamentally alter the object’s identity.
    Question: Is the blade visibly curved in the same manner as in the original image, extending from the guard to a pointed tip?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The **segmented appearance** of the hilt, with its distinct sections resembling bone or ivory, is a unique visual trait. This pattern is central to the dagger’s aesthetic and historical authenticity. Even if made of fabric, the segmentation must remain visible to preserve recognition. Changing it to a smooth surface would lose this key detail. This is a 3-point element due to its role in identification.
    Question: Does the hilt retain the segmented, block-like pattern along its length, similar to the original?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The **ornate guard** with its **floral and geometric engravings** is a hallmark of traditional craftsmanship. Its presence and detailed design are crucial for authenticity. Although the material changes, the **design layout** must be preserved. Removing or simplifying it would reduce the cultural and artistic value. This is a 2-point element as it is important for visual fidelity and style.
    Question: Is the guard decorated with intricate floral and geometric patterns, matching the original design?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The **black filigree pattern** on the blade is not just decorative—it is a defining visual motif. The pattern's density and distribution are unique and must be preserved in the plush version, even if rendered in embroidery. Altering the pattern would make the object visually inconsistent with the original. This is a 3-point element because it is a key identifier of the blade’s design.
    Question: Is the blade covered with a dense black filigree pattern, matching the original in layout and coverage?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The **relative proportions** between the hilt, guard, and blade determine the dagger’s balance and recognizability. The blade is significantly longer than the hilt, and the guard connects them at a specific point. Altering these proportions would distort the object’s form. This is a 2-point element because it affects structural accuracy and visual coherence.
    Question: Are the proportions between the hilt, guard, and blade preserved, with the blade being longer than the hilt?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The **pointed tip** of the blade is a functional and visual endpoint. Even in a plush version, it must remain pointed to reflect the original’s form. A blunt or rounded tip would deviate from the source. This is a 1-point element as it is a minor but necessary detail for fidelity.
    Question: Does the blade end in a pointed tip, consistent with the original?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}
{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The **overall silhouette** and **diagonal orientation** from top-left to bottom-right are key to the composition. Changing the angle or cropping the object would affect visual consistency. This is a 1-point element as it pertains to framing and presentation rather than core identity.
    Question: Is the dagger positioned diagonally across the frame, from upper left to lower right, as in the original?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
