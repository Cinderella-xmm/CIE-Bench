      "thinking_process": "The mechanical eyepatch is a core identification feature of the central character, defined by its metallic texture, rectangular shape, and visible screws. Its presence is explicitly required in the editing instruction (\"retain the central character’s eyepatch\"). Losing this would make the character unrecognizable, especially in a franchise where such prosthetics are iconic. Therefore, this is a critical identity-preserving element, warranting a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the mechanical eyepatch with visible screws and metallic surface present on the central character’s right eye?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The book held by the central character is a functional object that defines his action and role in the scene. Even if modified with blood-red streaks, the act of holding a book must remain. Removing it or replacing it with another object would violate the continuity of the character’s behavior and the narrative logic of the scene. Thus, its presence is essential, making it a key functional element worth 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the central character holding an open book in both hands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The visible script on the book cover, resembling traditional Chinese calligraphy, is a unique visual detail that adds cultural and narrative depth. It contributes to the identity of the book and the world-building. Although the instruction allows for blood-red streaks on the edges, the script itself is not mentioned as removable, so it must be retained. This is a secondary but identifiable feature, important for coherence, hence 2 points.",
      "question": "Is there visible Chinese-style calligraphy on the cover of the book held by the central character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The central character’s short black hair is a defining physical trait. While the instruction does not specify hairstyle preservation, changing it fundamentally would alter identity. Since no allowance is made for altering hair, and the original image clearly shows this trait, it must be retained. Hair color and length are core identity markers in anime, especially when paired with other features like the eyepatch. This is a key identifier, thus 3 points.",
      "question": "Does the central character have short, straight black hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The presence of the four supporting characters in the background — particularly their distinct appearances (white hair, purple hair, blue hair, etc.) — establishes the group dynamic and narrative context. The instruction does not mention removing them, only transforming styles. Their inclusion maintains the original composition’s integrity. Though they may wear trench coats, their identities must be preserved via recognizable features. This is a major scene element, vital for consistency, hence 2 points.",
      "question": "Are there four distinct supporting characters visible in the background, including one with white hair, one with purple hair, one with blue hair, and one with dark hair and red eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The central character’s facial expression — calm, neutral, with a slight downward gaze — is part of his emotional tone and character portrayal. While lighting may change, the expression is a key detail contributing to mood and identity. Altering it significantly could misrepresent the character’s demeanor. This is a minor but meaningful detail affecting coherence, so it receives 1 point.",
      "question": "Does the central character have a calm, neutral facial expression with a slightly downward gaze?",
