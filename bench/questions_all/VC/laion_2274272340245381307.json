      "thinking_process": "The girl's large black-rimmed glasses are a distinctive facial accessory that contributes to her scientist persona. Their shape (round lenses, thick black frame) is a key visual identifier in the original image. If they are removed or altered, the character’s identity shifts significantly. Although the instruction allows replacement with a teddy bear, the presence of the glasses in the original image makes them a notable detail that could be retained or omitted. Since the instruction does not specify their removal, checking their presence helps verify consistency with the original visual design. This is a minor detail, but visually prominent, hence assigned 2 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The white lab coat is a central costume element that defines the girl's role as a scientist. Its color (white), collar shape, and visible button on the left side are specific details. While the instruction replaces her with a teddy bear scientist, the lab coat's visual presence in the original image makes it a key component of the scientist aesthetic. If absent in the edited version, it may indicate a deviation from the original concept. This is a significant detail in defining the character’s identity, so its retention is important for visual continuity, even if not required. Assigned 2 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The dark green chalkboard background is a consistent environmental feature throughout the image. Its deep green hue and matte texture provide contrast for the red and white chalk doodles. Although the instruction allows enrichment with new symbols, the background color and texture are foundational to the educational setting. If changed to another color or texture, the visual context shifts. While not required to be preserved, its retention ensures thematic continuity. This is a major environmental element, so its presence is important for scene coherence. Assigned 2 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The word \"CURIOSITY\" written in uppercase letters is a central textual element in the image, positioned near the center-right. Its font style (handwritten, uneven spacing) and placement contribute to the playful educational theme. Although the instruction mentions adding more text and symbols, this specific word may be retained or replaced. Checking its presence helps assess whether key thematic elements from the original are preserved. This is a core thematic word, so its retention affects the message conveyed. Assigned 3 points.",

Its features—round head, small ears, stitched eyes, and red bow tie—are distinctive. Although the instruction introduces a new anthropomorphic teddy bear scientist, this original doodle may be retained or replaced. Its presence adds to the whimsical tone.
