      "thinking_process": "The fan-shaped crown of tightly coiled braids is the defining hairstyle feature, symbolizing cultural identity and structural complexity. Its unique radial arrangement is a core visual identifier; if lost or altered in shape, the subject would no longer reflect the original’s distinctiveness. Since the instruction specifies transforming it into carved patterns, its **form and symmetry** must be preserved. This is a 3-point element due to its role in identity recognition.",

      "thinking_process": "The large circular beaded earrings with concentric designs are prominent accessories and are specified to be rendered in painted detail.

      "thinking_process": "The horizontal band of multicolored beadwork around the neckline is a distinctive garment feature, part of the vibrant attire that must be translated into carved patterns.

      "thinking_process": "The vertical geometric patterns on the front of the garment are part of the traditional textile design, which must be rendered as intricately carved patterns.

      "thinking_process": "The subject’s pose and gaze direction (three-quarter view, looking slightly to the right) establish the composition and emotional tone.
