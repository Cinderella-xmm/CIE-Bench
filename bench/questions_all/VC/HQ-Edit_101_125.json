      "thinking_process": "The round wire-rimmed spectacles are a defining feature of the elderly gentleman’s appearance, contributing significantly to his identity. Their distinctive circular shape and thin metal frame are key visual markers. If lost or altered in form (e.g., changed to square or thick frames), the character would no longer be recognizably the same individual. This is a core identity element, hence a weight of 3 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The white hair and facial hair (mustache and goatee) are iconic features that define the subject’s age and appearance. Their presence and specific arrangement are essential for recognition. Removing or altering them (e.g., turning gray or changing shape) would fundamentally change the character’s identity. This is a core recognition element, warranting a weight of 3 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The gesture of holding the newspaper open across the lap is a functional action that defines the scene’s purpose—reading. Even if the newspaper is oversized or illustrated, the hand placement and orientation must reflect this action. Changing this would break the logical continuity of the scene. This is a key functional element, so it carries a weight of 2 points.",

Its location and form contribute to the scene’s logic. Moving it or changing its material would disrupt the visual consistency and implied story. Though not central to identity, it is a significant contextual detail, thus worth 2 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The wooden bench provides the structural foundation of the scene. Its presence and basic form (armrests, slats, backrest) are necessary to maintain the setting. Altering it into a different type of seat or removing it entirely would invalidate the park context. This is a critical environmental element, hence a weight of 2 points.",

While colors might be softened in pastel tones, the **specific layering and color contrast** must remain to preserve the original visual identity. This is a secondary but important detail affecting coherence, thus assigned 1 point.",

This subtle positioning helps convey personality and balance. Changing it (e.g., legs flat or uncrossed) would alter the impression of tranquility. Though minor, it contributes to visual consistency, so it is given 1 point.",
