### Step 1 - Description of Reference Image and Allowed Changes List:

**Description of Reference Image:**  
The image features a plate containing a sliced mango with cubed pieces still attached to the peel, a whole mango, a half-sliced lime, and a small bowl of red chili powder. All items are arranged neatly on a wooden plate placed on a wooden surface. The vibrant yellow of the mango contrasts with the green of the lime and the orange-red chili powder.

**Thinking Process:**  
The editing instructions specify transforming the mango into a whimsical figurine, increasing the size of the cut pieces, adding a shiny 3D effect, and giving the lime and chili powder bowl a cartoon-like design. The scene is also instructed to be positioned on a shelf. This means the subject's form, size, and texture can be altered, along with the scene's placement.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
1. Increase the size of the cut mango pieces.  
2. Add a shiny 3D effect to the mango pieces.  
3. Transform the lime and chili powder bowl into a cartoon-like design.  
4. Position the entire setup on a shelf instead of the current wooden surface.

### Step 2 - Determination of Elements That Should Remain Unchanged:

**Thinking Process:**  
- **Core Recognition Elements:** The core identity of the mango (its yellow color and cubed arrangement), the lime (green color and sliced appearance), and the chili powder (orange-red color and granular texture) must be retained. These are essential for recognizing the objects despite the whimsical transformation.
- **Functional/Logical Association Elements:** The relative positions of the objects on the plate should be maintained to preserve the logical arrangement. The plate itself should remain as it serves as the base for the whimsical figurine.
- **Remaining Elements:** The wooden texture of the plate and the natural lighting should be kept to maintain visual coherence.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
1. The yellow color and cubed arrangement of the mango.  
2. The green color and sliced appearance of the lime.  
3. The orange-red color and granular texture of the chili powder.  
4. The relative positions of the objects on the plate.  
5. The wooden texture of the plate.

### Step 3 - Generation of Yes/No Questions:

**Q1:**  
Thinking process: The yellow color and cubed arrangement are key identifiers of the mango. Losing this would make it unrecognizable as a mango, hence a core identity feature worth 3 points.

Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

**Q2:**  
Thinking process: The green color and sliced appearance are crucial for recognizing the lime. Changing this would alter the identity of the lime, making it an important element worth 2 points.

Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

**Q3:**  
Thinking process: The orange-red color and granular texture are essential for identifying the chili powder. Altering these would make it unrecognizable, thus a core identity feature worth 3 points.

Weight: 3  

**Q4:**  
Thinking process: The relative positions of the objects on the plate are necessary for maintaining the logical arrangement. Changing this would disrupt the scene's coherence, making it an important element worth 2 points.
