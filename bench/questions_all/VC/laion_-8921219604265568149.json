      "thinking_process": "The presence of the **clock face on the left bell tower** is a unique identifying feature of the cathedral. It is located at a specific height and position, and its existence distinguishes this structure from others with similar towers. If removed or altered, the cathedral would lose a critical point of identification. This is a core recognition element and thus carries high weight.",
      "question": "Is the clock face present on the upper section of the left bell tower?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The **two visible bells** in the right bell tower are distinctive functional and visual elements. Their presence in open arches is a key detail that confirms the tower's purpose and architectural design. Removing them would alter the tower’s identity and function, making it unrecognizable. This is a core functional and visual feature.",
      "question": "Are there two bells visible in the arches of the right bell tower?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The **rose window** above the central entrance is a hallmark of Baroque church architecture and a defining feature of this cathedral’s façade. Its intricate design and central placement make it a primary identifier. Altering or removing it would fundamentally change the building’s character and recognition.",
      "question": "Is there a circular stained-glass window with a floral or star-like pattern centered above the main entrance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The **cross at the apex of the central gable** is a symbolic and architectural signature of the cathedral. Its position at the very top is consistent across views and is essential for religious and structural identification. Without it, the building loses its spiritual and architectural identity.",
      "question": "Is there a cross positioned at the highest point of the central roofline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The **three-door configuration**—one large central door flanked by two smaller ones—is a structural and compositional element that defines the cathedral’s frontal symmetry. Changing the number or position of doors would disrupt the balance and recognizability of the façade. This is a key architectural feature.",
      "question": "Are there three doors on the façade: one large central door and two smaller side doors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The **symmetrical arrangement of columns and pilasters** on the façade is a hallmark of Baroque design and contributes to the cathedral’s visual harmony. While minor decorative details may be simplified in the miniature, the fundamental symmetry and column layout must be preserved to maintain architectural accuracy.",
      "question": "Is the façade symmetrically divided by vertical columns and pilasters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The **left bell tower has a distinct pinkish dome** with a small cross at its peak. This color and shape are part of the tower’s unique profile and help distinguish it from the right tower. While the material may change to resin, the dome’s shape and color should remain consistent to preserve visual identity.",
      "question": "Does the left bell tower have a pinkish dome with a cross on top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "thinking_process": "The **building on the right side with balconies and wrought-iron railings** provides contextual spatial information and helps anchor the cathedral in its urban setting. Although the scene is miniaturized, the relative position and architectural style of this adjacent building should be preserved to maintain environmental coherence.",
      "question": "Is there a multi-story building with balconies and wrought-iron railings to the right of the cathedral?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
