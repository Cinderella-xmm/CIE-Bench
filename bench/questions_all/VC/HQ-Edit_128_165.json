      "thinking_process": "The wooden ceiling beams are a core architectural feature of the original image, defining the structural context. Their presence, number, spacing, and dark brown weathered texture are distinctive and contribute to the rustic aesthetic. Changing their shape, color, or removing them entirely would fundamentally alter the scene’s identity. Since the instruction does not mention modifying the ceiling, these beams must be preserved. This is a key structural element with high visual weight.",
      "question": "Are the two visible dark brown wooden ceiling beams, one running diagonally and one vertically, present and positioned as in the original image?",

      "thinking_process": "The white textured stucco wall is a defining background element that contrasts with the lantern’s warm glow. Its rough, uneven surface is a key detail contributing to the ambiance. Since the instruction does not specify changing the wall, and the jellyfish would appear in the same space, the wall texture must remain unchanged to maintain environmental authenticity. This is a major scene element affecting visual coherence.",
      "question": "Is the white, hand-textured stucco wall visible on the left side of the image, showing irregular surface imperfections and subtle brushwork marks?",

      "thinking_process": "The shadow pattern projected by the lantern onto the ceiling and wall is a critical visual consequence of the original lighting setup. It forms a radial, star-like design due to the lantern’s cut-outs. Although the lantern is being replaced, the instruction implies the same light source effect but in a different form. However, since the scene is not explicitly changed to underwater, the **original shadow pattern** must be preserved unless redefined. But note: the instruction says “make it float gracefully in an ethereal underwater realm,” which suggests a full scene change. However, since the original scene is not mentioned as changed, we assume the **shadow pattern** must still be consistent with the original lighting direction and intensity. This is a key lighting interaction element.",
      "question": "Is the shadow pattern on the ceiling and wall composed of a radial, star-shaped lattice formed by the lantern’s cut-out design, matching the exact geometric configuration of the lantern’s panels?",

Since the instruction does not mention altering the room structure, this corner must remain unchanged to preserve spatial logic. This is a secondary but important structural detail.",

      "thinking_process": "The chain connecting the lantern to the ceiling is a functional and visual link between the object and its support. Although the lantern is being transformed, the chain’s presence and attachment point are necessary to maintain the illusion of suspension. If removed, the jellyfish might appear to float without cause. Since the instruction doesn’t mention changing the suspension mechanism, it should be preserved. This is a minor but logical detail.",

      "thinking_process": "The light source within the lantern creates a warm, focused glow that illuminates the interior and casts light through the cut-outs. Although the new jellyfish will emit bioluminescence, the original light source’s **direction and intensity** must be consistent with the existing shadow pattern. The light must originate from within the object and project outward in the same way. This is a functional lighting element tied to the scene’s realism.",
