      "thinking_process": "The circular logo with a navy blue \"C\" shape enclosing a red semicircle is the most iconic visual identifier of the brand on the shoe. It is explicitly stated in the instruction to be placed on the front of the can. Losing this exact shape and color combination would result in the loss of brand identity, making the can unrecognizable as derived from this specific shoe. Therefore, it is a core identity element and must be preserved exactly.",
      "question": "Is the circular logo featuring a navy blue \"C\" shape with a red semicircle at the top present on the front of the energy drink can?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The navy blue mesh pattern is a defining texture of the shoe's upper and is explicitly instructed to be used as the primary surface texture of the can. This texture gives the can its visual authenticity and connection to the original shoe. Altering or omitting this mesh pattern would break the continuity of the design transformation, making the can visually disconnected from the source.",
      "question": "Does the energy drink can feature the navy blue mesh texture across its main body surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The laces are described as being transformed into embossed texture around the can. Their arrangement, thickness, and crossing pattern are critical to maintaining the visual essence of the original shoe. If the lace structure is simplified or changed, the design loses its reference to the shoe’s functional aesthetic. Thus, the **specific configuration** of the laces must be preserved.",
      "question": "Are the navy blue laces depicted as raised embossed ridges wrapping around the middle section of the can in their original crisscross pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The three navy blue stripes on the white midsole are a signature design element, reminiscent of Adidas branding. The instruction specifies they should form a dynamic pattern on the bottom half of the can. Their number, color, and alignment are essential to maintaining the visual link to the shoe. Changing their count or position would disrupt the design logic.",
      "question": "Are three navy blue stripes arranged horizontally across the lower portion of the can, matching the original shoe's stripe layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The red color appears in two key places on the original shoe: the logo’s semicircle and the \"EQT\" tag. The instruction uses red for the \"Kickstart\" text, implying the red color is a core part of the brand’s visual language. While the text itself is new, the **presence and use of red** as a branding accent must be retained to maintain consistency with the original shoe’s color scheme.",
      "question": "Is the word \"Kickstart\" displayed in red lettering on the upper portion of the can?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
