### Step 1: Analyze the Original Image and Allowed Changes

#### Description of Reference Image:
The subject is a parking meter prominently placed in the foreground, with a distinct design including a "PARKING" label, a coin slot, and a sticker/logo reading "ComsiAcara." The parking meter stands upright on a pole. In the background, there is an urban street scene with buildings, parked cars, pedestrians, lampposts, and road markings. The lighting suggests a sunny day with shadows cast on the sidewalk.

#### Thinking process:
The editing instructions aim to replace the city street background with a desert highway while keeping the parking meter as the central focus. This means that the parking meter's physical attributes and immediate surroundings must stay intact, while the broader contextual environment is subject to change.

#### Allowed Changes List:
1. The urban street background can be replaced with a desert highway backdrop.
2. Elements such as the building facades, vehicles, street lamps, and pedestrians can be removed or altered to fit the new setting.
3. The atmosphere and lighting may be adjusted to match the heat haze effect typical of a desert environment.

### Step 2: Determine the Elements That Should Remain Unchanged

#### Thinking process:
Core recognition elements include the parking meter's design, labels, stickers, and position on the pole. Functional/logical elements encompass the placement of the parking meter on the ground, ensuring it appears logically positioned even in a desert setting. Remaining visual details, such as the sticker text and general meter structure, should also be preserved for coherence.

#### Preservation Targets List:
1. The parking meter's design, labels ("PARKING"), and sticker/logo ("ComsiAcara").
2. The parking meter's vertical position and attachment to the pole.
3. The parking meter's structural integrity and proportions.
4. The shadow cast by the parking meter.
