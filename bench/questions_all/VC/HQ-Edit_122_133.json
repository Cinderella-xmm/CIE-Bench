      "thinking_process": "The cardinal’s bright red plumage is its most iconic identifying feature, universally recognized as the defining trait of the Northern Cardinal. Losing this color would make the bird unidentifiable as a cardinal, regardless of other details. The red must be preserved even if transformed into a figurine, as it is the core identity marker.",
      "question": "Is the cardinal’s body predominantly bright red with a black facial mask?",

      "thinking_process": "The blue jay’s distinctive blue crest and barred wing pattern are critical for species identification. These features are unique among North American birds and must be retained to preserve the bird’s identity. Even in anthropomorphic form, the blue and white pattern must be present.",
      "question": "Does the blue jay have a blue crest and wings with alternating blue and white bars?",

      "thinking_process": "The presence of snow on the birds’ heads and backs is a key environmental detail from the original image, reinforcing the winter theme. Although the snow may be reimagined in the shadow box, its presence on the birds must be maintained to preserve continuity with the original scene.",
      "question": "Is there visible snow resting on the cardinal’s head and back?",

      "thinking_process": "The blue jay’s beak is black and slightly curved, distinguishing it from the cardinal’s orange-red beak. This morphological detail is essential for accurate species representation. Even in stylized form, the beak color and shape must remain consistent.",
      "question": "Does the blue jay have a black beak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The pine branch structure beneath each bird provides ecological context and anchors the scene. Though the branches may be stylized in the shadow box, their basic form — including needle-like foliage and snow-covered limbs — must be retained to maintain visual coherence with the original image.",
      "question": "Are the birds perched on snow-covered pine branches with visible needles?",
