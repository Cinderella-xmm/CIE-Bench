**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a terracotta horse sculpture, likely from the Tang Dynasty, standing on a rectangular base. The horse is depicted in a dynamic pose with its left front leg raised, suggesting movement or prancing. Its body is predominantly off-white with traces of faded red-orange pigment, particularly visible on the saddle, bridle, and along the edges of the mane and tail. The mane flows down the neck in long, wavy strands, and the tail is draped over the rear. A saddle cloth with pleated folds and decorative elements is positioned on the back, featuring stylized patterns and small spherical embellishments. The head is elongated with large, expressive eyes, flared nostrils, and a slightly open mouth. The ears are upright and pointed. The legs are slender yet strong, with hooves clearly defined. The surface shows signs of age, including chipping, wear, and discoloration. The background is neutral gray to black gradient, with no additional objects or scenery.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction explicitly states: *"Reimagine the horse sculpture as a high-end collectible product packaging."* This indicates that the **subject’s form will be transformed**—it will no longer be just a standalone sculpture but encased within a new structure (a transparent showcase box). Therefore, the **original physical context** (e.g., isolated on a plain base) is not required to remain unchanged.  

Key changes allowed by the instruction:
- Encasement in a **transparent showcase box** → outer container added
- Addition of **gold accents** → decorative elements on the box
- Creation of a **modern brand logo** → new graphic element
- Placement on a **black base stand** → replacement of original base
- Addition of an **ancient Chinese motif backdrop** inside the box → interior design change
- **Magnetic closure** → functional feature of the box

These modifications involve altering the **presentation environment**, **supporting structure**, and **contextual framing** of the sculpture. However, they do **not** specify changing the **horse itself**—its shape, posture, coloration, or decorative features.

Thus, the **allowed changes list** includes:
- The **base** (replaced with a black one)
- The **background** (changed to include textured ancient motifs)
- The **enclosure** (addition of transparent box with gold trim)
- The **branding elements** (logo, magnetic closure)
- The **overall presentation context** (from museum-style display to luxury collectible packaging)

**Allowed Changes List:**
- Base material and color (original stone base → black stand)
- Surrounding environment (neutral gradient → luxurious backdrop with motifs)
- Outer casing (none → transparent box with gold accents)
- Functional elements (no closure → magnetic closure)
- Branding (no logo → modern elegant logo)
- Interior decoration (plain → patterned backdrop inspired by ancient Chinese art)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
We now identify what **must not change**, based on exclusion from the "Allowed Changes" list and core identity logic.

**Core recognition elements:**  
This horse sculpture is a **Tang Dynasty-style painted terracotta horse**, identifiable by several iconic features:
- The **raised left front leg** in mid-prance — a hallmark of Tang dynasty equestrian statuary
- The **flowing mane** and **tail draping over the flank** — characteristic of imperial horse representations
- The **saddle cloth with pleats and spherical ornaments** — historically accurate for Tang period riding gear
- The **faded red-orange pigmentation** on the saddle, bridle, and limbs — original painted details indicating authenticity
- The **proportions and facial features**: elongated head, wide eyes, flared nostrils, and upright ears — all signature traits of Tang horses
- The **hoof shapes and leg stance** — anatomically stylized yet realistic

These features are **essential for identifying the object as a historical Tang horse sculpture**. Changing them would alter the cultural and historical identity of the piece.

**Functional/logical association elements:**  
While the sculpture is being repackaged, the **functional relationship between the horse and its accessories** must be preserved:
- The **saddle remains mounted correctly** on the back
- The **mane flows naturally from the neck**
- The **tail hangs over the hindquarters**
- The **hooves are grounded appropriately** (three on the ground, one lifted)

If these relationships were disrupted (e.g., saddle misplaced, tail cut off), the sculpture would lose its structural coherence and historical accuracy.

**Non-modified element deduction:**  
All unmentioned visual attributes of the horse itself — such as:
- The **texture of the terracotta surface**
- The **distribution of paint remnants**
- The **shape of the ears and eyes**
- The **position of the bridle straps**
- The **pleat pattern of the saddle cloth**

— must be retained because they are **not specified for modification** and are essential to maintaining the original appearance.

Therefore, **only the horse sculpture's form and surface details are preserved**, while **everything surrounding it (base, background, enclosure)** can be changed.

**Preservation Targets List:**
- The **dynamic pose** of the horse with left front leg raised
- The **flowing mane** extending down the neck
- The **tail draped over the rear flank**
- The **saddle cloth with pleats and spherical ornaments**
- The **red-orange painted areas** on the saddle, bridle, and limbs
- The **facial features**: large eyes, flared nostrils, upright ears
- The **hoof positions** and **leg anatomy**
- The **overall silhouette and proportions** of the horse

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The raised left front leg is a defining posture of Tang dynasty prancing horse sculptures, distinguishing them from static or walking poses. It is a core identity feature; if removed or altered, the sculpture would no longer represent the intended dynamic motion typical of this style. Thus, preserving this specific limb position is critical for authenticity.
    Question: Is the left front leg of the horse raised off the ground?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
