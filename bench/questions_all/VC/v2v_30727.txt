Description of reference image: The subject is a zebra standing by a watering hole, with its head lowered as if drinking water. The zebra's body displays the characteristic black and white stripes that cover its entire form. Its legs are slender, and its tail hangs down naturally. The background consists of dry, brown earth and scattered rocks near the watering hole. The scene conveys a natural savanna environment.

Thinking process: First, analyze the instructions that clearly state what can be changed, such as adding a person stepping on the zebra's tail and altering the zebra's posture to appear startled. This involves changes in the zebra's expression and position but does not alter its core identity or the overall scene setting. Hidden elements include adjusting the zebra's reaction and integrating the new character logically into the scene.

Allowed Changes List:
Specific element 1 that allows for changes
- Addition of a human figure interacting with the zebra.
- Adjustment of the zebra's head position and expression to show surprise.
- Minor adjustments to the zebra's tail position due to interaction.

Step 2- Determine the elements that should remain unchanged

Thinking process:
Core recognition elements: The zebra's iconic black and white stripe pattern is crucial for identifying it as a zebra. The watering hole and surrounding rocks are key environmental features that establish the scene's context. These must remain consistent to preserve the image's identity and coherence.

Functional/logical association elements: The zebra's body structure (legs, torso) and the spatial relationship between the zebra and the watering hole must be retained to maintain logical consistency. Altering these would disrupt the scene's realism.

Non-modified element deduction: After excluding allowed changes, details like the zebra's leg positioning, the texture of its stripes, and the background rocks need to be preserved to ensure visual coherence.

Preservation Targets List:â€‹
(Element 1 that should be maintained)
- The zebra's black and white stripe pattern.
- The zebra's body structure (legs, torso).
- The presence and appearance of the watering hole.
- The surrounding rocks and dry earth background.

Q1: 
Thinking process: The zebra's stripe pattern is its most distinctive feature. Losing this would make the animal unrecognizable. Therefore, this is a core identity feature worth 3 points.
Question: Does the zebra retain its black and white stripe pattern?
Choices: yes, no
A: yes
Weight: 3

Q2: 
Thinking process: The zebra's body structure, including its legs and torso, is essential for maintaining its recognizable form. Any significant change here would affect the zebra's identity.
Question: Is the zebra's body structure, including its legs and torso, intact?
Choices: yes, no
A: yes
Weight: 2

Q3: 
Thinking process: The watering hole is a key environmental feature that sets the scene. Its presence helps maintain the image's context and coherence.
Question: Is the watering hole still present in the image?
Choices: yes, no
A: yes
Weight: 2

Q4: 
Thinking process: The surrounding rocks and dry earth provide important environmental context. Their presence supports the scene's authenticity.
Question: Are the surrounding rocks and dry earth background still visible?
Choices: yes, no
A: yes
Weight: 1

Q5: 
Thinking process: The zebra's tail is an important detail that contributes to its overall appearance. While minor adjustments are allowed, its general shape and position should remain consistent.
Question: Does the zebra's tail retain its natural shape and position?
Choices: yes, no
A: yes
Weight: 1
