      "thinking_process": "The metallic mask with its distinct animal-like shape and horned temples is a core identity element. Its unique form, especially the upward-curving horns and textured surface, distinguishes it from other masks. If lost or altered beyond recognition, the subject’s identity and symbolic intent would be compromised. This is a key identifier, hence weight 3.",
      "question": "Is the metallic mask with horn-like protrusions at the temples present and retaining its original shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The visible lower face, particularly the red lips and clear jawline, is essential for identifying the human subject. The lip color and facial contours are consistent with the original image and not mentioned for change. Their retention ensures continuity of character identity.",
      "question": "Are the red lips and visible lower face (including chin and jawline) clearly present and unchanged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The black hair styled in an updo with floral adornments is a defining feature of the subject’s appearance. While the flowers themselves may be modified, the **structure of the hairstyle** and **placement of the branches** in the hair are not specified for change. Retaining the hair’s position and volume maintains the original composition.",
      "question": "Is the black hair styled in an updo with floral branches positioned symmetrically on both sides of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The cherry blossom branches are part of the hair ornamentation. Although their size and style can be changed, their **presence in the hair** and **symmetrical placement** around the head are critical for visual balance and cultural authenticity. Removing or relocating them disrupts the original design logic.",
      "question": "Are cherry blossom branches visibly integrated into the hair on both sides of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The skin tone and facial symmetry are foundational to the subject’s realism and identity. The fair complexion and balanced facial features are not mentioned for alteration, so they must remain intact. Any deviation would affect recognition and consistency.",
      "question": "Is the subject’s facial skin tone fair and uniformly lit, matching the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The original positioning of the subject—front-facing, centered, with symmetrical framing—is crucial for composition. While the background may be altered, the subject’s orientation and posture are not mentioned for change. Preserving this ensures the edited image remains visually coherent.",
      "question": "Is the subject facing directly forward with a symmetrical pose and centered composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The texture of the mask, including its matte finish and subtle surface details, contributes to its realism and identity. Even if the style shifts, the **material impression** (metallic, textured) should remain recognizable. This detail supports the mask’s role as a symbolic object.",
      "question": "Does the mask retain a textured, metallic surface appearance rather than becoming smooth or cartoonish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
