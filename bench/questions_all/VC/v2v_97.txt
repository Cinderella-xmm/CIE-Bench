### Step 1: Description of Reference Image and Allowed Changes List

**Description of Reference Image:**  
The subject is a greenish-gray duffel bag with brown leather handles and straps, placed on a wooden floor. The bag has a sturdy structure with visible stitching and metallic hardware. A white ceramic bowl sits beside it on the same wooden floor. The background consists of a plain wall with a baseboard, contributing to a minimalistic indoor setting. The bag's earthy tones and structural design are distinct, while the bowl's simplicity contrasts with the bag's complexity.

**Thinking Process:**  
The instructions clearly state transforming the bag and bowl into anime characters while retaining their distinctive features. The scene's wooden floor and indoor setting are to be retained. The bag's earthy tones, leather straps, and structural design, along with the bowl's white color and shape, are crucial for recognition. The scene's wooden floor and minimalistic background are also essential for maintaining the setting.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
- The bag and bowl can be transformed into anime characters with cat-like attributes.
- Expressions and actions of the characters can be adjusted according to the manga panels.
- The text boxes and speech bubbles can be added with specified content.
- The overall art style can be changed to a cute Japanese anime style.

### Step 2: Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged

**Thinking Process:**  
Core recognition elements include the bag's earthy tones, leather straps, and structural design, as well as the bowl's white color and shape. Functional/logical association elements include the bag's position relative to the bowl and the wooden floor setting. Remaining elements like the bag's stitching and metallic hardware should be retained for visual coherence.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
- The bag's earthy tones and leather straps.
- The bag's structural design and stitching.
- The bowl's white color and shape.
- The wooden floor and indoor setting.
- The bag's position relative to the bowl.
