**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a young girl with short, straight black hair, standing in the center of a traditional Japanese market alleyway. She wears a richly patterned kimono featuring red as the dominant color, interwoven with blue, gold, and white motifs resembling waves, floral patterns, and geometric designs. The kimono has a wide obi tied at the back and flows to the ground with a visible hemline. Her posture is slightly turned to her right, holding a single bright red chrysanthemum-like flower in her left hand. The background consists of rows of hanging orange paper lanterns (chochin) suspended from both sides of the alley, forming a tunnel effect. Beneath the lanterns are rectangular wooden trays filled with colorful dried goods—red, pink, blue, and brown—arranged symmetrically along both sides of the path. On the right side, several people are seated behind the trays, appearing to sell goods. Vertical banners with black Japanese calligraphy hang beneath the lanterns. The lighting is warm and diffused, suggesting late afternoon or early evening. The overall composition emphasizes symmetry, depth, and cultural authenticity.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instructions specify the following transformations:  
- **Style change**: Convert the girl into "cartoon style" → implies artistic stylization but not identity alteration.  
- **Kimono modification**: "Exaggerated with flowing patterns in brighter hues" → allows for stylistic enhancement of design and color saturation, but not removal of core elements.  
- **Lanterns transformed into colorful balloons** → explicitly changes form and function; original lanterns must be replaced.  
- **Card titles in bold, traditional fonts** → adds new text elements not present in original; not a retention requirement.  
- **Detachable sections for personal messages at bottom** → introduces functional UI element not in original; not a retention concern.  

Thus, **allowed changes include**:  
- The **form and material** of the lanterns (from paper lanterns to balloons).  
- The **visual style** of the girl (to cartoonish rendering).  
- The **color intensity and pattern exaggeration** of the kimono.  
- The **addition of text and message areas** on postcards.  
- The **overall aesthetic tone** (e.g., shifting from photorealistic to illustrative).

**Allowed Changes List:**  
- Form and texture of the lanterns (paper → balloon)  
- Artistic style of the girl (realistic → cartoon)  
- Color saturation and pattern exaggeration of the kimono  
- Addition of bold text titles and detachable message sections  
- Background lighting and atmosphere adjustment for cartoon appeal

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
We now identify what **must remain unchanged**, based on exclusion from the allowed changes list and core recognition logic:

1. **Core recognition elements**:  
   - The **girl’s facial features** (especially her expression, eye shape, nose, and mouth) are essential to identifying her as the central figure. Even in cartoon style, her face must retain recognizable traits.  
   - The **kimono’s base pattern structure** (wave motifs, floral designs, color distribution) must be preserved despite exaggeration—otherwise, it loses its cultural and visual identity.  
   - The **chrysanthemum flower** she holds is a symbolic object and part of her pose; its presence and position are key to narrative coherence.  
   - The **market setting layout**—symmetrical trays, vendor stalls, and alleyway perspective—is critical to scene logic. Though lanterns may become balloons, the spatial arrangement of vendors and goods should remain consistent to maintain environmental realism.

2. **Functional/logical association elements**:  
   - The **girl’s interaction with the flower**—holding it in her left hand—must be preserved. This action defines her posture and intent.  
   - The **positioning of the girl in the center aisle**, facing slightly to the right, establishes the compositional balance. Moving her would disrupt the intended visual focus.  
   - The **relationship between the girl and the surrounding environment** (vendors behind trays, trays lining both sides) must remain logically intact—she is not floating above or detached from the scene.

3. **Non-modified element deduction**:  
   - The **texture and color of the trays** (black containers with colored contents) should be retained, even if colors are enhanced. Their role as market goods is foundational.  
   - The **Japanese calligraphy banners** must remain in place, though their content might be stylized. They contribute to cultural authenticity.  
   - The **floor tiles** (gray square paving) provide grounding and continuity in space. Their presence supports environmental consistency.

Even though the lanterns are to be replaced by balloons, the **spatial structure of the lantern rows**—their alignment, density, and placement overhead—should be preserved in form to maintain the tunnel-like visual effect. Only the **material** (paper → rubber) and **shape** (lantern → balloon) are changed, not their **function** or **position**.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
- The girl’s face and head shape (including short black bob hairstyle)  
- The kimono’s base pattern (waves, floral motifs, color scheme)  
- The red flower held in the left hand  
- The girl’s central position in the alleyway  
- The symmetrical arrangement of vendor trays on both sides  
- The gray tiled floor pattern  
- The presence and positioning of calligraphy banners  
- The overhead structure of hanging objects (even if transformed)  
- The relative positions of vendors and goods

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

Q1:  
Thinking process: The girl’s short black bob hairstyle is a defining feature of her appearance in the original image. It contributes to her youthful identity and distinguishes her from other figures. Even in cartoon style, retaining this cut ensures correct identification. Its absence or replacement with long hair or curls would fundamentally alter her identity. Thus, it is a core recognition element.  
Question: Does the edited image retain the girl’s short, straight black bob hairstyle?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The red flower held in the girl’s left hand is a key narrative and compositional element. It anchors her pose and symbolizes cultural context (possibly a festival offering). Removing it or replacing it with another object would break the visual story. Its presence is essential for continuity.  
Question: Is the red flower still held in the girl’s left hand in the edited image?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The kimono’s intricate wave and floral patterns are culturally significant and visually distinctive. While the instruction allows exaggeration and brighter hues, the underlying motif structure must remain identifiable. If these patterns are entirely abstracted or removed, the kimono loses its identity as a traditional garment.  
Question: Are the wave and floral patterns visible in the kimono’s fabric in the edited image?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The symmetrical arrangement of vendor trays along both sides of the alley is crucial to the scene’s depth and realism. Altering this layout (e.g., removing one side or changing spacing) would distort the environment. Even with cartoon styling, the structural symmetry must be preserved.  
Question: Are the vendor trays arranged symmetrically on both sides of the alley in the edited image?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The gray square-tiled floor provides spatial grounding and continuity. Its presence helps maintain the sense of a real-world market environment. Changing tile color or pattern would disrupt environmental coherence, especially when paired with exaggerated elements like balloons.  
Question: Are the floor tiles gray and arranged in a grid pattern in the edited image?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The calligraphy banners hanging beneath the lanterns contain Japanese characters and contribute to cultural authenticity. Their position and presence reinforce the setting as a traditional Japanese market. Even if stylized, they must remain visible in their original locations.  
Question: Are the vertical banners with Japanese calligraphy still present beneath the hanging objects in the edited image?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The girl’s central position in the alleyway is vital for composition. She is the focal point, and moving her off-center would disrupt visual balance. Even in cartoon form, her location must remain in the middle of the path.  
Question: Is the girl positioned centrally in the alleyway between the two rows of trays in the edited image?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q8:  
Thinking process: The overhead structure of hanging objects (originally lanterns) creates a tunnel effect. Although transformed into balloons, their linear alignment and density must be preserved to maintain spatial depth. Losing this structure would collapse the scene’s perspective.  
Question: Are there multiple hanging objects aligned in rows above the alleyway in the edited image?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q9:  
Thinking process: The vendors seated behind the trays are secondary but important for scene logic. Their presence confirms the market setting. Removing them or altering their position would make the scene feel empty or unnatural.  
Question: Are there seated figures behind the trays on both sides of the alley in the edited image?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q10:  
Thinking process: The color of the trays’ contents (red, blue, pink, etc.) contributes to visual richness and cultural symbolism. While brightness may increase, the distinct color groupings must remain to preserve the market’s character.  
Question: Are the trays filled with visibly distinct colored goods (e.g., red, blue, pink) in the edited image?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1
