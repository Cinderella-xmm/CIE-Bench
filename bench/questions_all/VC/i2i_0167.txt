Description of reference image: The subject is a shiny red apple placed centrally on a wooden surface, with a short, dried stem attached at the top. The apple has a smooth surface with visible white specks scattered over it. The lighting creates highlights and shadows across the apple, emphasizing its glossy texture. The background is softly blurred, featuring hints of greenery and a bright window on the right, lending a natural ambiance.

### Step 1 - Allowed Changes List
Thinking process: The instructions specify creating three views of the apple—front, cross-section, and top—but do not mention altering the apple's core identity features, such as its glossy red color, dried stem structure, or speckled texture. The background is not specified for retention, suggesting it may be changed. However, the overall context of an apple remains crucial.

Allowed Changes List:
Specific element 1 that allows for changes: Angle and perspective of the apple for displaying the front, cross-section, and top views.
(Specific element 2 that allows for changes): Background elements, as long as the apple remains the central subject.

### Step 2 - Preservation Targets List
Thinking process: The core recognition elements include the apple's red skin, glossy texture, speckling, and stem attachment. The scene does not require specific retention, but the apple's placement on the wooden surface supports logical continuity. 

Preservation Targets List:
(Element 1 that should be maintained): Smooth glossy red skin with white specks.
(Element 2 that should be maintained): Short dried stem structure.
(Element 3 that should be maintained): Placement on a wooden surface for logical consistency.
(Element 4 that should be maintained): The apple's overall shape and volume.
