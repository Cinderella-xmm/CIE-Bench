### Step 1 - Analyze the Modification Requirements and Allowed Changes

**Description of Reference Image:**  
The image is Vincent van Gogh's famous painting *The Starry Night*. The painting features a swirling night sky filled with stars and a crescent moon, a prominent cypress tree on the left, a small village with a church steeple in the center, and rolling hills in the background. The colors are predominantly shades of blue and yellow, with thick, expressive brushstrokes giving the painting its distinctive texture.

**Thinking Process:**  
The editing instruction specifies incorporating a squirrel into the foreground while ensuring seamless integration. This means the squirrel should fit the painting's style and not disrupt the composition. The instruction does not mention altering other elements, so the rest of the painting should remain consistent with the original.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
- The addition of a squirrel in the foreground.
- Adjustments to the squirrel's size, position, and appearance to match the painting's style.

### Step 2 - Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged

**Thinking Process:**  
Core recognition elements include the swirling starry sky, the cypress tree, the village with the church steeple, and the rolling hills. These elements define the painting and must remain intact. Functional/logical associations, such as the positioning of the village beneath the sky and the cypress tree's prominence, should also be preserved. Remaining elements like the texture and color palette contribute to the painting's identity and should be retained.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
- The swirling vortex texture in the sky.
- The prominent cypress tree on the left.
- The village with the church steeple.
- The rolling hills in the background.
- The overall color palette and brushstroke texture.
