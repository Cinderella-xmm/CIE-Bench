      "thinking_process": "The zigzagging path of the Great Wall across mountain ridges is its most iconic spatial feature, defining its identity and distinguishing it from other fortifications. If this serpentine route is lost or flattened, the structure would no longer be recognizable as the Great Wall. Therefore, preserving the winding trajectory is critical for core identification.",
      "question": "Is the Great Wall depicted as a continuous, zigzagging structure following the contours of the mountain ridges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The stone brick construction with crenellated parapets is a signature architectural detail of the Great Wall. Its texture and pattern are essential for visual authenticity. Altering this would make the structure unrecognizable as a historical Chinese fortress.",
      "question": "Are the walls constructed with visible gray stone bricks and topped with crenellated battlements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "Watchtowers are functional and symbolic elements of the Great Wall. Their presence at intervals reinforces the historical and defensive purpose of the structure. Removing them would compromise both structural accuracy and narrative context.",
      "question": "Are there watchtowers visible at regular intervals along the wall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The autumn foliage is explicitly required in the editing instruction. The presence of yellow, orange, and red leaves among green vegetation is a key seasonal detail that adds narrative charm and visual richness. Losing this would contradict the specified aesthetic.",
      "question": "Do the trees surrounding the wall display bright autumn colors, including yellow, orange, and red foliage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The large rock formation near the wall serves as a distinctive landmark and provides depth to the scene. Its position relative to the wall is visually significant and helps ground the composition. Removing it would alter the spatial realism of the setting.",
      "question": "Is there a large, rounded rock formation embedded near the right side of the wall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The group of tourists walking along the wall adds human scale and narrative context. Their presence and placement (some on stairs, others standing) contribute to the scene's liveliness and realism. Even in miniature form, their positioning must reflect the original layout.",
      "question": "Are multiple small figures visible walking along the wall, with some ascending stairs and others standing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The staircase structure is a functional element that defines how people traverse the wall. Its visibility ensures the wall remains accessible and realistic. Losing the steps would make the wall appear flat and unrealistic.",
      "question": "Are there visible stone steps leading upward along the wall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
