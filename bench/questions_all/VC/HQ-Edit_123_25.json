Its shape—resembling a branching plant with fine details—is distinct and culturally significant. If altered or removed, the character’s identity and styling would be compromised. This is a core visual feature that must be preserved regardless of stylistic enhancements like paper-cut effects. Therefore, it carries a weight of 3 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The embroidery on the back of the garment is the central artistic focus of the image. The symmetrical vine-and-leaf pattern, especially the central upward-growing motif flanked by scrolling sides, is the defining characteristic of the clothing. Any loss of this structure would undermine the visual integrity of the piece. While color may shift, the outline and layout must remain consistent. Thus, it is a key identification element with a weight of 3 points.",

Its vertical lines and green color define the natural setting and contribute to the overall mood. Even if stylized, the presence of vertical bamboo stalks behind the figure must be maintained. Removing or distorting them would break the intended environmental context. This is a major scene element with a weight of 2 points.",

It is a secondary but consistent feature that supports the overall composition. While minor styling changes might be acceptable under transformation, the basic structure of the bun and positioning of loose hair must remain.

It establishes the viewer’s perspective and relationship to the subject. Changing this angle would alter the narrative framing.
