      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "The facial features—specifically the shape of the eyes, the straight nose, and the thin lips—are iconic identifiers of Elizabeth I in historical portraiture. Altering these would fundamentally change the identity of the subject, making the portrait unrecognizable as the intended figure. This is a core identity feature, hence weight 3.",
      "question": "Is the subject's face, including the almond-shaped eyes, straight nose, and closed mouth with red lips, preserved in the same position and form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The hair color (reddish-brown) and tightly curled style are historically accurate and visually distinct. They are key markers of Elizabeth I’s appearance and cannot be changed without losing recognition. This is a core identification trait, thus weight 3.",
      "question": "Are the subject’s hair color (reddish-brown) and tightly curled, rounded hairstyle preserved exactly as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The jeweled headpiece with a central hanging pendant is a unique accessory tied to the subject’s royal status and period-specific iconography. Its removal or redesign would disrupt the historical authenticity and visual identity. It is a core functional and symbolic element, so weight 3.",
      "question": "Is the jeweled headpiece with a single dangling pendant at the center of the forehead preserved in the same location and form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The hand positioning—right hand resting on a decorative object, left hand on the lap—is a compositional and symbolic feature of royal portraiture. While the object itself may be altered, the spatial relationship and gesture must remain consistent to maintain narrative logic and visual balance. This is an important structural element, hence weight 2.",
      "question": "Is the right hand positioned on a decorative object (such as a hilt) and the left hand resting on the lap, maintaining the same relative placement and orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The skin tone (pale with rosy cheeks) is a consistent trait across known depictions of Elizabeth I and contributes to the portrait’s realism and historical accuracy. Changing it would affect the subject’s likeness and age representation. Though less critical than facial features, it is still a key detail for identity preservation, so weight 2.",
      "question": "Is the subject’s skin tone (pale with subtle rosy blush on the cheeks) preserved without significant alteration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The overall frontal orientation and upright posture are essential for maintaining the dignity and authority conveyed in the original portrait. Any shift in angle or tilt would distort the intended impression. This is a key compositional element affecting visual coherence, thus weight 2.",
      "question": "Is the subject facing directly forward with an upright, symmetrical posture, as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The proportions of the figure—head size relative to body, arm length, torso shape—are critical for maintaining anatomical plausibility and artistic fidelity. Distorting them would make the figure appear unnatural or cartoonish. This is a minor but necessary detail for visual consistency, so weight 1.",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the figure (head-to-body ratio, arm length, torso width) preserved without exaggeration or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
