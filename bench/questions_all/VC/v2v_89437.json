      "thinking_process": "The ALSC logo is a core brand identifier, featuring the stylized checkmark integrated into the blue \"ALSC\" text and the full company name below. This combination is unique to the organization and essential for brand recognition. If the logo is altered in shape, color, or text, the image loses its official identity. The presence and correct rendering of this logo are critical for maintaining authenticity and trustworthiness. Therefore, this element is assigned a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the ALSC logo present in the bottom right corner with the blue \"ALSC\" text, the integrated black checkmark, and the full name \"AUTHENTICATION LEGALIZATION SERVICES CANADA\" in black capital letters below it?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The five orange circular step markers are the primary visual indicators of the process stages. Their consistent orange color and circular shape are key to identifying each step. Changing their color or shape would disrupt the visual hierarchy and make the infographic confusing. Since the instruction allows only the addition of red tape, the base form and color of these circles must remain unchanged. This is a core structural element, hence a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Are there exactly five orange circular markers positioned along the black checkmark pathway, each containing a white icon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The white icons inside each orange circle represent specific actions (e.g., magnifying glass, running figures). These are functional symbols that convey the meaning of each step. Even though the \"We verify your Document\" icon may gain additional stamps, the original icon must still be visible and identifiable. Altering other icons would misrepresent the service offered. Thus, the presence and integrity of these icons are crucial, assigning a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the icon in the first orange circle (bottom-left) a white magnifying glass over a document?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The text labels next to each step provide essential information about the service. They are functional and must remain unaltered to preserve the message. The instruction does not mention changing any text, so all labels must be preserved exactly as in the original. Losing or altering any label would compromise the infographic's informational value. This is a key functional element, thus a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the text next to the first orange circle \"We verify your Document\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The blue dots connecting the orange circles along the pathway serve as visual connectors that reinforce the sequential nature of the steps. While the pathway itself may become tangled, the blue dots must remain to maintain the flow and continuity of the process. Their presence ensures the viewer understands the progression. This is an important structural detail, so it is assigned a weight of 2 points.",
      "question": "Are there five blue dots placed along the black checkmark pathway, one between each pair of adjacent orange circles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The title \"ALSC 5 Easy Steps\" and the subtitle \"For documents to be used in Qatar\" are essential for context and identification. They define the purpose of the infographic. The instruction does not allow modification of text, so these must remain unchanged. Their presence ensures the image is correctly understood. This is a key informational element, thus a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the title \"ALSC 5 Easy Steps\" displayed at the top in bold blue font, with the subtitle \"For documents to be used in Qatar\" directly below it in smaller blue font?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The white background provides contrast and clarity, ensuring the colorful elements stand out. Although not explicitly mentioned, the instruction does not require changing the background, so it should remain white. A changed background could distract or obscure the content. This is a minor but important environmental detail, so it is assigned a weight of 1 point.",
      "question": "Is the background of the image plain white with no patterns, textures, or colors?",
