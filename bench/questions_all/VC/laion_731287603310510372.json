      "thinking_process": "The gray flat cap is explicitly emphasized in the instruction as a core visual focus (\"emphasizing the gray cap and shirt\"). Its **shape**, **position**, and **material texture** are essential to the subject’s identity and thematic intent. If the cap is removed, replaced with another hat, or significantly distorted (e.g., flattened or reshaped), the core subject identity and thematic emphasis are lost. This makes the cap a **key identity element** with a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the gray flat cap still present on the man's head, maintaining its original shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The brown leather tag on the side of the cap is a **distinctive detail** that contributes to the authenticity and design of the cap. While small, it is visually identifiable and likely part of the product branding or style. Removing or altering it would affect the accuracy of the cap representation, especially if this is a product-focused image. It is not mentioned in the instructions as something to change, so it must be preserved. As a **minor but unique detail**, it carries moderate importance.",
      "question": "Is the small brown leather tag visible on the side of the cap near the back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The heather gray t-shirt is explicitly mentioned as a focal point (\"emphasizing the gray cap and shirt\"). Its **color** and **basic cut** (crew neck, short sleeves) are necessary to maintain continuity with the original image. Changing the shirt’s color, style, or removing it entirely would contradict the instruction’s emphasis and alter the subject’s appearance significantly. Thus, it is a **key component** of the visual identity.",
      "question": "Is the man wearing a heather gray crew-neck t-shirt?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The man’s **facial hair**—specifically the mustache and goatee—is a defining feature of his appearance. These are not mentioned in the instruction as being editable, and altering them would change his identity. They contribute to the character’s distinctiveness and are crucial for recognition. Therefore, their **presence and shape** must be preserved.",
      "question": "Does the man have a mustache and a goatee?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The **side profile pose** (facing left) is a structural element of the composition. It defines how the subject interacts with space and is essential for maintaining the original framing. Changing the angle (e.g., front-facing or three-quarter view) would fundamentally alter the image’s visual narrative and break consistency. Although not directly referenced, it is implied by the static nature of the original image and must be preserved for coherence.",
      "question": "Is the man shown in a side profile, facing to the left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The **fabric texture** of both the cap and shirt is implied by the heather gray appearance—this indicates a woven or melange material. While the instruction allows sepia tone and shadows, it does not permit changing the **material quality** of the clothing. Preserving the **texture** ensures the realism and authenticity of the attire, especially since the cap and shirt are central to the theme. Though subtle, texture affects perception of material and thus contributes to visual fidelity.",
      "question": "Are the textures of the cap and shirt consistent with a heather gray fabric (i.e., showing a mix of light and dark fibers)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The **natural fit** of the cap on the head is important for realism. If the cap appears floating, misaligned, or distorted due to added shadows or overlays, it breaks logical coherence. The instruction does not suggest repositioning or detaching the cap, so its **placement relative to the head** must remain accurate. This is a **functional relationship** that supports the integrity of the subject’s appearance.",
      "question": "Is the cap sitting naturally on the man's head, aligned with the contours of his skull?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
