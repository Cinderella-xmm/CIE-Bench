      "thinking_process": "The arabesque pose — specifically the left leg extended vertically upward while balancing on the right foot en pointe — is the defining movement of the dancer. This posture is central to the image’s identity and ballet authenticity. If this spatial configuration is lost, the dancer’s action becomes unrecognizable as a ballet pose. It is a core identity feature and thus merits the highest weight.",
      "question": "Is the dancer’s left leg extended vertically upward in a full arabesque, with the right foot en pointe?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The pointe shoes are essential to identifying the dancer as a classical ballerina. Their presence, shape (with ribbons wrapped around the ankle), and placement (on both feet) are key indicators of ballet training and performance. Even if stylized, their form must be preserved. Loss would misrepresent the subject’s role.",
      "question": "Are both feet wearing pink pointe shoes with visible ribbons wrapped around the ankles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The neat bun hairstyle is a signature look for ballet dancers, especially in formal training settings. It is a functional and symbolic element of discipline and uniformity. Its retention ensures the dancer remains identifiable within the ballet context. Though color may shift, the shape and placement must remain.",
      "question": "Is the dancer’s hair styled into a tight, round bun at the top of her head?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The pale pink leotard and white tights are standard ballet attire and contribute to the dancer’s identity. While the instruction allows color modification (e.g., pastel tones), the **form** of the outfit — sleeveless leotard with tights — must remain to maintain coherence with the original subject. Changing it to something like shorts or a dress would break identity.",
      "question": "Does the dancer wear a sleeveless, fitted pink leotard paired with white tights?",

      "thinking_process": "The arm positioning — one hand gripping the barre, the other extended sideways — defines the balance and elegance of the pose. This alignment is critical to the composition and function of the movement. Even in sticker form, the spatial relationship between arms must reflect the original gesture.",
      "question": "Is one arm extended forward and slightly out to the side, while the other grips the barre?",

      "thinking_process": "The side profile orientation of the dancer — facing toward the right side of the frame — is a key compositional element that establishes depth and direction. Reversing or altering this orientation would change the narrative and visual flow of the pose. It supports the logical structure of the scene.",
      "question": "Is the dancer facing to the right side of the image, with her body in a side profile view?",

      "thinking_process": "The visible seam along the back of the leotard (common in dancewear) is a minor detail but contributes to the realism and specificity of the costume. While not critical to identity, its absence could make the garment appear generic or improperly rendered. It supports visual coherence.",
      "question": "Is there a visible seam running down the center back of the leotard?",
