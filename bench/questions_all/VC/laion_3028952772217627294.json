      "thinking_process": "The green color of the cactus is its primary identity feature, distinguishing it from other plant types and making it instantly recognizable as the central character. Changing this color would fundamentally alter its identity and break continuity with the original design. As the base color of the figure, it is a core visual anchor.",

      "thinking_process": "The sombrero with its specific stripe pattern (purple, pink, light blue, orange) is an iconic accessory defining the cactus's cultural and stylistic identity. Its absence or alteration would remove a key visual signature. The pattern is not generic but distinct, so retention is critical for recognition.",
      "question": "Does the cactus wear a sombrero with horizontal stripes in purple, pink, light blue, and orange?",

      "thinking_process": "The red pom-pom arms are a distinctive feature indicating the cactus's playful, anthropomorphic nature. They are functional extensions of the character’s expression and are visually prominent. Their removal would reduce expressiveness and alter the character’s personality.",
      "question": "Are there two red pom-poms attached to the cactus's arms?",

      "thinking_process": "The donkey’s striped saddle pattern (orange, pink, purple, teal) is a key design element that gives it visual vibrancy and cultural flair. It is not random but follows a consistent sequence. Altering the colors or pattern would disrupt its identity and thematic cohesion.",
      "question": "Does the donkey have vertical stripes in orange, pink, purple, and teal along its back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The black hooves are a defining anatomical feature of the donkey, contrasting with its gray body and reinforcing its realistic animal form. Their absence would make the legs appear incomplete or unnatural, affecting structural integrity.",
      "question": "Do the donkey’s feet end in black hooves?",

      "thinking_process": "The white muzzle is a crucial facial feature that separates the donkey’s face from its body and provides contrast for facial details. Without it, the donkey would lose its characteristic expression and appear less expressive.",
      "question": "Is the donkey’s muzzle white?",

      "question_id": "Q8",
      "thinking_process": "The black mane and tail are essential for defining the donkey’s species-specific appearance. They provide contrast and contribute to the animal’s silhouette and movement cues. Their removal would make the donkey look unnatural or incomplete.",
