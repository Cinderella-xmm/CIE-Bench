      "thinking_process": "The \"POLICE\" and \"CME\" text on the driver’s side door is a core identification feature, directly indicating the vehicle's purpose and department. Its absence or replacement would make the vehicle unrecognizable as a police car associated with the CME unit. This text is clearly visible and legible in the original image, and since the instruction does not specify altering it, it must be retained exactly as shown, even in LEGO form. Thus, preserving the text is essential for identity recognition.",
      "question": "Is the \"POLICE\" and \"CME\" text present on the driver’s side door in the same position and font style?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The gold badge emblem with the shield and star is a distinctive insignia that identifies the police department. Its unique shape and placement on the door are key visual markers that differentiate this vehicle from others. Since the instruction calls for a \"detailed LEGO model,\" the emblem must be replicated accurately in form and position to maintain authenticity. Loss of this element would severely impair recognition.",
      "question": "Is the gold-colored badge emblem with a shield and star design located on the driver’s side door?",

      "thinking_process": "The emergency light bar on the roof has a specific red-blue-red-blue alternating pattern, which is standard for police vehicles and crucial for identifying its function. The instruction specifies using red and blue translucent LEGO pieces, so the pattern must be preserved. Any deviation in sequence or color would misrepresent the vehicle’s operational identity.",
      "question": "Does the rooftop light bar have the exact red-blue-red-blue color sequence from left to right?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The front grille with horizontal slats and a central chrome bar is a defining structural feature of the car’s design. It contributes to the vehicle’s iconic look and is not mentioned as changeable. In the LEGO version, this grille must be constructed to match the original’s shape and layout to preserve the car’s identity.",
      "question": "Is the front grille composed of horizontal slats with a central chrome bar?",

      "thinking_process": "The license plate with \"LIP\" above \"CHICAGO POLICE\" is a functional identifier that links the vehicle to a specific jurisdiction. Although the instruction allows material changes, it does not permit altering the text. Retaining this text ensures the vehicle remains identifiable as belonging to the Chicago Police Department.",
      "question": "Is the license plate displaying \"LIP\" above \"CHICAGO POLICE\"?",

      "thinking_process": "The overall silhouette of the four-door sedan with a long hood and trunk is essential for recognizing the vehicle type. Even in LEGO form, the proportions and shape must remain consistent to maintain the car’s identity. Altering this would make it unrecognizable as a classic police cruiser.",
      "question": "Does the car maintain the four-door sedan silhouette with a long hood and trunk?",

      "thinking_process": "The headlights and turn signals are positioned symmetrically and are integral to the car’s front-end design. Their placement and shape contribute to the vehicle’s recognizable profile. Since the instruction requires a detailed LEGO model, these elements must be accurately replicated in position and form.",
      "question": "Are the rectangular headlights and amber turn signals positioned symmetrically on the front fenders?",
