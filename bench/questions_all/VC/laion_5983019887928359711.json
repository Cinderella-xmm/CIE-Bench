Its elaborate curl pattern and placement around the ears and back of the head are essential for identifying the subject’s historical and social context. Even if exaggerated in a cartoon style, the **presence of curls and powdered white hair** must remain. Losing this would make the character unrecognizable as a figure from that era.

Even in a 3D cartoon style, the **color (red) and presence of gold decorative motifs** must be preserved to maintain historical accuracy.

Its **shape and position at the neck** are essential for maintaining period accuracy. Even if stylized, the **presence of lace and ruffles** must be retained. Removing or simplifying it would diminish historical fidelity. This is an important detail supporting identity, so weight 2.",

Although the instruction allows for a \"muted, gradient background,\" this matches the original. Any drastic change (e.g., bright colors or patterns) would disrupt visual harmony and context. The **gradual transition from dark to light** is a subtle but important environmental element. This is a secondary detail but affects coherence, so weight 1.",
