Description of reference image: The image features three sheep in a snowy outdoor setting, positioned near a green metal fence. One adult sheep stands behind two younger ones, appearing to nuzzle or interact with them. The sheep exhibit natural woolly textures with earthy tones ranging from beige to light brown. The background consists of a snow-covered ground, bare leafless trees, and simple wooden fences, contributing to a serene winter atmosphere.

Thinking process:  
Analyzing the instructions, I understand that the sheep's forms will be transformed into chibi-style sticker characters with cartoonish features. However, the relative positions of the sheep, including the interaction between them, must remain consistent. The snowy environment and fence context are to be removed, implying no need to retain specific background details. However, the essential interaction between the sheep remains a focal point.

### Allowed Changes List:
1. Changing the sheep into chibi-style cartoon characters.
2. Adding unique accessories like a red scarf, knit hat, and small bell.
3. Applying thick white outlines and flat colors in a cartoon line-art style.
4. Removing the background and setting a transparent background for sticker use.

### Preservation Targets List:  
Element 1 that should be maintained: The relative positioning of the three sheep near the fence.  
Element 2 that should be maintained: The interaction between the adult sheep and the two younger ones.  
Element 3 that should be maintained: The distinct features of the sheep such as their general body proportions and woolly texture (in chibi form).  
Element 4 that should be maintained: The sheep's natural postures and stances.
