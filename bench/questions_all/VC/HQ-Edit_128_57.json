      "thinking_process": "The lion’s head medallion is a core decorative feature of the desk, serving as a distinctive iconographic element that identifies the ornate craftsmanship. Its presence and position at the center of the desk’s front panel are essential to maintaining the desk’s identity. Removing or altering its form would result in a loss of the original design’s signature detail, making it unrecognizable as the same piece. Therefore, this is a key identity element with a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the lion’s head medallion present at the center of the desk's front panel?",

      "thinking_process": "The quill’s feather shape is critical to its identity as a writing instrument. Even when transformed into a logo, the silhouette must retain the curved, tapering form of a real quill to preserve symbolic meaning. Losing this shape would break the connection to the original object and undermine the theme of vintage stationery. Thus, it is a core identification feature with a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Does the quill maintain its feather shape, even if stylized?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The open book with visible aged pages is the central object on the desk and represents the act of writing. Its transformation into a writing pad requires that the form remains open and shows textured, yellowed paper. This ensures continuity in function and visual storytelling. Without this, the edited image fails to convey the intended theme of writing. Hence, it is a key functional element with a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the book depicted as open, showing two pages of aged, yellowed paper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The dark wood texture of the desk is fundamental to its vintage aesthetic and distinguishes it from other materials. Even if the desk becomes a box, retaining the wood grain and dark finish ensures visual coherence with the original. Changing this would alter the material identity and disrupt the mood. This is an important scene-related element with a weight of 2 points.",
      "question": "Does the desk retain its dark wood texture and finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The arched window with leaded glass panes is a defining architectural feature of the scene, contributing to the sense of grandeur and natural lighting. Its preservation supports the continuity of setting and atmosphere, even if the background is reimagined. While not the central object, it is a key environmental element that enhances authenticity. Thus, it deserves a weight of 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the arched window with a grid of leaded glass panes visible behind the desk?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The presence of bookshelves filled with uniformly bound books establishes the library setting and reinforces the scholarly theme. Their inclusion, even in a stylized version, helps anchor the scene in its original context. While the specific books may not matter, the arrangement and appearance of the shelves are important for visual consistency. This is a secondary but meaningful detail with a weight of 1 point.",
      "question": "Are tall bookshelves with rows of leather-bound books visible to the left of the desk?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The color palette—particularly the contrast between dark wood, cream-colored pages, and deep red/blue rug—defines the mood and period style. Preserving these colors ensures the edited image retains the original’s elegant, vintage feel. While tones might be adjusted slightly, major deviations would compromise visual harmony. This is a minor but coherent detail with a weight of 1 point.",
      "question": "Are the dominant colors dark brown, cream, and deep red/blue consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
