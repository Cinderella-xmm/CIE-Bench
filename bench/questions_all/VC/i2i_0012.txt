Description of reference image: The subject is a half-length portrait of a woman with long straight dark hair parted in the middle. Her expression is serene with subtle smile, and she wears a dark, loose garment with a golden-brown trim around the neckline. Her arms are crossed in front of her at the waist. The background depicts a mystical landscape with winding rivers, distant mountains, and atmospheric depth using warm and muted earth tones.

### Step 1 - Allowed Changes List
Thinking process: The editing instructions specify redrawing the image in Studio Ghibli style. This implies that the artistic style, such as color palette, brushwork, and overall aesthetic, can be altered to align with Studio Ghibliâ€™s animation style. However, any modifications should maintain the essential identity of the subject and the scene.

Allowed Changes List:
1. Artistic style and texture (e.g., switching from realistic oil painting to animated cell shading).
2. Color palette adjustment to fit the vibrant and dynamic hues characteristic of Studio Ghibli films.
3. Brushwork details to match the typical line art and shading techniques in animation.
4. Slight alterations in the background landscape while maintaining the overall structure.

### Step 2 - Preservation Targets List
Thinking process: Considering the core recognition elements for this well-known artwork, it is crucial to retain the iconic features that define it. The functional/logical associations, such as the subject's pose and attire, must also remain intact to preserve the context.

Preservation Targets List:
1. The subject's facial features and expression.
2. The subject's attire, including the neckline design and arm positioning.
3. The overall composition of the subject centered in the frame.
4. The core background elements like the river and mountains, ensuring they remain recognizable.
