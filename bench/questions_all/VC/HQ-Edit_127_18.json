      "thinking_process": "The curved shape and size of the tusks are the most distinctive features of this African elephant. They are key to species identification and must remain intact even in miniature form. If the tusks are shortened, straightened, or absent, the animal would no longer be recognizable as the same individual or species. This is a core identity feature, making it a 3-point question.",
      "question": "Are the elephant's tusks present and curved outward in a natural arc, extending from the mouth and tapering toward the tips?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The skin texture with deep wrinkles is a defining physical trait of elephants, particularly African elephants. It contributes to both species recognition and realistic depiction. Even in a diorama, this texture must be replicated to maintain authenticity. Loss of these folds would make the model appear artificial or incorrect. This is a core visual feature, thus weighted at 3 points.",
      "question": "Does the elephant's skin display deep, wrinkled folds across the forehead, neck, and body, consistent with natural elephant dermatology?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The acacia tree’s flat, umbrella-like canopy is iconic in African savannas and serves as a landmark in the image. Its unique branching structure and horizontal spread are essential for scene recognition. Removing or altering it would disrupt the environmental context. While scaled down, its shape must remain accurate. This is a critical scene element, hence 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the acacia tree present with a broad, flat canopy and extended horizontal branches above the elephant?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The golden grass field is a key component of the savannah setting. Its height, color, and directional flow contribute to the sense of place. Even if made of resin, the grass must resemble the original in color (golden-yellow) and density. This supports environmental coherence and is important enough to be a 2-point element.",
      "question": "Is the foreground covered in tall, golden-yellow grass blades that extend upward and show subtle motion from wind?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The distant snow-capped mountains provide geographic depth and contrast to the warm tones of the savannah. Their presence and basic shape (peaked, layered, blue-gray) are essential for maintaining the original landscape’s character. Though possibly simplified in a diorama, their silhouette must remain. This is a major scene element, thus 2 points.",
      "question": "Are snow-capped mountains visible in the background, forming a distant ridge line behind the elephant?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The elephant’s trunk is a functional and identifying feature. Its curled tip and segmented appearance are crucial for realism. Even in miniature, the curl and texture must be preserved. This is a key anatomical detail that defines the animal’s behavior and identity, so it earns 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the elephant's trunk curled at the tip and showing segmented ridges along its length?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The large ears of the African elephant are a distinguishing trait compared to Asian elephants. Their size, shape, and flaps are essential for correct species identification. Even in a model, they must retain their broad, fan-like form. This is a core recognition feature, warranting 3 points.",
      "question": "Do the elephant's ears have a large, broad, fan-shaped outline with visible internal folds and a downward flare?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "thinking_process": "The lighting direction affects shadows and highlights, contributing to depth and realism. The original image shows sunlight coming from the upper left, casting shadows to the lower right. This must be preserved in the diorama to maintain visual consistency. While lighting may be simulated, its direction must remain unchanged. This is a logical coherence element, so 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the lighting consistent with a source from the upper left, casting shadows on the right side of the elephant and grass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
