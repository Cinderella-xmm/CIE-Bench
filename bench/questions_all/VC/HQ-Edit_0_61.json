      "thinking_process": "The shoji screen with its precise grid of wooden frames and translucent paper panels is a core architectural feature of traditional Japanese interiors and is essential for identifying the cultural context of the scene. Its removal or alteration would fundamentally change the setting from a Japanese tea room to something generic. Since the instruction does not allow changes to the background structure, this element must be preserved.",
      "question": "Is the shoji screen window with its grid of wooden frames and translucent paper panels present and unchanged?",

      "thinking_process": "The tatami mat flooring with its distinct woven texture and green border lines is a defining element of the room’s authenticity. It provides both functional and aesthetic grounding for the scene. Any replacement or abstraction of this flooring would break the connection to traditional Japanese domestic spaces, which is critical for the image’s identity.",
      "question": "Are the tatami mats with their woven texture and green border lines visible and unaltered?",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The scattered maple leaves on the floor in red, orange, and yellow hues are key indicators of the autumn season and contribute directly to the theme of the image. Their presence is central to the visual narrative of fall and must be retained to preserve the seasonal atmosphere, even if the specific arrangement is slightly adjusted.",
      "question": "Are maple leaves in autumnal colors (red, orange, yellow) visibly scattered across the tatami floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The potted maple tree with its vibrant fall foliage on the right side of the frame is a prominent compositional element that anchors the scene in nature and enhances the autumn theme. Its presence is crucial for maintaining the balance and depth of the image. Removing or altering it would disrupt the visual harmony and seasonal message.",
      "question": "Is the potted maple tree with bright red and yellow leaves visible in the upper right corner of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The soft golden light filtering through the shoji screen is a critical atmospheric element that defines the mood of serenity and warmth. It creates visible gradients and highlights on the tea set and floor, contributing to the image’s emotional resonance. Preserving this lighting ensures the original ambiance remains intact despite other modifications.",
      "question": "Is the warm, diffused golden light coming through the shoji screen visible, creating soft shadows and highlights on the objects and floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The spatial layout — with the tea tray positioned in front of the shoji screen and aligned with the view of the autumn forest — establishes the logical relationship between indoor ritual and outdoor nature. This positioning is essential for the narrative of harmony between human activity and the environment, a core principle in tea culture. Any significant shift in this layout would undermine the scene’s coherence.",
      "question": "Is the tea tray placed centrally in front of the shoji screen, facing the autumnal view outside?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The background view through the shoji screen shows a forest in autumn colors, reinforcing the seasonal theme. While not as detailed as the foreground, this distant scenery contributes to the depth and context of the scene. Its preservation ensures continuity with the autumn motif and maintains the illusion of a real-world environment beyond the room.",
      "question": "Is a blurred autumn forest with red and orange trees visible through the shoji screen in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
