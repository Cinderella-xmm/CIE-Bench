**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

Description of reference image:  
The subject is a woman with elaborate *Day of the Dead* (Día de Muertos) face paint, featuring a white base with black stitching lines around the mouth and cheeks, pink blush on the cheeks, and floral patterns in red and purple surrounding the eyes. Her eyes are accentuated with long false lashes and dark purple eyeshadow. The forehead has a blue spiderweb design with golden dots. Her hair is styled in braids interwoven with orange and yellow ribbons, and she wears a large, vibrant floral headdress composed of layered orange and yellow fabric flowers with green leaves. She also wears ornate gold filigree earrings that dangle from her ears. The background is blurred but appears to be an outdoor setting with teal-colored elements.

Thinking process:  
The editing instructions specify transforming the **floral headdress** into a **chibi-style headpiece accessory**, emphasizing the **large orange and yellow flowers** while integrating the **braided hair design** into the accessory. This implies that the **form and structure** of the headdress can change—specifically, it becomes stylized and cartoonish—but the **color palette (orange and yellow)** and **presence of floral elements** must remain consistent. The instruction says to **integrate the intricate braided hair design into the accessory**, meaning the **braid pattern** (black, orange, yellow) must be preserved within the new form, not removed. Additionally, the **earrings** are to be converted into **miniature golden chibi-style charms attached to the headpiece**, so their **material (gold), intricate patterns, and function (as accessories)** are retained but repositioned and resized. The **background** is not mentioned, so it may be altered or kept as-is. However, since no explicit changes to facial makeup or expression are stated, those should remain unchanged.

Allowed Changes List:  
- The **form and structure** of the floral headdress (can become chibi-style)  
- The **placement and size** of the earrings (reduced to miniature charms, moved to headpiece)  
- The **overall shape and proportion** of the headpiece (stylized into chibi format)  
- The **background** (not specified for retention, so allowed to change)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements: The **face paint design** is iconic to *Día de Muertos* celebrations and includes specific symbolic features such as the **white base**, **black stitched mouth**, **red floral eye frames**, **purple eyeshadow**, **blue spiderweb forehead**, and **pink cheek blush**. These are essential to identifying the cultural context and artistic intent of the image. Any alteration to these would fundamentally change the identity of the subject’s appearance. Therefore, these **must be preserved**.  

Functional/logical association elements: The **connection between the earrings and the headpiece** is now redefined by the instruction—they are to be **attached to the headpiece**, but their **golden color and intricate lace-like pattern** must still be present. Their **functional role as jewelry** remains, even if repositioned. Thus, the **visual identity of the earrings** must be preserved, though not their original position.  

Non-modified element deduction: After excluding the allowed changes (headdress form, earring placement), the remaining **facial features**, **makeup details**, **hair braid colors**, **flower colors**, and **earring texture** must be retained. Even though the headdress is transformed, the **colors and types of flowers** (orange and yellow) and the **braid pattern (black, orange, yellow)** are explicitly referenced for integration, meaning they are **not being replaced** but **repurposed**—so their **visual attributes must remain accurate**.  

Preservation Targets List:  
- The **white face paint base**  
- The **black stitched mouth and cheek lines**  
- The **red floral patterns around the eyes**  
- The **purple eyeshadow and long false lashes**  
- The **blue spiderweb design on the forehead**  
- The **pink blush on the cheeks**  
- The **orange and yellow fabric flowers** in the headdress  
- The **black, orange, and yellow braided hair pattern**  
- The **golden filigree texture of the earrings**  
- The **presence of green leaves** in the floral arrangement

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

Q1:  
Thinking process: The **white face paint base** is the foundational element of the *calavera* (sugar skull) makeup, distinguishing it from other styles. Without this white base, the entire cultural identity of the makeup is lost. It is a core recognition feature and cannot be changed without destroying the subject's identity.  
Question: Is the white base of the face paint present?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The **black stitched mouth and cheek lines** are iconic symbols of the *Día de Muertos* aesthetic, representing a stylized skull. These lines are distinct and essential to the visual identity of the makeup. Removing them would make the face appear less like a traditional calavera.  
Question: Are the black stitched lines around the mouth and cheeks present?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The **red floral patterns surrounding the eyes** are key decorative elements that frame the eyes and are part of the traditional design. They are visually prominent and help identify the makeup style. Their presence is required for authenticity.  
Question: Are the red floral designs around the eyes present?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The **purple eyeshadow and long false lashes** are critical components of the dramatic eye makeup. While some color variation might be acceptable, the **combination of deep purple and exaggerated lashes** is a signature detail. Changing this would alter the intended look.  
Question: Are the purple eyeshadow and long false lashes visible around the eyes?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The **blue spiderweb design on the forehead** is a unique and recognizable feature that adds symbolic depth (often representing the web of life or death). Its presence is not common in all calavera designs, making it a distinctive identifier.  
Question: Is the blue spiderweb pattern with golden dots on the forehead present?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The **orange and yellow fabric flowers** in the headdress are central to the visual composition and cultural symbolism. Although the headdress form may change, the **colors and type of flowers** must remain because they are explicitly emphasized in the instruction.  
Question: Are the orange and yellow fabric flowers present in the headdress?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The **black, orange, and yellow braided hair pattern** is specifically mentioned for integration into the new headpiece. This means the **color sequence and braid structure** must be preserved, even if stylized. Losing this would break continuity with the original.  
Question: Are the black, orange, and yellow braids visible in the hair?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q8:  
Thinking process: The **golden filigree texture of the earrings** is a key detail that contributes to the ornate aesthetic. Even though they are to be miniaturized and attached to the headpiece, their **intricate pattern and golden color** must be retained to maintain visual coherence.  
Question: Do the earrings retain the golden filigree pattern?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q9:  
Thinking process: The **green leaves** accompanying the flowers in the headdress are minor but important for realism and natural balance. They provide contrast and depth to the floral arrangement. While not central, their absence would reduce visual fidelity.  
Question: Are green leaves visible among the flowers in the headdress?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q10:  
Thinking process: The **pink blush on the cheeks** is a subtle but significant detail that softens the skull-like appearance and adds femininity. It is a consistent feature in many calavera designs and contributes to the overall balance of the makeup.  
Question: Is the pink blush visible on the cheeks?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1
