      "thinking_process": "The orange fur with white underbelly and black legs is the core identity feature of the red fox. Changing these colors or patterns would result in misidentification of the animal species. The distribution of fur color is unique to red foxes and is essential for recognition. Therefore, this element is critical and assigned 3 points.",
      "question": "Does the fox retain its characteristic orange fur on the back and sides, white fur on the chest and muzzle, and black fur on the lower legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The bushy tail with a distinct white tip is a defining morphological trait of the red fox. It is highly recognizable and separates it from other similar canids. Losing this feature would compromise species identification, even in a cartoon form. Hence, it is a core identifier and worth 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the fox’s tail bushy and curled, ending in a clearly visible white tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The two monarch butterflies are present in the original image and are visually distinct due to their orange and black wing patterns. They contribute to the naturalistic setting and are not mentioned for removal in the instructions. Their presence supports ecological realism and visual balance. Although they may be stylized, their existence must be preserved to maintain consistency with the original scene.",
      "question": "Are there two monarch butterflies with orange and black wings hovering near the fox’s head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The small white daisies in the foreground provide environmental context and detail. They are not central to the narrative but enhance the forest setting. Since they are not mentioned for deletion or modification, retaining them ensures visual coherence with the original image. Their absence would create a noticeable gap in the scene.",
      "question": "Are there small white daisies with yellow centers growing in the mossy foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The moss-covered ground is a key environmental texture in the original image, contributing to the forest ambiance. While the color palette may shift to pastels, the **presence of moss** and its **textured appearance** must remain to preserve the natural setting. Removing it would alter the fundamental terrain of the scene.",
      "question": "Is the ground covered in green moss with visible texture, especially beneath and around the fox?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The backlighting effect created by sunlight filtering through the trees is a major atmospheric element in the original image. It defines the time of day and mood. While the lighting may be stylized, the **directional glow from behind the trees** must be preserved to maintain the sense of depth and natural lighting. This is a crucial environmental cue.",
      "question": "Is there a bright light source behind the trees, creating a glowing effect and casting rays through the forest canopy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
