Description of reference image: The subject is a large African elephant standing on a flat, sandy desert terrain under a clear blue sky with scattered white clouds. The elephant faces slightly to the right, with its trunk hanging down and curving gently toward the ground. Its skin is textured with deep wrinkles and folds, particularly prominent on the legs, ears, and trunk, and has a uniform light brown or tan coloration consistent with a dusty environment. The ears are large and fan-shaped, extending outward from the head, with visible veins and natural creases. The tusks are long, curved, and off-white in color, emerging from the upper jaw and pointing downward. The eyes are small, dark, and positioned near the side of the head. The feet are broad and columnar, each with five visible toes. To the right of the elephant, there is a red backpack placed upright on the sand. The backpack is made of smooth fabric, with a main compartment, a front zippered pocket, two shoulder straps, and a top handle. It features a rich, saturated red hue that contrasts sharply with the earthy tones of the elephant and background. The background consists of a vast open desert landscape with low-lying shrubs and distant horizon line, under a pale blue sky with soft cloud formations.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions to determine what can be changed. The instruction explicitly states that the original scene should be transformed into a LEGO-style minifigure and elephant figure encased in a glass cube with a museum-like display base. This indicates that the **form** of the subjects (elephant and backpack) will be reimagined as stylized figures, and the **scene** will be replaced entirely with a new interior setting. However, the instruction specifies that the **elephant's palette derives from the earthy hues of the original image**, and the **backpack’s rich red tone is mirrored**—this implies that the **color scheme** of the original elements must be preserved in the new design. Additionally, the **biological classification information** and **nameplate text** are derived from the original subject (African Elephant), so the identity of the animal must remain intact. The instruction does not mention changing the **tusk shape**, **ear structure**, or **skin texture** of the elephant, nor does it allow for altering the **red color** of the backpack. Therefore, while the **form** and **context** are allowed to change, the **core visual identity features** of the elephant and the **distinctive color** of the backpack must be retained.

Allowed Changes List:
- The form of the elephant (to become a LEGO-style minifigure)
- The form of the backpack (to become a stylized figure)
- The overall scene (desert landscape replaced with a glass cube and museum base)
- The scale and proportion of the subjects (adjusted for miniature display)
- The lighting and atmosphere (modified to suit a polished collectible aesthetic)
- The position and orientation of the subjects (rearranged within the glass cube)

Step 2 - Determine the elements that should remain unchanged

Thinking process:
Core recognition elements: The African elephant is identifiable by its **large ears**, **long trunk**, **curved tusks**, **wrinkled skin**, and **five-toed feet**. These are essential morphological traits that distinguish it from other elephants (e.g., Asian elephants have smaller ears). The **rich red color of the backpack** is a key visual contrast in the original image and is explicitly referenced in the instruction as a source for accent color in the new design. Thus, the **color** of the backpack must be preserved even if its form changes. The **identity of the animal as an African elephant** must be maintained through these core anatomical features.

Functional/logical association elements: The **presence of the backpack next to the elephant** establishes a juxtaposition between nature and human-made object. While the instruction allows transformation of both objects, it does not suggest removing their relationship. Since the backpack’s red color is used to inform the design of the new scene, its **existence and color** are functionally tied to the aesthetic direction of the edit. Therefore, the **color and presence** of the backpack must be preserved in some form.

Non modified element deduction: After excluding allowed changes (form, scene, scale), the remaining unmentioned but visually present elements include the **texture of the elephant’s skin**, the **shape of the tusks**, the **structure of the ears**, the **number of toes**, and the **specific shade of red** of the backpack. These are not mentioned as changeable and are critical to maintaining the original subject’s identity and visual coherence. Even though the form becomes stylized, the **core visual characteristics** must be reflected in the new design.

Preservation Targets List:
- The large, fan-shaped ears of the African elephant
- The long, curved tusks of the elephant
- The wrinkled, textured skin of the elephant
- The five-toed feet of the elephant
- The rich red color of the backpack
- The identity of the animal as an African elephant (implied by morphology)
- The presence of the backpack as a distinct object adjacent to the elephant

Q1:  
Thinking process: The large, fan-shaped ears are a defining anatomical feature of African elephants, distinguishing them from Asian elephants. Their size, shape, and positioning are critical for species identification. In the edited image, even if stylized, the ears must retain their broad, outward-facing form to maintain the correct species identity. Losing this feature would result in misidentification, making it a core recognition element. Therefore, the question directly targets the presence and shape of the ears, which must be preserved.
Question: Does the elephant in the edited image retain large, fan-shaped ears that extend outward from the head?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The long, curved tusks are another key identifier of African elephants. They are not only functional but also iconic in visual representation. The instruction does not permit removal or alteration of this feature, as it is part of the elephant’s biological identity. Even in a LEGO-style design, the tusk shape must be preserved to ensure accurate species representation. This is a core identity feature, hence weighted at 3 points.
Question: Are the elephant’s tusks long, curved, and off-white in color, extending downward from the upper jaw?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The wrinkled, textured skin is a distinctive trait of elephants, especially evident in the original image. This texture contributes to the animal’s realism and helps differentiate it from smoother animals. Although the style may change, the instruction implies retention of the earthy hue and likely the tactile quality. The texture is a secondary but important detail that supports visual authenticity and continuity. Its loss would reduce fidelity to the original.
Question: Is the elephant’s skin depicted with deep wrinkles and folds, particularly on the trunk, legs, and ears?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The five-toed feet are a specific anatomical detail that distinguishes elephants and adds to their realistic portrayal. While the form may be simplified in a LEGO model, the number of toes should still be represented to preserve biological accuracy. This is a minor but informative detail that supports the integrity of the subject’s identity.
Question: Do the elephant’s feet show five distinct toes on each foot?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The rich red color of the backpack is explicitly referenced in the instruction as a source for accent color in the new design. This means the color must be preserved, even if the backpack’s form changes. The red hue is a key visual anchor in the original image and serves as a stylistic bridge to the new scene. Its absence would break the intended color logic.
Question: Is the backpack rendered in a rich, saturated red color matching the original image?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The presence of the backpack next to the elephant establishes a visual relationship that is central to the original composition. Although the instruction allows transformation, it does not remove the backpack. The instruction uses its color to inform the design, implying its continued relevance. Therefore, the backpack must remain as a distinct object in proximity to the elephant.
Question: Is the backpack present as a separate object positioned near the elephant in the edited image?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The identity of the animal as an African elephant is implied by its morphology. The combination of large ears, tusks, and body shape confirms this. The instruction refers to "African Elephant" in the nameplate, confirming that the species must be preserved. Any deviation in form must still reflect this identity. This is a core logical requirement.
Question: Is the animal clearly identifiable as an African elephant based on its ear size, tusk shape, and overall body structure?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3
