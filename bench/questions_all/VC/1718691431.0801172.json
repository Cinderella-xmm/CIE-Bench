      "thinking_process": "The fox mask is the central cultural identifier in this image. Its defining feature is the pair of upright, pointed ears with black tips and inner pinkish-red patterns. These ears are unique to the kitsune motif and distinguish it from other animal masks. Losing their shape or position would fundamentally alter the identity of the subject. Therefore, the presence and shape of the ears are core recognition elements, warranting a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Are the two upright, pointed ears with black outer edges and pinkish-red inner patterns present on the mask?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The visibility of the human eyes through the mask cutouts confirms that this is a person wearing a mask, not a static sculpture. This functional detail maintains the subject’s identity as a living wearer and is critical to understanding the context. Removing or obscuring the eyes would misrepresent the original intent. Thus, eye visibility is a key functional element, assigned 3 points.",
      "question": "Are the human eyes clearly visible through the eye openings in the mask?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The kimono’s V-neck collar and layered sleeve structure define its traditional form. Even when stylized, the silhouette must retain these architectural features to be recognized as a kimono. Altering the neckline or sleeve shape would transform it into another garment type. This is a core structural element, hence 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the kimono structured with a V-shaped neckline and wide sleeves extending from the shoulders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The obi is a defining accessory of the kimono ensemble. Its placement across the chest and width are characteristic of formal wear. While color and pattern may change, its position and general shape must remain to preserve the garment’s identity. This is an important accessory element, thus 2 points.",
      "question": "Is there a wide sash (obi) positioned horizontally across the chest, aligned with the center of the kimono?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The whiskers are distinctive features of the fox mask, arranged in three parallel lines on each side, alternating black and white. Their presence and configuration are part of the mask’s symbolic design. Removing or altering them would diminish the authenticity of the kitsune representation. This is a key detail element, assigned 2 points.",
      "question": "Are there three distinct whiskers on each side of the mask, alternating in black and white?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The mask’s nose and mouth are centrally located and have defined shapes—a small black nose and a subtly curved mouth line. These facial features anchor the mask’s expression and alignment. Changing their position or shape would distort the mask’s identity. Though less prominent than ears or eyes, they are necessary for accurate representation, thus 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the nose positioned centrally below the eyes and shaped as a small black oval, with a faint mouth line beneath it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The bilateral symmetry of the composition—mask, eyes, ears, obi, and kimono—is essential for visual balance and cultural aesthetic. The original image is perfectly symmetrical, and the instruction emphasizes elegance and harmony. Disrupting symmetry would violate both the original and desired artistic intent. This is a secondary but significant compositional element, assigned 1 point.",
      "question": "Is the overall composition symmetrically balanced along the vertical axis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
