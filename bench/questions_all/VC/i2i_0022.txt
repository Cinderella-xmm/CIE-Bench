Description of reference image: The subject is a fluffy cat curled up on the hood of a gray car. The cat has a tabby coat with visible stripes and patterns, and it is lying in a relaxed position with one paw stretched out. The car's hood is smooth and reflective, showing some faint reflections. The background features residential buildings with white facades, windows, a roof rack on the car, and a green hedge along the street.

### Step 1 - Allowed Changes List  
**Thinking process:** The instructions specify converting the image into a minimalist chibi-style illustration while retaining certain key elements. Therefore, the following changes are permissible:

- Transform the cat's detailed fur texture into simple gradient color blocks.
- Reduce the car to a curved surface with only reflection lines depicted.
- Change the overall style from a realistic photograph to a chibi illustration.
- Use an irregular shape with a thick white outline and a transparent background.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
- Simplified representation of the cat's fur (from detailed texture to gradient blocks).  
- Reduction of the car to a basic curved surface with simplified reflection lines.  
- Conversion of the entire image to a chibi illustration style.  
- Addition of a thick white outline and transparent background around the sticker.

### Step 2 - Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged  
**Thinking process:** The core recognition elements include the cat's posture and general shape, since these define the subject's identity even in a chibi-style transformation. Functional/logical associations include the cat's interaction with the car (lying on it), ensuring the sticker maintains visual coherence.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
- The cat's curled-up posture and one paw stretched out.  
- The car's curved surface acting as the platform for the cat.  
- Reflection lines indicating the car's surface.  
- The overall positioning of the cat relative to the car (lying on top).

### Step 3 - Generate Yes/No Questions  
{  
    Q1:  
    Thinking process: The curled-up posture and stretched-out paw are iconic for this image. Losing these would make the cat appear differently.

    Choices: Yes, No  
    A: Yes  
    Weight: 3  
}  

{  
    Q2:  
    Thinking process: The cat's interaction with the car is crucial for maintaining the context of the sticker.
    Question: Is the cat shown lying on a curved surface representing the car's hood?
    Choices: Yes, No  
    A: Yes  
    Weight: 2  
}

{  
    Q3:  
    Thinking process: Reflection lines are necessary to indicate that the surface beneath the cat is a car's hood, contributing to scene consistency.
    Question: Are there reflection lines present on the curved surface under the cat?
    Choices: Yes, No  
    A: Yes  
    Weight: 2  
}

{  
    Q4:  
    Thinking process: The thick white outline is critical for defining the sticker's shape in the minimalist style.
    Question: Is the entire sticker image surrounded by a thick white outline?
    Choices: Yes, No  
    A: Yes  
    Weight: 2  
}

{  
    Q5:  
    Thinking process: Transparent background ensures the focus remains on the sticker alone, as per the instructions.
    Question: Does the sticker have a transparent background behind the outlined image?
    Choices: Yes, No  
    A: Yes
