**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is an ornate silver teapot placed on a wooden table in a garden setting. The teapot has a rounded, bulbous body with intricate embossed dragon motifs coiling around its surface, featuring detailed scales, claws, and flowing whiskers. The dragons are depicted in dynamic motion, intertwined with clouds and waves. The spout is elegantly curved, resembling a stylized dragon’s head with open mouth and pointed snout. The lid is domed with a small finial at the top, also decorated with fine filigree patterns. The handle is arched and metallic, with decorative bands at the joints. The base of the teapot is flared and engraved with repeating geometric or floral motifs. The material appears to be polished silver or silver-plated metal, reflecting light with high sheen. The background features soft-focus greenery, pink flowering shrubs, and a lattice screen, suggesting a serene outdoor garden environment. The lighting is natural daylight, creating subtle highlights and shadows that emphasize the relief of the engravings.

**Thinking process:**  
First, analyze the editing instructions word by word:

- *"Transform the ornate silver teapot into a luxury tea brand packaging design."* → This indicates a complete transformation of the object's form and function, from a functional teapot to a product container (tea canister). Therefore, **the overall shape and functionality of the object can change**, but the **design language and visual identity elements must be preserved** where possible.
- *"Convert the body into a sleek cylindrical tea canister"* → The **shape of the body changes** from bulbous to cylindrical; this is explicitly allowed.
- *"Maintaining the dragon engravings"* → The **dragon motifs must be retained**, though their placement may adapt to the new cylindrical form.
- *"Replace the lid with a streamlined metallic screw cap"* → The **lid type changes** from a hinged dome to a screw cap; this is allowed.
- *"Emboss intricate tea leaves around it"* → The **new lid decoration** is specified; this replaces the original lid design.
- *"Inscribe the brand name 'Dragon's Delight' along the spout"* → The **spout now carries text**; this implies the spout may remain or be reimagined as part of the branding.
- *"Add a minimalist tea leaf logo on the cap's top"* → A **new element** is introduced on the cap; this does not affect original elements directly.

Now identify what **can change** based on explicit instruction:

- Shape of the body: changed from bulbous to cylindrical → **allowed**
- Lid mechanism: changed from hinged to screw cap → **allowed**
- Spout: possibly reinterpreted as a label area for text → **allowed**
- Surface decorations: dragon engravings **must be kept**, but their arrangement may adjust
- New additions: tea leaves on cap, brand name, logo → **allowed**

Therefore, only **elements not mentioned in the modification instructions** must be considered for retention unless contradicted.

---

**Allowed Changes List:**  
- The overall form of the teapot body (bulbous → cylindrical)  
- The lid structure (hinged dome → screw cap)  
- The presence and style of the handle (may be removed or modified)  
- The spout shape (may be simplified or used as a branding surface)  
- Addition of new text ("Dragon's Delight") and logo (minimalist tea leaf)  
- Embossing of tea leaves on the cap  
- Material finish (still metallic, but could be modernized)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
Core recognition elements:  
The **dragon engravings** are the most iconic and defining feature of the original teapot. They are not just decorative—they represent cultural symbolism and artistic craftsmanship. The **detailed texture of the dragons**, including scales, claws, facial features, and movement through clouds/waves, are essential for identity recognition. Even if the body becomes cylindrical, the **presence and visual character of the dragons must be preserved**—otherwise, the transformed design loses its connection to the original.

Functional/logical association elements:  
The **spout** is functionally significant—it is where liquid exits. While it may be repurposed for branding, its **position and basic form** should be preserved to maintain logical continuity. If the spout is entirely removed or replaced without any trace, the object would no longer resemble a tea vessel, undermining the functional logic.

Non-modified element deduction:  
The **material appearance** (silver-like, reflective, polished) is implied throughout the description and likely intended to be preserved as part of the "luxury" aesthetic. Although not explicitly stated, the **texture and luster of the metal** contribute to the visual identity. Also, the **embossed nature of the designs** (relief carving) must remain—this is a key detail distinguishing it from flat printing.

Additionally, the **background scene** is not required to be preserved. The instruction focuses only on the teapot’s transformation into packaging, so the **garden setting can be changed or removed**.

Thus, **only those elements explicitly preserved or implied by the transformation logic** must remain.

---

**Preservation Targets List:**  
- The **dragon engravings** (including their form, direction, and relief detail)  
- The **embossed texture** of the metal surface  
- The **spout’s position and basic shape** (as a functional feature)  
- The **material appearance** (silver, reflective, polished)  
- The **overall orientation** of the object (upright, resting on a surface)  

Note: The **handle** is not mentioned in the instructions, so it may be removed or altered. However, since it is part of the original structure and contributes to balance, it might be retained in a modified form. But due to lack of explicit mention, it is not required to be preserved.

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The dragon engravings are the central artistic and symbolic feature of the teapot. Their presence, detailed scales, coiled posture, and interaction with cloud motifs are critical for identifying the object as derived from the original. If these are absent or replaced with generic patterns, the core identity is lost. Thus, preserving the specific form and relief of the dragons is essential.
    Question: Are the embossed dragons with detailed scales, claws, and flowing bodies clearly visible on the body of the object?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The embossed texture of the metal surface is a defining characteristic of the original teapot. It distinguishes it from flat or painted designs and conveys craftsmanship. If the surface becomes smooth or printed, the tactile and visual authenticity is compromised. Since the instruction says "maintaining the dragon engravings," this implies preservation of the raised relief technique.
    Question: Is the surface of the object textured with raised relief patterns, particularly around the dragon motifs?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The spout is a functional and structural component of the teapot. Its shape, especially the dragon-head-like curve, is distinctive. Even if repurposed for branding, its physical presence and general form must be retained to maintain logical continuity between the original and transformed object. Removing or drastically altering it would break the functional analogy.
    Question: Is there a distinct spout extending from the side of the object, shaped like a dragon's head with an open mouth?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The metallic silver appearance with reflective shine is a core visual trait of the original teapot. Changing the color or finish (e.g., to matte black or gold) would alter the perceived luxury and heritage. The instruction mentions "metallic" for the new cap, implying the material tone should be consistent. Thus, the silver hue and reflective quality must be preserved.
    Question: Does the object retain a silver-colored, highly reflective metallic surface?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The object’s upright orientation on a flat surface is a stable compositional element in the original image. It ensures visual coherence and grounding. While the background can change, the object’s position relative to the surface must remain consistent to preserve spatial logic. If it floats or tilts unnaturally, the scene becomes inconsistent.
    Question: Is the object positioned upright on a flat surface, such as a wooden table?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}
