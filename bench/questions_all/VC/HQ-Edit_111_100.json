      "thinking_process": "The fan-shaped headdress is a defining feature of the warrior’s identity, distinguishing it from other statues or figures. It is a core recognition element due to its unique radial structure and placement atop the head. If lost or altered in shape, the statue would no longer be recognizable as this specific cultural or artistic representation. Therefore, preserving its presence and form is critical, making it a 3-point question.",
      "question": "Is the fan-shaped headdress with radiating elements present on the warrior’s head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The central circular emblem on the chest plate is a key ornamental and symbolic detail that anchors the armor design. It serves as a focal point and is structurally distinct from surrounding patterns. Its absence or replacement would alter the identity of the armor, affecting recognition of the figure’s cultural or mythological significance. Thus, it is a high-weight element.",
      "question": "Is there a circular emblem located at the center of the chest plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The spear in the right hand is a functional and symbolic accessory that defines the warrior’s role and posture. Its presence and position are essential for maintaining the intended action and balance of the figure. Changing or removing it would disrupt the narrative and structural integrity of the pose, making it a crucial preservation target.",
      "question": "Is a spear held in the warrior’s right hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The layered armor pattern on the torso and legs is a distinctive design feature that contributes to the statue’s visual complexity and cultural authenticity. While the material may change, the **arrangement and segmentation** of the armor must remain to preserve the original form. Altering this would result in a loss of identity.",
      "question": "Are the torso and legs covered in layered, scale-like armor pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The white pedestal with two informational plaques is explicitly mentioned in the instruction as part of the display setup. Its presence ensures contextual continuity and proper exhibition framing. Removing or altering the pedestal would break the scene logic and violate the requirement to retain the gallery setting.",
      "question": "Is the statue placed on a white pedestal with two visible plaques at the front?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The gallery environment, including the white walls, track lighting, reflective floor, and framed artworks on both sides, is required to be retained per the instruction. These elements establish the context and spatial coherence. Their removal or significant alteration would make the scene inconsistent with the original setting.",
      "question": "Are framed landscape artworks visible on both side walls of the gallery?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The statue’s central positioning and symmetrical alignment within the gallery space contribute to the composition’s balance and aesthetic intent. Deviating from this would disrupt the visual harmony and implied importance of the piece. While minor shifts might be acceptable, the core spatial relationship must be preserved.",
      "question": "Is the statue centered in the gallery space with equal spacing to the side walls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q8",
      "thinking_process": "The shield-like object in the left hand is a secondary but identifiable accessory that complements the warrior’s equipment. Its presence helps define the character’s role and completes the bilateral symmetry of the pose. While less critical than the spear, its omission would reduce fidelity.",
      "question": "Is a shield-like object held in the warrior’s left hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q9",
      "thinking_process": "The facial features—especially the broad nose, deep-set eyes, and stern mouth—are key to recognizing the warrior’s expression and cultural style. While the material may change, these features must remain in form and position to preserve identity. Minor stylization is acceptable, but fundamental alterations would affect recognition.",
      "question": "Does the warrior have a broad nose, deep-set eyes, and a stern mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
