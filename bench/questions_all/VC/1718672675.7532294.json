      "thinking_process": "The layered sedimentary rock structure is a defining feature of the cliffside in the original image, characterized by horizontal strata and vertical erosion lines. These layers are key to identifying the geological nature of the cliff. Even if transformed into armor plating, the underlying pattern of stratification should be preserved to maintain visual coherence with the original. Losing this would make the transformation feel arbitrary and disconnected from the source. Thus, the presence of distinct rock layers is a core visual identifier, warranting 3 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The sun’s reflection on the water forms a bright, elongated path extending from the horizon toward the viewer. This is a critical lighting feature that defines the time of day and atmospheric mood. Although the water may be transformed into spectral limbs, the reflection must still originate from the same sun position and follow a similar trajectory to maintain spatial logic. Its absence would break the lighting consistency of the scene, making the edit feel disjointed. Hence, this is an important scene element worth 2 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The presence of small boats on the water provides scale and realism to the scene. They are minor but meaningful elements that ground the landscape in reality. Even if the water becomes spectral limbs, the boats should still be present, perhaps floating on or near the limbs, to preserve environmental continuity. Removing them would diminish the sense of place and scale. Therefore, their presence is a secondary detail that affects coherence, assigned 1 point.",

      "thinking_process": "The vegetation — particularly shrubs and small trees — grows along the cliff edges and slopes. These plants are integral to the natural ecosystem depicted and help define the texture of the landscape. Though the instruction says trees will form a mane, they must still be located in the same areas (top and sides of cliffs) to maintain spatial fidelity. Their absence would make the transformation feel ungrounded. Thus, their presence in those locations is essential, worth 2 points.",

These elements establish depth and perspective. Even if the entire cliff becomes a titan, the foreground terrain must retain its rocky, grassy character to maintain visual continuity. Altering this would disrupt the viewer’s entry point into the scene. This is a key compositional element, assigned 2 points.",

This specific lighting condition — sunrise or sunset — is crucial to the atmosphere and color balance. While the sky may be replaced with spirits, the sun’s position and the resulting warm light gradient must remain consistent to preserve the time-of-day context.

      "thinking_process": "The cliff edge maintains a steep, continuous drop-off into the water, forming a clear boundary between land and sea. This spatial relationship is fundamental to the scene’s structure. Even if the cliff becomes a titan, the edge must still descend sharply into the water to maintain logical geography. Disrupting this would create a disorienting or illogical layout. This is a functional spatial element, worth 2 points.",
