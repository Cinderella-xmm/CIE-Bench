Description of reference image: The subject consists of two electronic components placed on a neutral beige background. On the left is a smaller rectangular green circuit board with a black NXP semiconductor module mounted centrally. The NXP module has a metallic surface with visible text including "NXP", "DR178", "V1", and other alphanumeric codes such as "C1743BA-CYDB15B0A". The module is surrounded by a grid of gold-plated pins along its edges. The green PCB beneath it has a smooth, matte finish with no visible traces or components. On the right is a larger green printed circuit board (PCB) featuring multiple silver solder points arranged in rows along its perimeter, copper traces forming intricate patterns across its surface, several labeled pads (e.g., "GND", "VCC", "SCL", "SDA"), and a central circular pad. The board also includes printed white text such as "Jenod", "IN5168-00-THX", and component identifiers like "R18", "C2", etc. Both boards are positioned horizontally, parallel to each other, with ample space between them. The background is uniformly beige, flat, and featureless, providing high contrast to the green boards.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions that clearly state what can be changed: the form of the NXP module and the larger green circuit board are to be transformed into a fantastical cyborg beetle. Specifically, the NXP module becomes a metallic, multifaceted eye cluster, and the green board morphs into a chitinous body with bioluminescent spots (from solder points) and glowing wing veins (from traces). The instruction specifies that these transformations should occur while retaining the existing neutral background. Therefore, the allowed changes include:
- The shape, structure, and function of the NXP module
- The shape, structure, and function of the larger green PCB
- The spatial relationship between the two boards (they will be merged)
- The visual interpretation of their components (pins → eye facets, traces → wing veins, solder points → bioluminescent spots)

However, the instruction does **not** allow changes to:
- The **background**: explicitly stated as “poised on the existing neutral background”, so the beige color and flatness must remain unchanged.
- Any **non-transformed elements** not mentioned in the transformation — but since all subject elements are specified for transformation, only the background is preserved by instruction.

Allowed Changes List:
- Shape and form of the NXP module
- Shape and form of the larger green circuit board
- Interpretation of solder points as bioluminescent spots
- Interpretation of copper traces as glowing wing veins
- Interpretation of the NXP module as a multifaceted metallic eye cluster
- Merging of the two boards into a single composite creature

Step 2 - Determine the elements that should remain unchanged  
Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements: While the NXP module and green PCB are being transformed, their **original physical presence** is not required to persist in form, but the **background** is explicitly instructed to remain unchanged. Since the background is described as “existing neutral background,” this implies retention of its **color**, **texture**, and **flatness**. This is a core scene element because any change would violate the instruction’s requirement to preserve the setting.

Functional/logical association elements: There are no functional relationships between the objects and the environment that need to be preserved beyond positional placement. However, the **spatial layout** of the original image (two boards side-by-side) is not preserved — they are to be merged. Thus, no functional logic needs to be retained.

Non-modified element deduction: After excluding the allowed changes (the two boards’ forms), the only remaining element is the **background**. It is not mentioned as being altered, and the instruction says “poised on the existing neutral background,” which means it must be preserved exactly as is. This includes its **beige tone**, **uniformity**, **lack of texture**, and **absence of shadows or gradients**.

Preservation Targets List:  
- The neutral beige background color and flatness  
- The absence of any additional elements or textures in the background  

Q1:  
Thinking process: The background is explicitly required to remain unchanged in the instruction ("poised on the existing neutral background"). Its uniform beige color is a key environmental identifier that anchors the scene. If the background were altered in color, texture, or lighting, it would contradict the instruction and disrupt visual consistency. This is a core scene element, essential for maintaining the intended context and visual coherence. Losing it would make the edited image inconsistent with the instruction's requirements.  
Question: Is the background a uniform beige color without any gradient, pattern, or texture?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The flatness and lack of depth in the background are critical to preserving the original scene’s simplicity and neutrality. A textured or reflective surface would introduce new visual information not present in the original, violating the principle of minimal environmental change. This detail supports the overall integrity of the scene and ensures the focus remains on the transformed subject.  
Question: Does the background have no visible texture, grain, or surface variation?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The absence of shadows or highlights on the background is a key detail indicating even lighting and a flat surface. Introducing shadows would imply depth or object interaction not present in the original, potentially misleading the viewer about the scene’s nature. This detail contributes to the clean, studio-like presentation of the original image.  
Question: Are there no shadows, reflections, or light variations on the background surface?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The position of the two boards relative to the frame is not preserved — they are to be merged. However, the **overall composition** of the image (a horizontal layout with two objects centered) may influence how the final cyborg beetle is placed. But since the instruction allows full transformation, the only preserved spatial element is the background. The **edges of the image** and **frame boundaries** are implicitly preserved as part of the scene.  
Question: Is the image framed with straight edges and no border or crop distortion?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The lighting condition in the original image is consistent and diffuse, with no harsh contrasts or directional highlights. This even illumination is part of the neutral aesthetic and must be preserved if the background is to remain unchanged. Altering the lighting would affect the perceived color and texture of the background, thus violating the preservation requirement.  
Question: Is the lighting on the background evenly distributed with no hotspots or directional shadows?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
