### Step 1: Description of Reference Image and Allowed Changes List

**Description of Reference Image:**  
The image depicts a scene inside a sports team's locker room. The central focus is on a blue jersey with the name "BROCATELI" and the number "9" displayed prominently on a hanger. Surrounding this are four individuals: two players wearing blue jerseys with numbers "21" and another partially visible, a goalkeeper in green, and a man in a suit gesturing animatedly. The background consists of wooden lockers, and the overall setting suggests a pre-game or post-game discussion.

**Thinking Process:**  
The editing instructions specify transforming the locker room into a mid-century modern showroom and replacing the jersey with a piece of designer furniture. This means the background, setting, and the jersey can be altered. However, the individuals and their positions relative to each other should remain consistent to maintain the scene's logic.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
1. The locker room setting can be changed to a mid-century modern showroom.
2. The jersey can be replaced with a luxurious piece of designer furniture.
3. The background elements (lockers, lighting, etc.) can be modified to fit the new setting.

### Step 2: Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged

**Thinking Process:**  
Core recognition elements include the individuals' appearances, their positions, and their interactions. Functional/logical association elements involve the spatial arrangement and gestures that convey the ongoing conversation. Remaining elements like the jersey's placement and the individuals' attire contribute to visual coherence.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
1. The individuals' appearances and positions.
2. The man in the suit's gesture and interaction with the others.
3. The general spatial arrangement of the characters.

### Step 3: Generate Yes/No Questions

**Q1:**  
Thinking process: The individuals' appearances are crucial for recognizing them as the same people even in a different setting. Their facial features, hairstyles, and body types are key identifiers.
Question: Are the individuals' facial features, hairstyles, and body types retained in the edited image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
Weight: 3

**Q2:**  
Thinking process: The man in the suit's gesture is a key action that conveys the scene's dynamics. Losing this would disrupt the interaction's logic.
Question: Is the man in the suit still gesturing with his hands in the same manner as in the original image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
Weight: 2

**Q3:**  
Thinking process: The spatial arrangement helps maintain the scene's coherence. The relative positions of the characters should stay consistent.
Question: Are the relative positions of the characters (e.g., who is standing next to whom) retained in the edited image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
Weight: 2

**Q4:**  
Thinking process: The individuals' attire contributes to their identities. While the setting changes, their clothing should remain recognizable.
Question: Are the individuals still wearing the same type of clothing (e.g., jerseys, suit) as in the original image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
Weight: 2

**Q5:**  
Thinking process: The jersey's placement serves as a focal point in the original image. Its replacement should be logically positioned in the new setting.
Question: Is there a clear focal point in the new setting that replaces the jersey's position in the original image?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
