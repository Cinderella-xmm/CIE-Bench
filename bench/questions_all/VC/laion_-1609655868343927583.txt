**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a vintage wooden cabinet with a semi-circular, polished marble top featuring a mottled pattern of yellow, red, and beige tones. The cabinet body is crafted from light brown wood with a herringbone inlay pattern visible on the drawer fronts and side panel. It has two curved drawers stacked vertically, both partially open, revealing dark interior linings. Each drawer is framed by brass trim and fitted with ornate brass hardware: circular ring pulls flanked by decorative escutcheons. The cabinet stands on four slender, tapered legs made of the same wood, ending in small brass caps. The front left side features a vertical panel with a similar herringbone design, bordered by brass inlays and accented with a central brass foliate motif. The background consists of a dark gray textured wall, possibly acoustic foam, and the floor is a light-colored wooden plank surface.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction explicitly transforms the cabinet into an anthropomorphic character. This means the **form and function** of the object are to be reimagined entirely. Key transformation points include:
- The **marble top** becomes a **royal crown with gemstone inlays**, implying its shape and material can change.
- The **body** morphs into an **ornate robe**, meaning the structure and appearance of the cabinet’s main body are altered.
- The **drawer engravings** become **belt buckles**, so their decorative patterns may be preserved but repurposed.
- The **legs** turn into **regal clawed feet**, indicating the leg form must be changed.
- The **drawers open like functional pouches**, suggesting they remain functional but visually transformed.

From this, we deduce:
- The **marble top's shape and material** are allowed to change (becomes crown).
- The **wooden body structure** is allowed to change (becomes robe).
- The **drawer hardware and inlay patterns** may be preserved but recontextualized as belt buckles.
- The **leg shape** is allowed to change (to clawed feet).
- The **functionality of drawers** is retained conceptually (as pouches), but not necessarily in original form.

However, the instruction does **not** specify changes to the **background**, nor does it require altering the **texture of the wood**, **brass hardware details**, or **herringbone inlay pattern**—these are **not mentioned for modification**, so they may need to be retained unless explicitly transformed.

Thus, **only elements directly referenced in the transformation** are allowed to change. All others must remain consistent unless implied by transformation.

**Allowed Changes List:**
- Shape and function of the marble top (now a crown)
- Overall form of the cabinet body (now a robe)
- Shape and positioning of the legs (now clawed feet)
- Function and visual role of the drawers (now pouches)
- Interpretation of drawer hardware (now belt buckles)
- General silhouette and structural outline (transformed into humanoid figure)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
We now identify what **must be preserved** based on exclusion from the "allowed changes" list and core identity logic:

1. **Core recognition elements**:  
   - The **herringbone wood inlay pattern** is a defining feature of the cabinet’s craftsmanship and historical style (likely Neoclassical or Regency). If lost, the object loses its distinctive aesthetic identity. Even if transformed into a robe, the **pattern must be retained** as part of the fabric texture.
   - The **brass hardware** (ring pulls and escutcheons) are iconic decorative elements; their **design and placement** should be preserved, even if reinterpreted as belt buckles.
   - The **color palette** of the wood (warm amber-brown) and brass (golden-yellow) contributes to the piece’s authenticity. These colors should be maintained unless overridden by the new theme (e.g., royal gold), but since the instruction doesn’t specify color change, they must be preserved.
   - The **semi-circular top edge** may be transformed, but its **original curvature** could inform the crown’s shape—so the **curve itself** might be preserved in silhouette.

2. **Functional/logical association elements**:  
   - The **two drawers** must retain their **number and relative position** because they are being transformed into **pouches**—this implies preservation of quantity and spatial relationship.
   - The **vertical alignment** of drawers and the **side panel** must be respected to maintain logical continuity in the transformation (e.g., pouches aligned vertically on a robe).

3. **Non-modified element deduction**:  
   - The **brass foliate motif** on the side panel is unique and decorative; it is not mentioned in the instructions, so it should be preserved as a detail.
   - The **tapered legs**’ **proportion and material** (wood with brass caps) are not specified to change, only their form—so **material consistency** (wood + brass) and **cap presence** must remain.
   - The **interior darkness of the drawers** suggests depth and functionality; while the drawers become pouches, their **depth and accessibility** should be preserved.

Therefore, while the **overall shape and purpose** of the cabinet are changed, the **visual textures, materials, patterns, and key decorative elements** must be retained to ensure coherence between the original and edited versions.

**Preservation Targets List:**
- Herringbone wood inlay pattern
- Brass hardware (ring pulls and escutcheons) including their design and placement
- Warm amber-brown wood tone
- Brass caps on the legs
- Tapered leg shape (slender, straight, downward taper)
- Vertical alignment of two drawers
- Side panel with brass foliate motif
- Semi-circular top edge curve
- Interior darkness of drawers

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Preservation Targets**

Q1:  
Thinking process: The herringbone wood inlay pattern is the most distinctive visual feature of the cabinet’s surface, serving as a hallmark of its craftsmanship and period style. It is not mentioned in the editing instruction to be removed or replaced, so it must be preserved—even if transformed into a robe texture. Losing this pattern would make the edited character unrecognizable as derived from the original cabinet. Thus, this is a core identity element, warranting 3 points.  
Question: Is the herringbone wood inlay pattern present on the surface of the transformed character?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The brass ring pulls and escutcheons are signature hardware elements that define the cabinet’s decorative style. They are specifically referenced in the instruction to become “elaborate belt buckles,” which implies their **design and placement** are to be reused, not discarded. Therefore, their **presence and configuration** must be preserved, even if stylized. This is a key functional-to-symbolic transformation, making it a critical retention point.  
Question: Are the circular brass ring pulls and adjacent escutcheons present on the transformed character’s waist area, matching their original positions?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The warm amber-brown tone of the wood is essential to the cabinet’s identity and aesthetic. While the instruction allows transformation into a regal character, it does not specify a color change. Preserving the original wood color ensures visual continuity and authenticity. A shift to unrelated hues (e.g., black or blue) would break the connection to the source object. This is a core material attribute, thus weight 3.  
Question: Does the transformed character retain the original warm amber-brown wood color as the base tone of its body?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The brass caps at the bottom of each leg are minor but distinctive details that confirm the cabinet’s construction. They are not mentioned in the transformation instruction, so they must be preserved. Their loss would result in incomplete or inaccurate representation of the original object. While not core, they contribute to visual fidelity and are therefore important enough for 2 points.  
Question: Do the transformed character’s feet retain small brass caps at their ends, corresponding to the original leg caps?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The tapered leg shape is a defining structural feature of the cabinet. Although the legs are to become clawed feet, the **tapered form** may inform the shape of the claws. Since the instruction does not specify abandoning the taper, it must be preserved in the transformation. This maintains proportional logic and visual coherence.  
Question: Are the legs of the transformed character still tapered, narrowing from top to bottom, consistent with the original cabinet legs?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The vertical alignment of the two drawers is a key spatial feature. The instruction states they become “functional pouches,” implying their **stacked arrangement** must be preserved. Disrupting this layout would contradict the transformation logic and reduce coherence. This is a structural necessity, hence 2 points.  
Question: Are the two drawers/pouches positioned vertically one above the other on the transformed character, maintaining their original stacking order?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The brass foliate motif on the side panel is a unique decorative detail not mentioned in the transformation. Its absence would remove a distinctive visual marker of the original cabinet. Though minor, it contributes to authenticity and must be preserved as part of the robe’s ornamentation. This is a detail-level element, thus 1 point.  
Question: Is the brass foliate motif visible on the side of the transformed character’s torso, in the same location as the original cabinet?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q8:  
Thinking process: The semi-circular top edge defines the cabinet’s silhouette. While it becomes a crown, the **curved contour** likely informs the crown’s shape. Since the instruction does not state removal of the curve, it must be preserved in form. This is a key silhouette element, critical for identity retention, so weight 2.  
Question: Does the crown portion of the transformed character retain the original semi-circular edge shape of the marble top?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q9:  
Thinking process: The interior darkness of the drawers indicates depth and functionality. While transformed into pouches, the **sense of depth** must be preserved to maintain logical consistency. If the pouches appear flat or solid, the transformation fails. This is a subtle but important functional detail, so weight 1.  
Question: Do the transformed pouches retain a dark interior, suggesting depth and openness, consistent with the original drawer interiors?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1
