      "thinking_process": "The \"Indian\" script logo is the primary brand identifier on the motorcycle and is essential for recognizing it as an Indian Motorcycle. It appears in cursive font on the white fuel tank and is a unique visual element that distinguishes it from other brands. Losing this logo would render the object unidentifiable as an Indian product, making it a core identity feature. Therefore, its presence and legibility must be preserved, even in a stylized form.",
      "question": "Is the \"Indian\" script logo visible and legible on the fuel tank?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The V-twin engine layout is a defining characteristic of Indian motorcycles, especially the Scout model. The two cylinders arranged in a V-shape are visually distinct and serve as a key recognition feature. Altering this configuration (e.g., changing to inline or removing cylinders) would fundamentally change the motorcycle's identity. Thus, preserving the V-shape is crucial for maintaining the correct model identification.",
      "question": "Are the engine cylinders arranged in a V-shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The chrome exhaust pipes are a signature design element of this model, extending from the engine along the right side of the frame. Their polished metal finish and dual-pipe configuration are highly recognizable. Even if modified with neon glow, their placement and form must remain consistent to preserve the bike’s identity. Removing or relocating them would disrupt the visual balance and recognition.",
      "question": "Are there two chrome exhaust pipes running along the right side of the motorcycle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The black leather seat is a standard feature of the Indian Scout and contributes to its cruiser aesthetic. Its position above the engine and behind the fuel tank defines the rider’s posture and is part of the bike’s silhouette. While color or texture may be altered, the seat’s location and basic shape must remain unchanged to maintain structural consistency.",
      "question": "Is there a black leather seat located above the engine and behind the fuel tank?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The white fuel tank with smooth, rounded contours is a core visual component of the motorcycle’s design. Its shape and color contrast with the black engine and frame, forming a key part of the bike’s identity. Changing its shape or color would alter the model’s appearance significantly. Therefore, its form and color must be preserved.",
      "question": "Is the fuel tank white and smooth with rounded contours?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The spatial relationship between the engine and exhaust system is functionally logical and visually coherent. The exhaust pipes originate from the engine and extend outward, which is essential for realism and design integrity. Disrupting this connection would make the motorcycle appear non-functional, even in a stylized version. Hence, this relational detail must be retained.",
      "question": "Do the exhaust pipes connect directly to the engine block?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The low-slung, cruiser-style silhouette—characterized by a forward-leaning stance, wide handlebars, and long wheelbase—is essential for identifying the bike as a Scout. This profile is distinct from sport or touring models. While proportions may be slightly exaggerated in a collectible, the overall shape must remain recognizable.",
      "question": "Does the motorcycle have a low-slung, cruiser-style silhouette with a forward-leaning stance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
