### Step 1 - Allowed Changes List  
Thinking process: Based on the instructions:  

1. **Specific element 1 that allows for changes**: The subject's portrayal as a "chibi-style" version means alterations to the physical proportions, facial features, and pose are acceptable.  
2. **Specific element 2 that allows for changes**: The keychain being described as "soft rubber" implies altering the material texture from realistic painting textures to a simplified rubber design.  
3. **Specific element 3 that allows for changes**: The addition of bold black outlines around the chibi figure and attaching it to a small silver keyring indicates incorporating these new elements.  
4. **Specific element 4 that allows for changes**: The background can be changed to a neutral setting since the instructions do not emphasize maintaining the original dark background.

### Step 2 - Preservation Targets List  
Thinking process:  

- **Core recognition elements**: The iconic chibi character must retain key features for identity: the pearl earring, headscarf colors, and the subjectâ€™s overall pose.  
- **Functional/logical association elements**: The keychain being held by a hand implies maintaining the hand and the attachment point for the key ring.  
- **Visual coherence elements**: The colors and basic shapes of the clothing and headscarf should remain consistent despite stylistic simplification.  

Preservation Targets List:  
(Element 1 that should be maintained): Pearl earring.  
(Element 2 that should be maintained): Headscarf colors and structure.  
(Element 3 that should be maintained): Basic clothing colors and shape.  
(Element 4 that should be maintained): Subject's pose (direction faced).
