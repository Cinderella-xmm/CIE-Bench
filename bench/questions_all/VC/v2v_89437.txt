Description of reference image: The subject is an infographic titled "ALSC 5 Easy Steps" designed for documents to be used in Qatar. It features a large black checkmark-shaped pathway that serves as the central visual structure, with five orange circular step markers placed along its length. Each orange circle contains a white icon representing a specific service step: (1) a magnifying glass over a document labeled "We verify your Document", (2) two figures running labeled "You choose how fast", (3) a person placing a document into a frame labeled "Use our shipping solutions", (4) a figure holding a document with a checkmark labeled "We take care of the rest", and (5) a building with a flag and clock labeled "We confirm embassy requirements for Qatar". Blue dots connect the orange circles along the black checkmark path. The text "ALSC 5 Easy Steps" is displayed at the top in bold blue font, with a subtitle "For documents to be used in Qatar" beneath it. In the bottom right corner, the ALSC logo appears, consisting of the letters "ALSC" in blue with a stylized black checkmark integrated into the design, and the full name "AUTHENTICATION LEGALIZATION SERVICES CANADA" written below in smaller black capital letters. The background is plain white, emphasizing clarity and readability.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions word by word. The instruction specifies modifying the black checkmark pathway to become "tangled and circuitous", which means the original straight and clean shape of the checkmark can be altered in form and trajectory. The "We verify your Document" icon is to show "multiple overlapping stamps of approval", indicating that the original single magnifying glass icon can be replaced or layered with additional stamp-like graphics. A "subtle visual motif of entangled red tape woven through the orange circular step markers" is to be added, meaning red tape elements can be introduced across the orange circles. However, the instruction does not mention changing the text content, the color scheme of the icons (orange), the presence of the five steps, the overall layout of the infographic, or the ALSC logo. Therefore, the core textual information, the number and position of the steps, the orange color of the step markers, the white icons within them, and the ALSC branding must remain intact. The scene environment (white background) is not mentioned for change, so it should be preserved. The functional logic of the five-step process must also be maintained, even if the pathway becomes tangled.

Allowed Changes List:
- The shape and trajectory of the black checkmark pathway (can become tangled and circuitous)
- The icon inside the "We verify your Document" step (can include multiple overlapping stamps)
- Addition of red tape motifs woven through the orange circular step markers
- Visual texture and flow of the pathway (can be made more complex)

Step 2- Determine the elements that should remain unchanged

Thinking process:
Core recognition elements: The ALSC logo is a key brand identifier; its presence, blue color, and integration of the checkmark are essential for brand recognition. The five-step structure is central to the infographic’s function—changing the number or order would alter its informational purpose. The orange circular step markers are distinctive visual cues for each stage; their color and circular shape are critical for consistency. The white icons within each circle represent specific services and are essential for understanding the process. The text labels ("We verify your Document", etc.) are functional and must remain legible and accurate to preserve meaning.

Functional/logical association elements: The sequence of the five steps must be preserved in order to maintain logical progression. The connection between the blue dots and the orange circles indicates step-by-step flow, which must remain intact. The relationship between the checkmark pathway and the placement of the steps must be preserved—even if the path is tangled, the steps must still align with it in a way that maintains their sequential order.

Non modified element deduction: After excluding allowed changes (pathway shape, icon details, red tape), the remaining elements—such as the exact wording, the orange color of the circles, the white icons, the blue dots, the ALSC logo, and the white background—are all part of the original visual identity and must be retained. These elements ensure the edited version remains recognizable as the same infographic, despite stylistic modifications.

Preservation Targets List:
- The five orange circular step markers
- The white icons inside each orange circle
- The text labels associated with each step
- The ALSC logo in the bottom right corner
- The blue dots connecting the steps along the pathway
- The white background
- The title "ALSC 5 Easy Steps" and subtitle "For documents to be used in Qatar"
- The sequential arrangement of the five steps from bottom-left to top-right

Q1:  
Thinking process: The ALSC logo is a core brand identifier, featuring the stylized checkmark integrated into the blue "ALSC" text and the full company name below. This combination is unique to the organization and essential for brand recognition. If the logo is altered in shape, color, or text, the image loses its official identity. The presence and correct rendering of this logo are critical for maintaining authenticity and trustworthiness. Therefore, this element is assigned a weight of 3 points.
Question: Is the ALSC logo present in the bottom right corner with the blue "ALSC" text, the integrated black checkmark, and the full name "AUTHENTICATION LEGALIZATION SERVICES CANADA" in black capital letters below it?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The five orange circular step markers are the primary visual indicators of the process stages. Their consistent orange color and circular shape are key to identifying each step. Changing their color or shape would disrupt the visual hierarchy and make the infographic confusing. Since the instruction allows only the addition of red tape, the base form and color of these circles must remain unchanged. This is a core structural element, hence a weight of 3 points.
Question: Are there exactly five orange circular markers positioned along the black checkmark pathway, each containing a white icon?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The white icons inside each orange circle represent specific actions (e.g., magnifying glass, running figures). These are functional symbols that convey the meaning of each step. Even though the "We verify your Document" icon may gain additional stamps, the original icon must still be visible and identifiable. Altering other icons would misrepresent the service offered. Thus, the presence and integrity of these icons are crucial, assigning a weight of 3 points.
Question: Is the icon in the first orange circle (bottom-left) a white magnifying glass over a document?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The text labels next to each step provide essential information about the service. They are functional and must remain unaltered to preserve the message. The instruction does not mention changing any text, so all labels must be preserved exactly as in the original. Losing or altering any label would compromise the infographic's informational value. This is a key functional element, thus a weight of 3 points.
Question: Is the text next to the first orange circle "We verify your Document"?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The blue dots connecting the orange circles along the pathway serve as visual connectors that reinforce the sequential nature of the steps. While the pathway itself may become tangled, the blue dots must remain to maintain the flow and continuity of the process. Their presence ensures the viewer understands the progression. This is an important structural detail, so it is assigned a weight of 2 points.
Question: Are there five blue dots placed along the black checkmark pathway, one between each pair of adjacent orange circles?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The title "ALSC 5 Easy Steps" and the subtitle "For documents to be used in Qatar" are essential for context and identification. They define the purpose of the infographic. The instruction does not allow modification of text, so these must remain unchanged. Their presence ensures the image is correctly understood. This is a key informational element, thus a weight of 3 points.
Question: Is the title "ALSC 5 Easy Steps" displayed at the top in bold blue font, with the subtitle "For documents to be used in Qatar" directly below it in smaller blue font?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The white background provides contrast and clarity, ensuring the colorful elements stand out. Although not explicitly mentioned, the instruction does not require changing the background, so it should remain white. A changed background could distract or obscure the content. This is a minor but important environmental detail, so it is assigned a weight of 1 point.
Question: Is the background of the image plain white with no patterns, textures, or colors?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1
