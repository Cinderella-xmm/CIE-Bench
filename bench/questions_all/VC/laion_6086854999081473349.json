      "thinking_process": "The two garage doors are core architectural features of the cabin’s front façade. Their side-by-side alignment and position below the upper window section define the building’s functional symmetry. Changing their location or eliminating them entirely would alter the fundamental structure. Thus, their **presence and alignment** are essential for maintaining identity, making this a weight-3 element.",
      "question": "Are the two garage doors positioned side by side on the lower front portion of the cabin, directly beneath the large upper window section?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The large upper window section with exposed wooden framing is a distinctive feature that defines the cabin’s aesthetic and structural openness. It is located above the garage doors and spans nearly the full width of the front. Its **shape and position** are critical for identifying the original structure. Removing or relocating it would break the architectural coherence. This is a key visual identifier, hence weight-3.",
      "question": "Is there a large, multi-pane window section with exposed wooden beams located directly above the two garage doors, spanning most of the front width of the cabin?",

      "thinking_process": "The small rectangular window on the left side is a minor but identifiable detail. Its presence contributes to the asymmetry of the façade and helps distinguish this specific cabin from others. Since it is not mentioned in the editing instructions, it must remain in place to preserve fidelity to the original layout. This is a secondary but necessary detail, hence weight-2.",
      "question": "Is there a small rectangular window cut into the log wall on the left side of the cabin, near the front corner?",

      "thinking_process": "The doorway adjacent to the small window is a functional entrance. Though not prominent, it provides logical access and completes the left-side composition. Its **position relative to the window** is fixed in the original and must be preserved to maintain spatial accuracy. This is a logical consistency element, thus weight-2.",
      "question": "Is there a doorway located immediately to the right of the small rectangular window on the left side of the cabin?",

      "thinking_process": "The concrete foundation base is a non-wooden, visually distinct element that supports the log structure. It is present beneath all sides of the cabin and is crucial for grounding the building. Since it is not mentioned for transformation, its **presence and placement** must be retained to preserve structural realism. This is a foundational detail, hence weight-2.",
      "question": "Is there a continuous concrete foundation base running beneath the log walls of the cabin, visible along the lower perimeter?",

      "thinking_process": "The overall orientation of the cabin—facing slightly to the right—is a key spatial cue. It affects how the viewer perceives depth and proportion. Altering this angle would make the scene appear disoriented or inconsistent with the original. This is a perspective-based detail that supports visual coherence, thus weight-1.",
      "question": "Is the cabin oriented such that its front façade is angled slightly toward the right side of the image, with the left side receding into the background?",
