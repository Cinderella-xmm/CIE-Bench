**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a woman performing a yoga pose on a beach at sunset. She stands on her right foot, balancing with her left leg bent and raised, grasping her left foot with both hands behind her back. Her arms form an elegant arch above her head, with her left hand extended upward in a graceful line. She wears a dark green sports bra and black high-waisted leggings. Her hair is tied into a neat bun, with a few loose strands falling to the side. The background features a large, glowing sun positioned directly behind her, casting a warm golden hue across the sky and reflecting on the wet sand. Gentle ocean waves roll toward the shore, with two rocky outcrops visible in the distance—one on the left and one on the right. The horizon line is clearly defined, separating the calm sea from the gradient sky transitioning from orange near the sun to soft blue at the edges. The lighting emphasizes long shadows and soft highlights, enhancing the serene atmosphere.

Thinking process:  
The editing instructions specify transforming the image into a **cartoonized serene figure** performing a yoga pose, with **stylized beach elements**, **calming earth tones**, and **exaggerated posture lines**. It also mentions creating a **photo album with textured covers** and including **yoga tips** on each card. However, no explicit instruction states that the **core identity of the yoga pose**, **the subject’s silhouette**, or **the beach setting** should be removed or fundamentally altered—only stylized. The transformation is artistic but must preserve recognizable content.  

Key phrases indicating allowed changes:  
- "Cartoonized" → implies stylistic simplification, exaggeration, and possibly smoother outlines or reduced realism  
- "Stylized beach elements" → allows for abstracted rocks, waves, or horizon  
- "Elongated and gracefully exaggerated posture lines" → permits stretching of limbs or body proportions  
- "Harmonious color palette of calming earth tones" → allows recoloring within a naturalistic range (e.g., warmer browns, tans, soft greens)  
- "Panorama cards", "textured covers", "yoga tip" → these are new additions not part of original image; thus, they are not retention requirements  

However, the instructions do **not** say to remove or replace:  
- The yoga pose itself  
- The beach environment (though stylized)  
- The sun as a central light source  
- The subject’s gender, orientation, or core action  

Therefore, while style and proportions can change, the **essential visual narrative**—a person doing a standing yoga pose on a beach at sunset—must remain identifiable.

Allowed Changes List:  
- Hairstyle (can be simplified or cartoonish)  
- Clothing texture and detail (can be flattened or simplified)  
- Proportions of limbs (can be elongated or exaggerated)  
- Color palette (within earth tone constraints)  
- Background details (rocks, waves, sky gradients can be stylized)  
- Lighting intensity and direction (can be adjusted for mood, but sun position should remain consistent)  
- Artistic style (realism → cartoonized)  
- Addition of text (yoga tip), frames, textures (album cover), etc.—these are new elements, not part of original

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements:  
- The **yoga pose** is the central theme. The specific pose—**Natarajasana (Dancer Pose)**—is defined by the lifted leg being held behind the back, the supporting leg straight, and the arm extension. This pose is iconic and functionally distinct. Changing it would misrepresent the subject’s activity. Even if stylized, the **basic structure** of the pose (one leg up, hands holding foot, balance on one leg) must be preserved.  
- The **sun position** behind the figure is critical to the composition and emotional tone. It creates backlighting and silhouette effect. Removing or relocating it would destroy the scene’s harmony and visual anchor.  
- The **beach setting**—including the **wet sand**, **ocean waves**, and **rock formations**—establishes the location. While stylized, these elements must remain present to maintain environmental context.  
- The **subject’s bare feet** and **standing balance** are functional aspects of the pose. If she were shown wearing shoes or floating, the authenticity of the yoga practice would be lost.  
- The **direction of gaze and head tilt** (upward, eyes closed) contributes to the serene expression. Though facial features may simplify, the upward-facing head must remain.  

Functional/logical association elements:  
- The **balance on one foot** is essential to the pose’s mechanics. If both feet were on ground, it would not be Natarajasana.  
- The **hand grasp on the lifted foot** is a defining feature of this pose. Without it, the pose becomes unrecognizable.  
- The **sun’s role as a backlight source** affects shadow direction and silhouette shape. Altering its position would disrupt spatial logic.  

Non-modified element deduction:  
After excluding allowed changes (style, colors, proportions), the following **visual facts** from the original image must remain:  
- The **pose’s structural integrity** (one leg up, hands holding foot, upright spine)  
- The **presence of the sun** in the background behind the figure  
- The **beach surface** (wet sand with reflections)  
- The **ocean waves** rolling in  
- The **two distant rock formations** (left and right)  
- The **barefoot stance**  
- The **head turned upward**  
- The **bun hairstyle** (as a key identifier of the subject’s appearance)  

These elements are not mentioned as changeable, and their removal would break the image’s identity and logical consistency.

Preservation Targets List:  
- The Natarajasana yoga pose structure (one leg raised, hands holding foot, balanced on one leg)  
- The sun positioned directly behind the figure, creating backlighting  
- The presence of wet sandy beach with reflective surface  
- The ocean with rolling waves approaching the shore  
- Two rocky outcrops visible in the distance (one on left, one on right)  
- The subject’s bare feet in contact with the sand  
- The subject’s head tilted upward with eyes closed or looking up  
- The bun hairstyle on the subject’s head

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

Q1:  
Thinking process: The Natarajasana pose is uniquely identified by the raised leg being held behind the back with both hands, while balancing on the opposite foot. This is the core functional and visual identifier of the pose. If the hands are not gripping the foot or the leg is not elevated, the pose is unrecognizable. This is a 3-point element because it defines the subject’s activity and purpose of the image.  
Question: Is the subject’s left leg raised and held behind her back with both hands?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The sun is positioned directly behind the figure, creating a strong silhouette and golden backlight. This is a key compositional element that anchors the scene and establishes time (sunset). Removing or repositioning the sun would fundamentally alter the atmosphere and visual balance. Its placement relative to the subject is essential.  
Question: Is the sun located directly behind the subject’s torso, forming a halo-like glow around her silhouette?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The wet sandy beach with visible reflections of the sun and water is a defining environmental feature. It provides grounding for the pose and connects the figure to the natural setting. Stylization can occur, but the reflective surface must remain to preserve the sense of dampness and time of day.  
Question: Is the beach surface visibly wet, showing reflections of the sun and ocean waves?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The two distant rock formations—one on the left, one on the right—are key landscape markers that establish depth and symmetry. Their presence helps frame the scene. While their shape may be stylized, their existence and approximate positions must be retained to maintain spatial coherence.  
Question: Are there two distinct rocky landforms visible in the background, one on the left and one on the right side of the frame?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The subject’s bare feet are essential to the authenticity of the yoga practice. Wearing footwear would contradict the typical depiction of yoga and affect the pose’s balance. The foot must be planted firmly on the sand.  
Question: Is the subject standing barefoot on the sand, with the sole of her right foot flat against the ground?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The bun hairstyle is a clear identifier of the subject’s appearance. While cartoonization may simplify it, the presence of a bun is necessary to maintain continuity with the original character. A different hairstyle (e.g., loose hair) would make the figure visually distinct.  
Question: Is the subject’s hair tied into a neat bun at the back of her head?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The upward tilt of the head and closed eyes contribute to the serene expression required by the yoga theme. While facial features may be simplified, the direction of the gaze (upward) must remain to convey tranquility and focus.  
Question: Is the subject’s head tilted upward, with her face angled toward the sky?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q8:  
Thinking process: The ocean waves rolling toward the shore are a key element of the beach environment. They provide motion and context. Even if stylized, the presence of waves approaching the shore must be preserved.  
Question: Are there visible ocean waves breaking along the shoreline in front of the subject?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1
