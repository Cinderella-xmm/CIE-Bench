**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is an elderly man standing in the center of a sunlit Moroccan souk, facing slightly to the left with a gentle smile. He wears a traditional long robe (djellaba) with vertical striped patterns in beige, black, and brown, featuring ornate embroidered borders along the edges. A white turban is wrapped around his head, and he has a full, white beard. In his right hand, he holds a simple wooden cane with a curved top; in his left, he carries a carved wooden box containing a bouquet of bright orange and pink marigold-like flowers. The market behind him is bustling: spice stalls display mounds of colorful dried goods—saffron yellow, deep red, and dark blue—in large clay pots. Above, hanging textiles, beaded necklaces, and woven bags drape from awnings. To the left, a woman in a turquoise hijab walks away. In the background, a tall, pale pink minaret rises against a hazy sky. The ground is paved with light-colored stone tiles arranged in a grid pattern. Sunlight casts soft shadows across the scene, creating a warm, golden atmosphere.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instructions specify several transformations:
- "Transform the scene into a series of market-themed art postcards": This implies artistic stylization but does not require changing the core identity or structure of the scene.
- "Depict the elderly man's robe in vibrant, exaggerated geometric patterns": This allows modification of the robe’s design and color scheme.
- "Turning his cane into an ornate wooden staff": The form and decoration of the cane are permitted to change.
- "Render the spice stalls behind with enhanced saturation for vivid allure": Color saturation of the spice displays may be increased.
- "Integrate a decorative blank writing area with Moroccan-inspired border motifs": A new element will be added to the image, likely at the bottom or side, which was not present originally.

From this, we extract the **allowed changes**:
- The **robe’s pattern and color** can be altered to include vibrant, exaggerated geometric designs.
- The **cane** can be transformed into an ornate wooden staff (form, texture, ornamentation).
- The **spice stall colors** can be intensified in saturation.
- A **new blank writing area with Moroccan border motifs** may be added.

These changes affect only specific visual attributes and do not mandate removal or alteration of foundational elements such as the man’s presence, posture, facial features, or overall layout of the market.

**Allowed Changes List:**
- The pattern and color of the elderly man’s robe
- The shape and ornamentation of the cane
- The color saturation of the spice stalls
- The addition of a decorative blank writing area with Moroccan border motifs

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
We now identify what **must remain unchanged** based on exclusion from the allowed changes list and logical consistency:

**Core recognition elements:**  
- The **elderly man’s identity** is central to the image. While his robe and cane may change, his **facial features** (white beard, smiling expression, turban), **posture**, and **position in the scene** must remain intact. These are essential for recognizing him as the original subject. His **presence as a central figure** in the market is critical.
- The **market setting** is preserved in the instruction ("market-themed art postcards"), so the **overall spatial layout**—including the **stone-paved walkway**, **spice stalls**, **hanging textiles**, **woman in turquoise hijab**, and **minaret in the distance**—must remain recognizable. Even if colors are enhanced, the **structural composition** must be maintained.
- The **carved wooden box** with flowers is a key accessory held by the man. It is not mentioned as being changed, so it should remain visually consistent in form and placement.

**Functional/logical association elements:**  
- The man **holds the cane in his right hand** and the **box in his left**. These actions define his interaction with objects. If the cane is replaced with a staff, its **function as a walking aid** must still be implied by its position and use. Similarly, the **box must still be carried in the left hand** to preserve logical coherence.
- The **spice stalls** are positioned along both sides of the path. Their **arrangement** (clay pots stacked, spices piled high) must remain spatially accurate even if saturated.
- The **woman in turquoise hijab** is a secondary figure whose presence adds depth and cultural context. She should remain in her approximate location and orientation.

**Non-modified element deduction:**  
After removing allowed changes (robe pattern, cane style, spice saturation, added text area), all other visual details must be retained:
- The **texture of the stone pavement**
- The **shape and arrangement of the spice mounds**
- The **design of the hanging textiles and lanterns**
- The **architectural form of the minaret**
- The **man’s facial features and turban**
- The **wooden box with flowers** (its shape, material, and contents)
- The **relative positions of people and stalls**

These ensure visual continuity and prevent the edited image from becoming unrecognizable or logically inconsistent.

**Preservation Targets List:**
- The elderly man’s face, including white beard, smiling expression, and turban
- The man’s posture: standing upright, facing slightly left, holding objects in each hand
- The position and form of the carved wooden box with flowers in the left hand
- The presence and general location of the woman in the turquoise hijab
- The stone-paved pathway with grid pattern
- The spice stalls with clay pots and colored spice piles
- The hanging textiles and lanterns above the stalls
- The distant minaret in the background
- The relative spatial layout of the market scene (two-sided stalls, central walkway)

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

Q1:  
Thinking process: The elderly man’s white beard is a core identification feature that distinguishes him from others in the scene. Its presence and texture are essential for recognizing him as the original subject. Changing or removing it would fundamentally alter his identity. Therefore, this is a key recognition element with a weight of 3 points.  
Question: Is the elderly man’s full white beard clearly visible and present?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The turban worn by the man is a culturally significant and visually distinct element that contributes to his identity. Its shape and placement on the head are unique and must be preserved to maintain authenticity. Altering it would misrepresent the character. This is a core identity feature, thus weighted 3 points.  
Question: Is the white turban wrapped around the man’s head in a traditional style?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:
