      "thinking_process": "The circular clock face is the core functional element of any analog clock. Its presence and central positioning are essential for identification. If it were absent or misplaced, the object would no longer be recognizable as a clock. Even when transformed into crystal, its **circular shape and central location** must remain. This is a **core identity feature**, hence weight 3.",
      "question": "Is the clock face circular and positioned in the center of the wooden frame?",

      "thinking_process": "The Roman numerals (I–XII) are the primary means of reading time and are uniquely placed in a clockwise sequence around the dial. Their **presence and correct order** are essential to the clock’s identity. While their style may change (e.g., etched instead of painted), their **positions and sequence** must be preserved. Losing them would make the clock unrecognizable. This is a **core functional and symbolic element**, hence weight 3.",
      "question": "Are the Roman numerals arranged in clockwise order from I to XII around the clock face?",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The pendulum is a defining feature of a grandfather-style wall clock. Its **position directly below the clock face**, suspended by two rods, is critical to the object’s mechanical and visual identity. Even if reshaped into a crystal ornament, its **spatial relationship** must remain. Changing this would break the logical structure of the clock. Hence, this is a **functional and structural element**, weight 3.",
      "question": "Does the pendulum hang directly below the clock face, supported by two vertical rods?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The fluted columns on either side of the clock frame are a distinctive architectural detail contributing to the clock’s ornate appearance. Their **vertical placement and symmetrical positioning** define the frame’s structure. While material may change, their **form and location** must remain to preserve the clock’s identity. This is a **key structural element**, weight 2.",
      "question": "Are there two fluted columns, one on each side of the clock face, extending from the top to the bottom of the frame?",
      "choices": [

      "thinking_process": "The top crest ornamentation is a unique decorative element that contributes to the clock’s aesthetic identity. It is located at the apex of the frame and has a distinct foliate design. Even if rendered in crystal, its **presence and position** must be preserved to maintain visual coherence. This is a **secondary but identifiable detail**, weight 2.",
      "question": "Is there a decorative crest with leaf-like carvings located at the top center of the clock frame?",

      "thinking_process": "The central medallion within the clock face is a prominent design feature, serving as a focal point. Its **circular shape and placement at the center of the face** are important for maintaining the visual balance and authenticity of the clock. Even if transformed into crystal, its **position and form** must remain. This is a **detail-level element**, but crucial for visual consistency, weight 1.",
      "question": "Is there a circular medallion located at the center of the clock face?",

      "thinking_process": "The bottom shelf and feet of the clock frame provide structural balance and are part of the clock’s architectural design. Their **presence and symmetrical placement** contribute to the overall form. While material may change, their **form and position** must remain. This is a **minor structural detail**, weight 1.",
      "question": "Are there two small rounded feet extending downward from the bottom corners of the clock frame?",
