      "thinking_process": "The elephant is the central subject of the image. Its presence and overall form (dark gray skin, large ears, long trunk) are essential for identification. Even if rendered in miniature style, the animal must retain its recognizable shape and position. Loss of the elephant would make the scene unrecognizable as a procession involving an elephant. This is a core identity element.",
      "question": "Is the elephant clearly visible and positioned centrally beneath the archway?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The rider’s location on the elephant’s back is critical for narrative and compositional integrity. The act of riding is central to the scene’s meaning. Changing this would break the functional relationship between rider and animal. The rider must remain seated atop the elephant, maintaining the original spatial arrangement.",
      "question": "Is the rider seated on the elephant’s back, directly above its spine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The archway with its distinctive scalloped arch and flanking columns defines the scene’s architectural frame. It is a key environmental feature that anchors the composition. Even if stylized, the structure must remain identifiable to preserve the setting.",
      "question": "Are the two carved pillars and the scalloped arch forming a gateway visible in the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The marigold garlands are culturally significant and visually dominant. They adorn both the rider and the elephant and are a defining feature of the ceremonial context. Their absence would remove a major symbolic and aesthetic component of the image.",
      "question": "Are orange marigold garlands draped over the elephant’s head, trunk, and body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The hanging tassels (one green, one orange) are specific decorative elements attached to the arch. They add cultural detail and symmetry. Their removal would reduce authenticity and visual balance. While not central to identity, they are important scene elements.",
      "question": "Are two hanging tassels (one green, one orange) visible from the arch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The rider’s face and posture (looking slightly to the right) provide narrative direction and engagement. While clothing may change, the facial orientation and gaze must remain consistent to preserve expression and intent.",
      "question": "Is the rider’s head turned slightly to the right side of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The marigold petals scattered on the ground reinforce the ceremonial atmosphere and connect to the garlands. Their presence adds continuity and thematic consistency. Though minor, they are part of the environmental detail that supports the scene.",
      "question": "Are marigold petals visible on the ground around the elephant’s feet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "thinking_process": "The background crowd provides context and scale. While their appearance may be stylized into courtly figures, their presence is necessary to convey a public procession. Removing them would isolate the main subject and disrupt narrative completeness.",
      "question": "Are people visible in the background, walking along the path?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q9",
      "thinking_process": "The dome-shaped buildings in the distance establish the architectural setting. They are part of the cultural and spatial context. Even if reimagined, their presence must be preserved to maintain the scene’s location and grandeur.",
      "question": "Are two dome-shaped structures visible in the background beyond the archway?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
