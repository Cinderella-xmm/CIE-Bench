      "thinking_process": "The capybara’s facial structure, particularly the broad snout and wide mouth with visible teeth, is a core identity feature. This distinguishes it from other rodents or animals. Even when transformed into a bronze sculpture, the shape of the nose, mouth, and surrounding facial contours must remain identical to maintain species recognition. Loss of this would result in misidentification. Therefore, this is a 3-point question.",
      "question": "Is the capybara’s snout shape — including the rounded nose, wide mouth, and visible teeth — preserved in the sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The white muzzle contrasting with the light brown fur is a distinctive visual marker of the capybara. Although the fur is transformed into engraved lines, the **relative area and shape** of the white muzzle must be preserved to maintain the correct facial pattern. This is a key identification feature and cannot be omitted without losing recognition. Thus, it is a 3-point question.",
      "question": "Is the white muzzle area, positioned centrally on the face and extending from the nose to the upper lip, preserved in the sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The whiskers are a defining sensory and aesthetic feature of the capybara. Their number, length, and radial spread from the snout are unique to the species. Even in engraved form, their **arrangement and density** must match the original to preserve realism and identity. This is a 2-point question because while not as critical as facial structure, it significantly affects visual fidelity.",
      "question": "Are the whiskers present and arranged in the same radial pattern from the snout as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The positioning of the sunglasses over the eyes is crucial for preserving the character’s appearance. Even though they are replaced with bronze-framed glass lenses, their **placement over the eyes** must remain unchanged to maintain the original look and expression. This is a functional alignment requirement. Hence, it is a 2-point question.",
      "question": "Are the glasses positioned directly over the eyes, with the frame aligned horizontally across the bridge of the nose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The sweater and shoulder straps are key accessories that define the character’s style. Their **position on the shoulders and torso** must remain consistent, even if rendered in bronze. Changing their placement would disrupt the visual logic of the outfit. This is a 1-point question because it’s a detail-level accessory, but still contributes to overall consistency.",
      "question": "Are the sweater and shoulder straps positioned on the shoulders and torso in the same way as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The head shape and proportions — especially the rounded head and short ears — are essential for identifying the capybara. Even with a helmet, the underlying head shape must match the original. This is a core anatomical feature and must be preserved. It is a 3-point question due to its role in species recognition.",
      "question": "Is the capybara’s head shape — rounded, broad, and proportionally large relative to the body — preserved in the sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The mouth is slightly open, showing teeth — a distinctive expression that adds character. This specific **mouth posture** must be preserved in the sculpture to maintain the original expression. While minor, it contributes to identity and emotion. This is a 1-point question as it’s a fine detail.",
      "question": "Is the mouth depicted as slightly open, revealing the teeth, in the same manner as the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
