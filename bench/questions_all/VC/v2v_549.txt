Description of reference image: The subject is a baseball player in action during a game, captured mid-swing with a bat. He is wearing a gray uniform with a black helmet and black gloves. Another player, presumably the pitcher, is seen in a white uniform with a blue cap, throwing the ball. The catcher and umpire are positioned behind home plate, with the catcher in protective gear and the umpire in black attire. The background shows a large stadium filled with spectators, creating a lively and dynamic sports scene.

### Step 1 - Allowed Changes List:

Thinking process: The instructions specify transforming the baseball player into a Funko Pop-style figure, changing the scene to an isometric view of a product box, and including a realistic depiction of the figure outside the box. Therefore, the player's form, the scene, and the background can be significantly altered. However, the player's iconic elements, such as his uniform, bat, helmet, and the baseball-related items, should be retained.

Allowed Changes List:
Specific element 1 that allows for changes: The player's physical form can be changed to a chibi-style Funko Pop figure.
Specific element 2 that allows for changes: The scene can be transformed into an isometric view of a product box.
Specific element 3 that allows for changes: The background can be replaced with a product showcase setting.

### Step 2 - Preservation Targets List:

Thinking process: Core recognition elements include the player's uniform, bat, helmet, and other baseball-related items. Functional/logical association elements involve the player holding the bat and wearing the helmet, as these are essential for the baseball theme. Remaining elements, such as the player's posture and the presence of the ball and glove, should also be retained for visual coherence.

Preservation Targets List:
(Element 1 that should be maintained): Player's uniform and helmet.
(Element 2 that should be maintained): Baseball bat and glove.
(Element 3 that should be maintained): Player's posture while holding the bat.
(Element 4 that should be maintained): Presence of the baseball.
(Element 5 that should be maintained): Catcher's protective gear.
