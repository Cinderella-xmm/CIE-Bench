**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is an elderly woman with long, wavy silver-gray hair, wearing round wire-rimmed glasses with a slight blue tint on the left lens. She is seated on a wooden park bench in a lush green garden setting, surrounded by trees, foliage, and pink flowering plants. She wears a dark olive-green button-up blouse with small white polka dots and a high collar, paired with maroon patterned pants. Her hands are visible—her right hand gently pointing at the text in an open book held in her lap, while her left hand supports the book. The book has aged yellowed pages and a black cover with a green bookmark. A colorful geometric patch (purple, orange, and blue triangle shapes) is attached to the right side of the bench backrest. The lighting is soft and natural, suggesting daylight filtered through tree canopies.

Thinking process:  
The editing instruction specifies creating a **three-panel card set**, indicating that the final output will be a composite artwork rather than a direct modification of the original photograph. The transformation involves:

- **Central panel**: Cartoonizing the act of turning book pages.
- **Left panel**: Morphing her hand into a tree branch.
- **Right panel**: Adding floral embellishments brightening the bench.
- **Material**: Soft pastel paper with textural leaf-patterned edges.

Key transformations:
- **Subject’s hand** → morphed into a tree branch (allowed change).
- **Book page-turning action** → cartoonized (allowed change).
- **Bench** → enhanced with floral embellishments (allowed change).
- **Overall medium** → changed to pastel paper with leaf-textured edges (allowed change).

However, the instruction does **not** state replacing or removing the **subject’s identity**, **facial features**, **clothing style**, **book presence**, **bench structure**, or **garden background** entirely—only transforming specific elements within them.

Therefore, changes allowed include:
- Visual stylization of the book interaction (cartoonization).
- Transformation of the hand into a tree branch (morphing).
- Addition of floral designs on the bench.
- Change of overall texture and color tone to match pastel paper with leaf patterns.

**Allowed Changes List:**
- The appearance of the hand (to become a tree branch)
- The depiction of the book page-turning motion (to be cartoonized)
- The visual design of the bench (to include floral embellishments)
- The overall surface texture and paper style (to soft pastel with leaf-patterned edges)
- The artistic rendering style (from realistic photo to illustrated panels)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements must remain intact because they define the subject's identity and context. For this image, the elderly woman is central, and her identity hinges on:

- **Facial features**: Her distinct facial structure, wrinkles, smile, and expression are key identifiers.
- **Hair**: Long, flowing silver-gray hair is a defining trait.
- **Glasses**: Round wire-rimmed glasses with subtle blue tint on one lens—this is a unique detail.
- **Clothing**: Olive-green dotted blouse and maroon patterned pants—these establish her appearance.
- **Book**: Presence of an open book with yellowed pages and green bookmark—essential for narrative context.
- **Bench**: Wooden structure with visible grain and the colorful patch—important for environmental grounding.
- **Background**: Garden with trees and pink flowers—establishes location and mood.

Functional/logical elements:
- The **act of reading** implies the book must remain present and readable (even if cartoonized), so its functional role as a reading object must be preserved.
- The **position of the book in her lap** and her **hand interacting with it** maintain logical continuity—though the hand may transform, the gesture must still imply reading.
- The **bench must remain a bench**, even if decorated; its function as seating must not be lost.

Non-modified element deduction:
After excluding allowed changes (hand, book animation, bench decoration, paper texture), all other visual details—such as her face, hair, clothing, glasses, and the original environment—are not mentioned for alteration and thus must be retained.

Preservation Targets List:  
- The elderly woman’s facial features (including wrinkles, eyes, nose, mouth, and smile)  
- Her long silver-gray hair  
- The round wire-rimmed glasses with blue-tinted left lens  
- The olive-green polka-dotted blouse with high collar and buttons  
- The maroon patterned pants  
- The open book with yellowed pages and green bookmark  
- The wooden bench with visible grain and the colorful geometric patch on the right side  
- The garden background with trees, green foliage, and pink flowers

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

Q1:  
Thinking process: The woman’s facial features—including her smile, wrinkles, eye shape, and position—are the core identifiers of her identity. If these are altered beyond recognition (e.g., exaggerated cartoon features), she would no longer be identifiable as the same person. This is a 3-point element because it defines the subject’s identity and emotional presence.  
Question: Is the elderly woman’s face, including her smile, wrinkles, and eye shape, clearly visible and unaltered in form?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The long silver-gray hair is a distinctive feature that contributes to her age and identity. Removing or changing its color, length, or flow would significantly alter her appearance. Since the instruction only allows transformation of the hand and book interaction, her hair must remain unchanged. This is a 3-point element due to its strong visual identity role.  
Question: Is the woman’s long, wavy silver-gray hair fully present and retaining its original flow and color?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The round wire-rimmed glasses with the blue-tinted left lens are unique accessories that distinguish her appearance. Even in a stylized version, their shape and color should be preserved to maintain recognition. Altering them would break visual consistency. This is a 2-point element as it is a key accessory affecting identity.  
Question: Are the round wire-rimmed glasses with a blue-tinted left lens still present and correctly shaped?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The olive-green blouse with white polka dots and high collar is a defining part of her attire. Changing its color, pattern, or style would make her look different. Since no instruction mentions altering clothing, it must be preserved. This is a 2-point element due to its role in identifying her outfit.  
Question: Is the olive-green blouse with small white polka dots and a high collar still visible and unchanged?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The open book with yellowed pages and a green bookmark is central to the scene’s narrative. Although the page-turning motion may be cartoonized, the book itself must remain recognizable. Its presence is essential to the theme of reading. This is a 2-point element as it supports the functional logic of the scene.  
Question: Is the open book with yellowed pages and a green bookmark still present in her lap?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The wooden bench with visible grain and the colorful geometric patch (purple, orange, blue triangles) is a key environmental anchor. While floral embellishments may be added, the bench structure and patch must remain. Losing the patch would remove a unique detail. This is a 1-point element as it is a minor but identifiable feature.  
Question: Is the wooden bench with visible wood grain and the colorful triangular patch on the right side still present?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The garden background with green foliage and pink flowers establishes the setting. While floral embellishments may be added, the original flora must remain visible to preserve context. This is a 1-point element as it supports environmental coherence.  
Question: Are the green trees, foliage, and pink flowers in the background still visible and unchanged in placement?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q8:  
Thinking process: The maroon patterned pants are part of her full outfit. Since no instruction mentions altering clothing, they must remain. Their pattern and color help complete her visual identity. This is a 1-point element as a secondary detail.  
Question: Are the maroon patterned pants still visible and unchanged in color and texture?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1
