      "thinking_process": "The open book is the central subject of the composition, and its physical presence is essential to the scene’s identity. Even if the pages transform into mechanical schematics, the book must remain open and centered on the desk. Losing this would fundamentally alter the scene’s purpose and narrative. Thus, the presence and open state of the book are core identity features, warranting a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the book physically present and open on the wooden desk?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The brass desk lamp is a key object whose form and function define the scene’s lighting and aesthetic. Although cogs may be added, the lamp must retain its original shape and position to maintain continuity. Its role as the light source is critical. If the lamp were removed or replaced, the scene’s logic collapses. Hence, its presence and structural integrity are core, earning a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the ornate brass desk lamp positioned on the left side of the desk, with its arm extended toward the book?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The wooden desk provides the foundational surface and anchors the entire composition. Its texture and color contribute to the vintage feel. Even with steampunk additions, the desk must remain wooden and in the same position. Altering its material or removing it would destroy the scene’s coherence. It is a key structural element, thus worth 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the desk made of wood with visible grain texture and located beneath all objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The stack of two books on the right and the single closed book on the left are compositional balancing elements. Their presence maintains symmetry and realism. While their covers may gain metallic accents, their positions and forms must remain. Removing them would disrupt the scene’s balance. They are important but not central, hence a weight of 2 points.",
      "question": "Are there two stacked books on the right side of the desk and one small closed book on the left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The light beam from the lamp must still illuminate the open book, preserving the functional relationship between the lamp and the book. This is a logical necessity — without this, the scene loses its purpose. The direction and origin of the light must remain consistent. This is a critical functional element, hence 3 points.",
      "question": "Does the lamp emit a focused beam of light that falls directly onto the open book?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The warm, vintage leather-and-brass color palette is explicitly required to be maintained. This includes the golden hues of the lamp, the brown tones of the book covers and desk, and the deep blue of the wall. Even with steampunk additions, these colors must not shift drastically. Preserving this palette ensures stylistic consistency. It is a key directive, thus 3 points.",
      "question": "Are the dominant colors in the scene warm browns, golds, and deep blues, consistent with a vintage leather-and-brass aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The background wall, though its pattern will change to rivets, must remain dark teal and textured. The wall’s presence and color are essential for depth and mood. Even if the floral pattern is replaced, the wall’s base color and surface must be preserved. This is a secondary detail but contributes to visual coherence, hence 1 point.",
      "question": "Is the wall behind the desk dark teal in color with a textured surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
