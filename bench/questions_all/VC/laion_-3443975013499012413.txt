Description of reference image: The subject is a square wooden carving featuring a detailed relief of a fish, specifically resembling a catfish or similar bottom-dwelling species. The fish is depicted in a coiled, circular posture, with its head pointing toward the upper right and tail curving beneath it, forming an almost complete loop. The carving exhibits fine textural details such as scales, gills, fins, and whiskers (barbels), all rendered through precise incisions and depth variations in the wood. The wood itself has a warm brown tone with visible grain patterns running vertically across the surface, indicating natural wood texture. The piece stands upright on a textured gray fabric surface, with a white brick-patterned wall in the background. The lighting is even, casting soft shadows that emphasize the three-dimensional quality of the carving.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions to determine what can be changed. The instruction explicitly states to "transform the wooden carving into a crystalline sculpture of a fish," which means the material (wood → crystal) and visual properties (matte wood → glossy transparent blue/teal crystals) are allowed to change. It also specifies replacing the scene with a "minimalist white gallery space on a sleek, mirrored pedestal," meaning the background and display environment are fully replaceable. However, the core form and structure of the fish—its shape, pose, and anatomical features—are not mentioned as being altered, implying they must remain consistent. Additionally, since no mention is made of changing the fish’s orientation, coiled posture, or specific morphological traits like barbels or fin shapes, these should be preserved. The instruction focuses on transformation of material and setting, not reimagining the subject’s identity or form.

Allowed Changes List:
- Material of the carving (wood → transparent blue and teal crystals)
- Surface texture (matte wood → glossy, faceted crystal)
- Coloration (warm brown → translucent blue/teal hues)
- Background environment (white brick wall and gray fabric → minimalist white gallery space)
- Display surface (gray fabric → mirrored pedestal)
- Lighting effects (soft ambient light → reflective, gallery-style illumination)

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements: The fish's **coiled circular posture** and **distinctive anatomical features** (such as barbels, dorsal fin shape, scale pattern, and curved tail) are essential for identifying the subject as a specific type of fish (likely a catfish). These features define the subject’s identity and artistic intent. Even if transformed into crystal, the overall silhouette and key morphological traits must remain unchanged to preserve recognition. Changing the pose or removing key features would alter the subject's identity.

Functional/logical association elements: The **orientation and spatial relationship** of the fish within the square frame (head at top-right, body looping downward) establishes compositional balance and narrative flow. This layout is critical to how the viewer interprets the design. Since the instruction does not specify altering this arrangement, it must be preserved for logical consistency.

Non-modified element deduction: After excluding changes to material, color, texture, and background, the remaining structural components—the **shape of the fish**, **position of fins**, **presence of barbels**, **scale pattern**, and **overall coiled form**—must be retained. These are not mentioned in the change list and are visually distinct enough to serve as anchors for identification.

Preservation Targets List:
- The coiled circular posture of the fish
- The presence of barbels (whiskers) near the mouth
- The shape and placement of the dorsal and pectoral fins
- The scale pattern along the body
- The tail curving under the body to complete the loop

    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The coiled circular posture is the defining compositional feature of the carving. It creates a continuous, flowing form that distinguishes this piece from other fish carvings. If this looped structure is broken or altered, the work loses its unique visual identity. This is a core structural element directly tied to the subject’s recognition.
    Question: Is the fish depicted in a continuous, coiled circular posture with its head pointing toward the upper right and tail curving beneath it?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The barbels (whiskers) are iconic features of catfish and are clearly carved near the mouth in the original. Their presence is crucial for identifying the species and maintaining biological accuracy in the representation. Removing them would misrepresent the subject.
    Question: Are there three distinct barbels extending from the lower jaw of the fish?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The dorsal fin is a prominent feature positioned along the back of the fish and contributes to its overall silhouette. Its shape and placement are consistent with the anatomy of a catfish and help define the profile. Altering it would affect the realism and recognizability of the fish.
    Question: Is the dorsal fin located along the upper back of the fish and shaped with a serrated edge?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The scale pattern is intricately carved along the body and is a key detail that adds texture and realism. While the material may change, the pattern’s layout and directionality should be preserved to maintain the visual fidelity of the original design.
    Question: Are the scales arranged in overlapping rows along the body of the fish, running from head to tail?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The tail curves under the body to complete the circular loop, forming a closed shape. This specific positioning is part of the design’s symmetry and balance. Any deviation would disrupt the intended composition.
    Question: Does the tail of the fish curve underneath the body and connect near the head, completing a nearly full circle?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The pectoral fins are visible on the sides of the fish and contribute to its three-dimensional appearance. Their position and shape are consistent with the anatomy of the species and should be retained to preserve the integrity of the figure.
    Question: Are there two pectoral fins visible on the side of the fish, one near the head and one further back?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}
{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The square wooden plaque serves as the base for the carving and frames the design. Although the material may change, the overall rectangular shape and framing function should remain to preserve the context of the artwork.
    Question: Is the fish carving contained within a square-shaped panel with rounded corners?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
