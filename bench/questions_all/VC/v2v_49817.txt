### Step 1 - Description of Reference Image and Allowed Changes List:

**Description of Reference Image:**  
The image features three individuals in a studio-like setting with large windows in the background. On the left, a person wearing a wide-brimmed hat, sunglasses, and a dark outfit is operating a pencil sharpener. In the center, a woman with long hair stands in the background, wearing a sleeveless top. On the right, a muscular man with an afro hairstyle and intricate tattoos on his arm is seated, observing the scene. The table in the foreground has scattered papers and pencils. The lighting is soft, and the overall tone is monochromatic.

**Thinking Process:**  
The editing instructions specify transforming the image into an Ancient Egyptian relief carving. This involves changing the artistic style, color palette, and some postures. However, certain elements like the interaction between the subjects and their relative positions must be retained.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
1. Artistic style transformation to Ancient Egyptian relief carving.
2. Color palette change to muted earth tones.
3. Posture adjustment to traditional profile views.
4. Background transformation to a weathered limestone slab appearance.

### Step 2 - Determination of Elements That Should Remain Unchanged:

**Thinking Process:**  
Core recognition elements include the sharpener as a central object, the interaction between the individuals, and their relative positions. Functional elements like the sharpener's purpose and the man's observation stance must be preserved. Remaining elements like the window lattice and scattered papers contribute to visual coherence.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
1. The presence and function of the pencil sharpener.
2. The interaction and relative positioning of the three individuals.
3. The general studio setting with large windows.
4. The scattered papers and pencils on the table.
