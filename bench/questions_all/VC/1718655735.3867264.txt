**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a fairy-like figure in profile, facing right, with her head slightly turned toward the viewer. She wears an elaborate metallic mask that covers the upper half of her face, featuring sharp angular extensions resembling stylized horns or wings, intricately engraved with filigree patterns. The mask extends over her forehead and wraps around her cheekbone, leaving only her lower face visible—her lips are painted red, and her eyes are closed or partially obscured by shadow. Her hair is dark and pulled back, adorned with dangling earrings made of small metallic beads. She has large, translucent butterfly wings attached to her back, which are brownish-orange in color with a veined texture mimicking real insect wings, showing mottled patterns of amber, rust, and dark brown, resembling dried leaves or aged parchment. Her outfit is a form-fitting, sleeveless dress made of dark, textured fabric with lace-like embroidery and metallic threadwork, forming ornate floral and organic motifs across the torso and shoulders. The dress appears semi-transparent in areas, revealing subtle contours beneath. A thin cord or wire trails from the base of her wing, suggesting mechanical or magical attachment. The background consists of a cloudy sky with soft gray-blue tones, giving a dramatic yet ethereal atmosphere.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction states: *"Transform the fairy into a miniature figure inside a delicate glass dome, standing on a polished wooden base. Incorporate shimmering, metallic butterfly wings and intricate fabric textures on the outfit. Surround her with translucent floating petals and small swirling leaves, emphasizing her ethereal nature in a soft blue gradient backdrop for a whimsical and magical display."*

Key transformations specified:
- **Subject transformation**: The fairy becomes a *miniature figure* → size change allowed.
- **New container/environment**: Placed *inside a delicate glass dome* → scene change allowed.
- **Base**: Standing on a *polished wooden base* → new structural element added; original base not mentioned → can be changed.
- **Wings**: “Incorporate shimmering, metallic butterfly wings” → this suggests modification to existing wings (material/texture), but does not explicitly remove or replace them → allows enhancement or retexturing.
- **Outfit**: “Intricate fabric textures on the outfit” → implies preservation of outfit structure but possible enhancement of texture detail → existing textile pattern may be preserved or enhanced.
- **Surroundings**: Add *translucent floating petals*, *swirling leaves*, and *soft blue gradient backdrop* → these are entirely new elements; original background (cloudy sky) is to be replaced.
- **Overall tone**: Emphasize "ethereal nature" and "whimsical and magical display" → aesthetic shift allowed, but core identity must remain.

From this, we infer:
- The **fairy’s identity** (as a masked, winged figure) must remain intact.
- The **mask**, **wing structure**, **outfit silhouette**, and **overall posture** are likely foundational to identity and thus should not be fundamentally altered unless explicitly permitted.
- **Color changes** to wings (e.g., adding shimmer/metallic sheen) are allowed under "shimmering, metallic" description.
- **Texture enhancements** to clothing are allowed as long as they do not alter the fundamental design.
- The **original background (cloudy sky)** is to be replaced with a blue gradient — so it is **not required to retain**.
- The **glass dome and wooden base** are new constructs — not part of original image → allowed to add.
- **Floating petals and leaves** are new additions → allowed.

Thus, the following elements are **allowed to change**:

**Allowed Changes List:**
- Size of the subject (transformed into miniature)
- Background (replaced with soft blue gradient)
- Presence of glass dome
- Presence of wooden base
- Addition of floating petals and swirling leaves
- Wing material/textural appearance (to become shimmering, metallic)
- Outfit texture details (enhanced intricacy)
- Lighting and overall ambiance (for whimsical effect)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
We now apply exclusion logic based on the above allowed changes.

**Core recognition elements:**  
The fairy is defined by several key visual features:
- The **metallic mask** with its **distinctive angular shape and filigree engraving** — this is a unique identifier, not just decorative. It defines her as a fantasy figure with cultural or symbolic significance (possibly inspired by Venetian or tribal masks). Changing its form would make her unrecognizable.
- The **butterfly wings' structure and venation pattern** — though their material may be modified (to shimmering metal), the **shape and vein layout** must remain consistent to preserve identity as a winged fairy.
- The **outfit's silhouette and ornamentation style** — the halter-neck cut, high waist, and lace-like embroidery are distinctive and tied to the character’s design. While texture can be enhanced, the **overall shape and placement of decorative motifs** must be preserved.
- The **subject’s pose and profile orientation** — she is shown in side profile, looking right, with a poised, elegant stance. This posture contributes to her identity and narrative presence.
- The **presence of the thin wire/cord extending from the wing base** — this is a specific detail suggesting mechanical or magical attachment; if removed, it alters the implied function or origin of the wings.

**Functional/logical association elements:**  
- The **connection between wings and body via the wire** suggests a functional link — possibly mechanical or magical — so altering or removing it could disrupt the logical coherence of the design.
- The **mask’s coverage of the upper face** and its integration with the hairline and ear area must remain to maintain facial identity and symmetry.

**Non-modified element deduction:**  
After excluding allowed changes, the following must remain:
- The **exact shape of the mask** (especially the pointed crest and eye-covering portion)
- The **vein structure of the wings** (even if made metallic)
- The **position and form of the earrings** (dangling bead style)
- The **contour of the dress**, including the armhole cut and waist cinch
- The **closed-eye expression** and **red lips** — facial features critical to emotional tone
- The **relative positioning of the wings to the body** (attached at shoulder level, fanned out behind)

These are not mentioned as changeable, and changing them would compromise identity or coherence.

**Preservation Targets List:**
- The angular, filigree-patterned metallic mask covering the upper face
- The large, veined butterfly wings with mottled brown-orange coloring
- The thin wire trailing from the base of the wing
- The form-fitting dress with lace-like embroidery and halter neckline
- The subject’s side profile pose with head turned slightly toward the viewer
- The dangling beaded earrings
- The closed eyes and red lips
- The general silhouette and proportion of the figure

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The metallic mask with its distinct angular shape and filigree engraving is the primary identifier of the fairy’s identity. Its unique design, especially the upward-pointing crest and eye-covering section, is essential for recognizing her as a fantasy figure. If the mask’s shape is altered, such as becoming rounded or simplified, it would no longer be recognizable as the same character. Therefore, the presence and form of the mask are core identity features, warranting a weight of 3 points.
    Question: Does the edited image retain the angular, filigree-patterned metallic mask covering the upper face, including the prominent crest and eye-covering section?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The wings’ vein structure and overall shape are critical to identifying the subject as a fairy with butterfly-like wings. Although the instructions allow for a metallic or shimmering texture, the underlying structure—specifically the branching veins and mottled brown-orange coloration—must remain to preserve the original visual identity. Altering the wing shape or vein pattern would fundamentally change the character’s appearance. This is a core identity feature, hence a weight of 3 points.
    Question: Are the butterfly wings retained with their original veined structure and mottled brown-orange coloration, even if rendered with a metallic or shimmering surface?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The thin wire or cord extending from the base of the wing is a specific detail that suggests mechanical or magical attachment. It is a non-redundant feature that contributes to the narrative logic of the wings. Removing or replacing it would disrupt the functional coherence of the design. Since it is not mentioned as changeable, it must be preserved. This is a functional detail, important for maintaining logical consistency, so it receives a weight of 2 points.
    Question: Is the thin wire or cord extending from the base of the left wing still present and connected to the wing structure?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The form-fitting dress with its halter neckline, lace-like embroidery, and high waistline defines the character’s silhouette and style. While texture may be enhanced, the outline and placement of decorative patterns must remain consistent to maintain visual continuity. This is a key accessory and design element, crucial for identification. Its alteration would affect recognition, making it a 2-point element.
    Question: Does the outfit retain the halter-neck silhouette with lace-like embroidery along the torso and arms, including the high waist and fitted form?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The subject’s pose—side profile with head slightly turned toward the viewer—is integral to her presentation and emotional expression. This posture contributes to the elegance and mystery of the character. Changing it would alter the narrative framing. Though not the most defining feature, it is a key compositional element that affects visual coherence. Thus, it is assigned 2 points.
    Question: Is the fairy depicted in a side profile pose, with her head slightly turned toward the viewer and her gaze directed forward?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The dangling beaded earrings are a minor but distinctive detail that complements the mask and adds to the character’s ornamental style. They are visually unique and contribute to the overall aesthetic. While not central to identity, their absence would reduce visual fidelity and coherence. Hence, they are a detail-level element, assigned 1 point.
    Question: Are the dangling beaded earrings still visible on the subject’s ears?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}
{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The closed eyes and red lips are facial features that define the subject’s serene and mysterious expression. These are not merely decorative but convey emotion and identity. Altering them (e.g., opening the eyes or changing lip color) would significantly affect the character’s mood and recognition. As key facial identifiers, they are essential and thus receive a weight of 2 points.
    Question: Are the subject’s eyes closed and her lips painted red, matching the original appearance?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
