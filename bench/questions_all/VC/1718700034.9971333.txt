Description of reference image: The subject is a young girl with long, wavy blonde hair that falls over her shoulders, parted slightly off-center. She has fair skin, large blue eyes, and a calm, neutral facial expression with soft natural lighting highlighting her features. Her wings are large, white, and feathered, extending symmetrically from her back with a luminous glow emanating from the tips and edges, suggesting an ethereal or angelic quality. The wings have a layered structure with individual feathers clearly defined, and their positioning is wide and upward-sweeping, creating a sense of grace and elevation. She wears a plain, short-sleeved white t-shirt made of a smooth, matte fabric, fitting loosely around her torso. The background is dimly lit and indistinct, featuring warm ambient light sources such as glowing orbs or lamps in the upper left, and dark wooden architectural elements like columns or doorways, contributing to a mystical or sacred atmosphere. The overall composition centers on the figure, with soft focus on the background to emphasize her presence.

Thinking process:  
First, analyze the editing instructions word by word:  
- "Replace the wings with large crystal shards in shades of opal and white" → This explicitly changes the **form and material** of the wings; thus, the original feathered wing structure is no longer required.  
- "Shift the hair into golden leafy strands, interwoven like a crown" → This alters both **texture and color** of the hair; therefore, the original wavy blonde hair can be modified.  
- "Convert the shirt into smooth velvet, retaining the white tone" → The **material** of the shirt changes (from plain cotton-like to velvet), but the **color (white)** must remain. Thus, the white color of the shirt is preserved, but its texture is allowed to change.  
- "Set against a minimalist backdrop of a deep gray wall" → This replaces the entire background environment; hence, the original background (with warm lights and wooden structures) is not required to be retained.

Allowed Changes List:  
- Wings: form, texture, material (feathered → crystalline)  
- Hair: color, texture, style (blonde wavy → golden leafy crown)  
- Shirt: fabric texture (plain → velvet), but color (white) remains  
- Background: entire scene replaced (dimly lit interior with warm lights and wood → deep gray wall)

Step 2– Determine the elements that should remain unchanged  
Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements:  
The subject is a young girl with distinct human features—specifically, her **face**, including **facial structure**, **eye shape and color**, **nose**, **lips**, and **skin tone**—are critical for identity preservation. These are not mentioned in the instructions for modification, so they must remain unchanged. Additionally, the **overall posture** (standing upright, facing forward, arms at sides) is implied by the original image and not altered in the instruction, so it should be preserved.  

Functional/logical association elements:  
There are no functional interactions (e.g., holding an object, interacting with environment), but the **spatial relationship** between the subject and the wings (attached to back, symmetrical, elevated) is logical and structural. While the wings themselves change, the **attachment point** (shoulder/back area) and **symmetry** may still need to be preserved in terms of spatial logic even if form changes. However, since the instruction allows full replacement of wings, the **attachment location** is not a core feature unless specified. But because wings are central to the angelic identity, and the new crystals must logically extend from the same position, the **position of the wings' base** (on the back near shoulders) should be retained for coherence.  

Non-modified element deduction:  
After excluding all allowed changes:  
- Hair: changed → not retained  
- Wings: changed → not retained  
- Shirt material: changed → only color retained  
- Background: changed → not retained  

What remains:  
- Facial features (eyes, nose, mouth, skin tone)  
- Overall body shape and posture (upright stance, frontal view)  
- Color of shirt (white)  
- Skin tone and facial proportions  
- Position of limbs (arms down, hands not visible)  

These are not mentioned for change and are essential for maintaining the identity of the subject as a child with specific physical traits. Even though the wings and hair are transformed, the **core human identity** must be preserved to avoid losing recognition of the character.

Preservation Targets List:  
- Facial features (eyes, nose, mouth, skin tone)  
- Body posture (upright, frontal, arms at sides)  
- White color of the shirt  
- Proportions and symmetry of the face and body  
- Limb positioning (arms down, no visible hands)  

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The eyes are a key identifying feature of the subject in the original image—specifically, their large size, blue color, and direct gaze toward the viewer. These contribute to the emotional and identity recognition of the figure. If the eye color or shape were altered, the identity of the character would be compromised, especially given the emphasis on facial expression. Since the editing instruction does not mention changing the eyes, this is a core visual element that must be preserved. It is not merely a detail but a defining trait of the subject’s appearance.
    Question: Are the eyes blue and positioned symmetrically in the face, looking directly forward?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The nose is a central facial landmark that contributes to the anatomical identity of the subject. Its shape—small, rounded, and proportionate to the face—is consistent with the child's age and facial structure. Altering its shape or position would disrupt facial harmony and identity. As no instruction specifies modification, it must remain unchanged. This is a core feature necessary for facial recognition.
    Question: Is the nose small, rounded, and centrally located on the face, aligned with the eyes and mouth?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The mouth is another key facial identifier, with a soft, closed expression and natural lip shape. Its position below the nose and symmetry relative to the face are essential for maintaining the subject’s serene demeanor. Since the instruction does not alter facial features, the mouth must remain as depicted. This contributes to the emotional tone and identity of the figure.
    Question: Is the mouth closed, with natural lips forming a gentle, neutral line centered beneath the nose?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The shirt’s color is explicitly stated to be retained ("retaining the white tone"). Although the material changes from plain to velvet, the color must remain white. This is a critical directive in the instruction, making the white color a preserved attribute. Changing it would violate the explicit condition, even if texture changes.
    Question: Is the shirt white in color?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The posture—standing upright, facing forward, arms at sides—is fundamental to the composition and identity of the figure. It establishes the subject’s orientation and presence. The instruction does not suggest any change in pose, so this spatial arrangement must be preserved. Even with wing transformation, the body’s orientation remains central to consistency.
    Question: Is the subject standing upright with arms relaxed at her sides and facing directly forward?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The skin tone is a consistent visual trait across the face and neck, appearing fair and evenly lit. This contributes to the subject’s identity and realism. Since no instruction mentions altering skin tone, and it is not part of the described modifications, it must be preserved. Loss of this would affect racial and age identification.
    Question: Is the skin tone consistently fair and unblemished across the face and neck?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The symmetry of the face—alignment of eyes, eyebrows, nose, and mouth—is crucial for visual balance and identity. Asymmetric changes could misrepresent the subject. The original image shows balanced facial features, and since no modification is instructed, symmetry must be maintained. This supports accurate representation.
    Question: Are the facial features symmetrically aligned along the vertical midline of the face?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
