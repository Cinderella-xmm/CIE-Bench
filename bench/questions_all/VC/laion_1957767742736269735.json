      "thinking_process": "The white star with \"4\" is a distinctive U.S. military insignia used for identification and unit designation. It is a core recognition feature of this specific tank variant. If removed or altered beyond recognition, the tank loses its historical and operational identity. This is a fixed marker, and its presence and position are essential for authenticity.",
      "question": "Is the white star with the number \"4\" visible on the turret of the tank?",

      "thinking_process": "The numbers \"31 64A\" and \"A-14\" are unit and model identifiers painted on the hull. They are functional markings that provide historical context and distinguish this tank from others. Their removal or alteration would compromise the authenticity of the vehicle representation.",
      "question": "Are the markings \"31 64A\" and \"A-14\" visible on the lower sides of the tank’s hull?",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The main gun barrel pointing forward is a defining structural feature of the tank. Its orientation determines the tank’s combat role and directionality. Any deviation would misrepresent the vehicle’s functionality and appearance.",
      "question": "Is the main gun barrel oriented straight forward from the turret?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The museum sign contains critical information about the site’s purpose and branding. The text, illustration, and URL are essential for identifying the location and intent of the display. Altering or removing any of these elements would break the informational integrity of the scene.",
      "question": "Is the sign reading \"FUTURE HOME OF THE NATIONAL ARMOR & CAVALRY MUSEUM\" with the cavalry rider illustration and the website \"www.armorcavalrymuseum.org\" visible and legible?",
      "choices": [

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The tiger decal, though to be redesigned in LEGO form, is a key visual symbol associated with the tank’s unit identity. Its presence on the front hull is essential for continuity, even if stylized. The location and concept must be preserved, even if the artistic execution changes.",
      "question": "Is there a tiger motif present on the front hull of the tank, located within the blue-and-white checkered area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The tank is positioned on the left side of the image, with the sign on the right. This spatial arrangement is crucial for scene comprehension and visual balance. Reversing or altering this layout would disrupt the intended presentation.",
      "question": "Is the tank positioned to the left of the museum sign?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The tank is front-facing, which is standard for display purposes and allows full visibility of its features. A change in orientation (e.g., side view) would fundamentally alter the viewer’s perception and the display’s intent.",
      "question": "Is the tank facing directly toward the camera (front-facing)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q8",
      "thinking_process": "The turret shape and size are characteristic of the M4 Sherman tank. Altering its form (e.g., making it blocky or rounded) would make it unrecognizable as a Sherman. The silhouette must be preserved for accurate representation.",
      "question": "Does the turret have a distinct cylindrical shape with a dome-like top and a single gun barrel protruding from the front?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
