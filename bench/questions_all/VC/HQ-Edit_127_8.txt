**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a knight in full silver armor, standing in profile facing right, wearing a golden crown with pointed spires and a long red velvet cloak with gold trim that drapes behind him. He holds a longsword in his right hand, resting it on the ground. The knight stands before a large stone gatehouse with crenellated battlements, featuring two arched niches with relief sculptures of armored figures—one male and one female—on either side of the central archway. The gate itself is wooden with vertical slats and spiked tops, slightly ajar, revealing a bright, glowing light from beyond, suggesting sunrise or sunset. Above the gate, atop the battlement, stands a small armored figure holding a shield and a red banner with a golden emblem fluttering in the wind. The sky is dramatic, filled with dark clouds and warm golden-orange hues near the horizon, casting long shadows across the grassy terrain. The overall composition emphasizes symmetry, grandeur, and medieval fantasy aesthetics.

**Thinking process:**  
First, parse the editing instruction word by word to determine what changes are permitted:

- *"Transform the castle scene into a detailed 3D diorama within a glass orb"* → The entire scene is to be recontextualized as a miniature enclosed in a transparent sphere. This implies a **complete change in presentation format**, but not necessarily the content.
- *"Minify stone textures for authenticity"* → The stone textures are to be scaled down (minified), meaning their size and scale are altered, but **texture detail must still reflect original material**.
- *"Rendering the armor-clad knight and gates in antique bronze finish"* → The **material finish** of the knight and gates is changed from silver/steel and stone to **antique bronze**, so **color and metallic sheen** are modified.
- *"Place miniature heraldic flags fluttering atop battlements"* → New elements (flags) are added; these were not present in the original unless the red banner counts as such — but this instruction suggests **additional banners**.
- *"Tiny turrets and crenellated walls encircling the orb's base"* → Additional architectural elements are introduced around the base of the orb; **not present originally**.
- *"Embed golden rays sculpted into the glass to mimic a warm, rising sun behind the fortress"* → A new visual effect (golden rays inside glass) is added; this alters lighting source representation.

Now identify which **elements can be changed**:

- The **form of the scene**: From open landscape to enclosed glass orb → allowed change.
- The **scale of textures**: Stone textures minified → allowed.
- The **material finish** of knight and gate: Changed to antique bronze → allowed.
- The **addition of new elements**: Heraldic flags, tiny turrets, golden rays → allowed.
- The **lighting and framing**: Glass orb with internal rays → allowed.

However, the instruction does **not** say:
- To remove or alter the **knight’s posture**, **crown**, **cloak**, or **sword**
- To remove the **gate structure**, **relief sculptures**, or **central archway**
- To change the **position of the knight relative to the gate**
- To eliminate the **red banner** or **figure atop the battlement**

Therefore, while the **medium**, **material**, and **surroundings** may change, **core visual identity features** of the subject and key architectural elements must remain recognizable.

---

**Allowed Changes List:**
- The overall scene environment (from open field to glass orb)
- Scale of stone textures
- Material finish of knight and gate (silver/stone → antique bronze)
- Addition of heraldic flags, turrets, and golden rays
- Lighting effects (sunrise simulation via embedded rays)
- Presence of glass orb enclosure

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
Now apply exclusion logic to determine what **must be preserved** based on:

1. **Core recognition elements**:
   - The knight’s **crown** is iconic — its shape (spiked, regal) and position (on head) are essential for identifying him as a royal figure.
   - The **red cloak with gold trim** is distinctive — color and drape pattern help distinguish him from other knights.
   - The **longsword held in right hand** is functional and symbolic — its presence and orientation define the pose.
   - The **arched gate with flanking reliefs** is central to the composition — its structural form, including the **two niches with figures**, defines the setting.
   - The **figure atop the battlement holding a red banner** is a key narrative element — even if miniaturized, it must remain.

2. **Functional/logical association elements**:
   - The **knight’s stance** (side profile, sword grounded) is tied to the **gate’s openness** — he appears to guard or stand at the threshold. This spatial relationship must be preserved even if scaled down.
   - The **position of the knight relative to the gate** (in front, centered) maintains narrative logic — altering this would break the intended symbolism.

3. **Non-modified element deduction**:
   - The **shape and number of reliefs** (two, one male, one female) must remain.
   - The **red banner** atop the battlement must persist, even if material changes.
   - The **presence of the knight’s crown** cannot be removed — it’s core to his identity.
   - The **cloak’s flow and length** should be retained — though texture may shift, its silhouette must remain.

Even though the material changes to bronze, the **original forms** (armor plates, helmet shape, crown spikes, cloak drape) must stay intact.

Thus, despite the transformation into a diorama, **the identity-defining shapes and positions** must survive.

**Preservation Targets List:**
- The knight’s crown with multiple pointed spires
- The red velvet cloak with gold trim flowing behind the knight
- The longsword held in the knight’s right hand, touching the ground
- The central arched gate with crenellated top and two flanking relief sculptures
- The armored figure atop the battlement holding a red banner
- The knight’s side profile stance in front of the gate
- The presence and position of the two relief figures (male and female) in arched niches
- The red banner with golden emblem (if visible)

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The crown is a core identity feature of the knight — its spiked design and placement on the head are critical for recognizing him as royalty. If lost or replaced, the character loses his royal status. It is not mentioned in the instructions to be removed or altered, only the material finish of the armor is changed, so the crown's form must remain.
    Question: Is the knight wearing a crown with multiple pointed spires on his head?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The red cloak with gold trim is a distinctive accessory that contributes to the knight’s noble appearance. Its color and drape are unique identifiers in the original image. Although material might change to bronze, the cloak's presence and shape must remain consistent for visual coherence.
    Question: Is there a long red cloak with gold trim draped over the knight’s left shoulder and trailing behind him?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The longsword held in the knight’s right hand is both a functional and symbolic element. Its position — touching the ground — defines the knight’s stance and readiness. Changing its orientation or removing it would alter the narrative and pose integrity.
    Question: Is the knight holding a longsword in his right hand, resting it on the ground?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The central arched gate with crenellated top and two flanking relief sculptures is the architectural centerpiece. The presence of two niches with distinct figures (male and female) is a key compositional feature. Even if scaled, their form and positioning must remain unchanged to preserve the scene’s identity.
    Question: Are there two arched niches on either side of the central gate, each containing a relief sculpture of an armored figure?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The figure atop the battlement holding a red banner is a narrative anchor — it adds depth and context to the scene. Its presence and action (holding flag) are important details. While the banner’s color may be preserved in hue, the figure’s posture and location must remain.
    Question: Is there an armored figure standing atop the battlement, holding a red banner with a golden emblem?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The knight’s stance — side profile, facing right, with body angled toward the gate — is crucial for spatial storytelling. This pose establishes his role as guardian. Even in a diorama, this orientation must be preserved to maintain narrative consistency.
    Question: Is the knight positioned in a side profile view, facing to the right of the image?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The red banner with a golden emblem is a specific heraldic detail. Its color and emblem are part of the visual signature of the scene. Though the instructions mention adding more flags, they do not specify replacing this one. Thus, the original banner must remain.
    Question: Is there a red banner with a golden emblem flying atop the battlement?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
