**Step 1 – Analyze the Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a two-story elevated stilt house constructed primarily from bamboo and wood, situated in a lush tropical mountainous region. The structure features a steeply pitched thatched roof made of dried straw or palm leaves, with visible wooden beams forming an X-shaped cross at the apex. The walls are composed of woven bamboo panels arranged in geometric lattice patterns, with dark-framed windows and glass panes. A large satellite dish is mounted on the right side of the upper level, extending outward on a metal pole. The house is supported by thick vertical wooden stilts rising from the ground, which also support a lower open-air platform. A winding concrete path leads up to the house, bordered by greenery including banana plants and flowering shrubs with bright orange blossoms. In the foreground, a small child sits near a water container beside the path. To the left, a neighboring building with a corrugated metal roof is partially visible. The sky is partly cloudy with blue tones, suggesting early morning or late afternoon light. The surrounding landscape includes dense jungle-covered hills fading into mist.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction explicitly transforms the house into a mythic treehouse creature. This means the *form* of the house is to be fundamentally altered—its structural components are reimagined as organic parts (legs, branches, eye). However, certain elements are not mentioned for transformation and thus may be assumed to remain contextually relevant unless contradicted. Specifically:
- "Columns turning into elaborate wooden legs" → **allowed change**: the stilts become legs.
- "Straw roof morphing into leafy branches" → **allowed change**: the roof becomes foliage.
- "Satellite dish becomes a giant, lidless eye" → **allowed change**: the dish is transformed into an eye.
- "Cover the walls with intricate bark patterns" → **allowed change**: wall texture changes.
- "Orange blossoms radiate a soft aura" → **allowed change**: flowers gain glow.
- "Whispering vines cascading from the structure" → **allowed change**: new organic growth added.

No part of the instruction states that the environment (path, neighboring house, trees, sky), the presence of the child, or the general location should be removed or changed. Therefore, these are not allowed to be modified unless they conflict with the transformation logic. But since the transformation is focused solely on the house itself, environmental elements are implicitly preserved unless directly impacted.

**Allowed Changes List:**
- The shape and material of the stilts (to become wooden legs)
- The form and texture of the thatched roof (to become leafy branches)
- The satellite dish (to become a giant lidless eye)
- The surface texture of the walls (to become bark-like patterns)
- The appearance of orange blossoms (to emit a soft glow)
- Addition of whispering vines growing from the structure
- Overall silhouette and architectural identity of the house can be reinterpreted organically

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
We now apply exclusion based on what was allowed to change.

**Core recognition elements:**  
While the house is being transformed, its *original identity* as a human-built dwelling in a rural tropical setting must still be recognizable in some way. However, the instruction does not require retention of specific original forms—only that it becomes a mythic creature. Thus, no strict core identity like a famous artwork exists. Instead, we focus on **functional/logical consistency** and **visual coherence**.

However, the following elements are **not mentioned for modification** and are essential to maintain scene logic and continuity:
- The **presence of the child** sitting by the path: this is a narrative anchor; removing it would alter the scale and human context.
- The **concrete path** leading to the house: it provides spatial orientation and connection between the viewer and the structure.
- The **neighboring house with corrugated roof**: it establishes community context and contrast.
- The **banana plant and orange flowering bush** in front: they provide color and ecological grounding.
- The **sky and misty mountain backdrop**: these establish atmosphere and location.
- The **position and angle of the satellite dish relative to the house**: although it will transform, its *placement* must remain consistent unless specified otherwise—this is critical for visual logic.

Even though the dish becomes an eye, its *location* (right side, mounted externally) must be preserved to avoid disorientation. Similarly, the stilts' base points must remain grounded in the same terrain.

**Functional/logical association elements:**  
- The **stilts** must remain connected to the ground and support the house—even if turned into legs, their functional role as supports cannot be lost. Their base contact points must stay fixed.
- The **path's alignment** must remain continuous from foreground to house; altering it would break spatial logic.
- The **child’s position** relative to the path and house must be maintained for narrative consistency.

**Non-modified element deduction:**  
After excluding all elements explicitly allowed to change (roof, walls, dish, stilts’ form, etc.), the remaining unmentioned visual details must be retained:
- The **color and texture of the orange flowers** (though glow is added, the flowers themselves must exist).
- The **shape and size of the banana leaves**.
- The **material and color of the neighboring house’s roof** (corrugated metal, rusted red-brown).
- The **overall lighting condition** (soft daylight, blue sky with clouds)—this sets mood and time of day.
- The **verticality of the hillside** and **vegetation density**—these define the environment.

These are not central to the transformation but are necessary for environmental realism and visual consistency.

**Preservation Targets List:**
- The presence and position of the child sitting beside the path
- The concrete path leading to the house
- The neighboring house with corrugated metal roof
- The banana plant and orange flowering shrub in the foreground
- The sky with scattered clouds and misty mountains in the background
- The overall lighting and time-of-day atmosphere
- The base positions of the stilts on the ground
- The placement of the satellite dish on the right side of the upper level
- The color and form of the orange blossoms (before glow addition)

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

Q1:  
Thinking process: The child sitting beside the path is a key narrative and scale element. Its presence grounds the scene in human reality and provides perspective. Removing or relocating it would disrupt the spatial relationship between the observer and the structure, making the edited image feel disconnected. It is not mentioned in the transformation instructions, so it must be preserved. This is a core contextual element with high weight due to its role in anchoring the scene.  
Question: Is the child still seated on the edge of the path near the water container, facing away from the house?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The concrete path is a critical environmental feature that defines access and movement within the scene. It connects the foreground to the house and guides the viewer’s eye. Altering its shape or removing it would destroy the spatial logic of the composition. Since the instruction does not mention modifying the path, it must remain intact. This is a major scene element affecting coherence.  
Question: Does the curved concrete path extend from the bottom right corner of the image toward the house without deviation or interruption?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The neighboring house with the corrugated metal roof provides contextual depth and shows that this is part of a settlement. Its rusted red-brown color and angled roof are distinctive and help distinguish it from the main subject. Changing or removing it would isolate the house unnaturally. As it is not referenced in the transformation, it must be preserved. This is an important environmental detail.  
Question: Is there a smaller building with a rusted corrugated metal roof visible to the left of the main house?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The banana plant and orange flowering shrub are prominent in the foreground and contribute to the tropical ambiance. They serve as natural framing elements and add color contrast. While the orange blossoms are said to radiate a soft aura, their physical presence must remain. Their shapes and positions are essential for visual balance and ecological authenticity.  
Question: Are the large green banana leaves and the cluster of bright orange flowers clearly visible in the foreground, just below the house?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The satellite dish is being transformed into an eye, but its *location*—on the right side of the upper level, attached via a metal arm—is critical for maintaining visual continuity. If moved or repositioned, the transformation would appear arbitrary. The dish’s original position must be preserved even as it becomes an eye. This is a functional and logical anchor point.  
Question: Is the satellite dish located on the right side of the upper floor, extending outward from the structure on a black metal pole?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The base of the stilts must remain anchored to the ground to preserve the structural logic of the house. Even if the stilts become legs, their footpoints must align with the original terrain. Displacing them would create a floating or unstable illusion, breaking realism. This is a functional requirement tied to the original design.  
Question: Are the lower ends of the stilts firmly planted in the soil along the slope beneath the house?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The sky and distant misty mountains establish the setting and mood. The blue sky with wispy clouds and low-lying fog over the hills are key atmospheric elements. These are not mentioned for alteration, so they must remain unchanged to preserve the environment. Losing them would make the scene feel alien or inconsistent.  
Question: Is the background composed of rolling green hills covered in dense forest, fading into mist under a partly cloudy blue sky?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q8:  
Thinking process: The orange blossoms are specifically mentioned to glow, but their physical form must remain. Their presence is vital for color harmony and biological realism. Even with added aura, the actual flower clusters must be present and identifiable. This is a minor detail but contributes to visual fidelity.  
Question: Are there distinct clusters of bright orange flowers growing near the base of the house, adjacent to the banana plant?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1
