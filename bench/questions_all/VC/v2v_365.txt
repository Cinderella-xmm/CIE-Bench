### Step 1 - Description of Reference Image and Allowed Changes List

**Description of Reference Image:**  
The subject is a turtle positioned on a natural ground surface with sparse green vegetation. The turtle has a distinctively patterned shell with alternating tan and dark brown markings, a sturdy build, and textured limbs. Its head is extended forward, and its eyes are visible. The background is an earthy, natural setting with soft focus.

**Thinking Process:**  
The instructions specify transforming the turtle into a Q-style 3D character with a fashion designer theme. This involves altering the turtle's proportions, adding clothing and accessories, and changing the background. However, the shell structure and turtle attributes must be retained.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
- Turtle's form can be reimagined with a chibi-style design and long legs.  
- The background can be replaced with a solid color.  
- Clothing and accessories can be added, reflecting the fashion designer profession.  
- The aspect ratio can be adjusted to 9:16.  
- Text and layout can be added as specified.

### Step 2 - Determination of Elements That Should Remain Unchanged

**Thinking Process:**  
Core recognition elements include the turtle's shell structure and its distinctive pattern, as these are essential for identifying the subject as a turtle. Functional/logical elements include the turtle's limbs and head, which support its movement and interaction with the environment. Remaining elements, such as the texture of the shell and limbs, contribute to visual coherence.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
- Shell structure and pattern  
- Limb and head structure  
- Texture of the shell and limbs
