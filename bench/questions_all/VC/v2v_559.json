      "thinking_process": "The white cup is a core functional object in the scene, directly tied to the action of drinking. Its presence and use are central to the narrative of the image. Even in a chibi transformation, the cup must remain visually identifiable as a cup and must be held by the foreground figure. The color white is not strictly required unless specified, but the cup’s role as a drinking vessel is essential. Since the instruction specifies that the person in front is holding a cup, this object must be preserved in form and function. Losing it would break the core action of the scene, making it unrecognizable in terms of intent. Therefore, this is a high-weight element.",
      "question": "Is there a white cup being held by the foreground figure?",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The action of bringing the cup to the mouth is a key behavioral cue that defines the moment captured in the image. It establishes the purpose of the cup and the subject’s engagement with it. Even in a stylized chibi form, the hand must be positioned near the mouth, and the cup must be oriented toward the lips. This gesture is essential for maintaining the narrative logic of the scene. If this action is lost, the scene loses its intended emotional and contextual meaning. Thus, it is a critical functional element.",
      "question": "Is the cup positioned near the mouth of the foreground figure, indicating a drinking action?",

      "thinking_process": "The glowing lamp is a defining environmental feature that provides the primary light source and contributes to the warm, intimate atmosphere. The instruction explicitly mentions a \"gently glowing lamp resting on a table,\" so its presence and luminous quality must be preserved. Even if stylized, the lamp must emit light and be placed on a surface. Removing or altering its glow would disrupt the lighting logic and mood of the scene. This is a key scene element that supports the overall visual consistency.",
      "question": "Is there a lamp emitting a soft, warm glow on a table in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The second figure standing near the lamp is a structural component of the scene’s composition. The instruction specifies that the person in the back is positioned near the lamp, so their relative placement must be preserved. This maintains the spatial relationship between the two figures and the environment. While their appearance may be stylized, their position near the lamp is essential for scene coherence. Changing this would misrepresent the original spatial dynamics.",
      "question": "Is the second figure positioned near the glowing lamp in the background?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "Both individuals are wearing formal suits, as seen in the original image. The instruction specifies that both are dressed in suits, so this attire must be preserved in the edited version. Even in chibi form, the silhouette and general shape of a suit (jacket, collar, lapels) must be recognizable. This is a key attribute that defines the characters’ roles and setting. Losing the suit would change the identity of the figures and undermine the scene’s context.",
      "question": "Are both figures wearing formal suits?",

        "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The warm lighting throughout the scene is a critical atmospheric element. The instruction requires a \"photorealistic vibe\" with \"warm lighting,\" so the overall tone and color temperature must be preserved. This includes the soft shadows, highlights, and ambient glow that create the mood. Even in a stylized version, the lighting should retain its warmth and directionality. This affects the entire visual experience and is essential for maintaining the intended aesthetic.",
      "question": "Is the lighting in the scene warm and consistent with the original image’s tone?",
