Description of reference image: The subject is an open book placed on a wooden surface. The book has slightly curled pages and a pinkish cover. The pages are filled with printed text, and the background consists of a textured wooden table with natural wood grain patterns, knots, and variations in shades of brown.

### Step 1 - Allowed Changes List:
Specific element 1 that allows for changes: Slightly curled pages can be extended out of the frame.
Specific element 2 that allows for changes: Subtle curved shadows can be added around the pages to create a 3D effect.

### Step 2 - Preservation Targets List:
Thinking process:
Core recognition elements: The book's identity depends on its visible printed text, pinkish cover, and slightly aged paper texture. The wooden background is also crucial for maintaining the original context and setting.
Functional/logical association elements: The book needs to remain open in a logical and plausible manner, implying continuity between the pages and their alignment. 
Non-modified element deduction: The color of the wooden table, the positioning of the book, and the printed text on the pages should all stay consistent to uphold visual coherence.

Preservation Targets List:
(The book's open position and page alignment)
(The printed text on the pages)
(The color and texture of the pages and cover)
