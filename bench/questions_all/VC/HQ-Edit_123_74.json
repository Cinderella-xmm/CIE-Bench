      "thinking_process": "The snowboard is the defining object of the activity — without it, the subject cannot be a snowboarder. Its presence under the feet is essential for logical consistency and identity recognition. Even if cartoonized or stylized, the snowboard must still be clearly depicted as a flat, elongated board beneath the boots. This is a core identity feature, and losing it would make the image unrecognizable as a snowboarding scene. Therefore, it receives a weight of 3 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The boots are functionally linked to the snowboard — they are the interface between the rider and the board. If the boots are missing or disconnected, the action becomes implausible. Their attachment to the snowboard is critical for maintaining logical coherence in the scene. While their shape may be exaggerated, their presence and connection must be retained. This is a key functional element, hence 3 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The backpack is a key accessory indicating preparedness for outdoor winter sports. It is clearly visible in the original image and plays a role in the character’s realism and narrative. Although its size or detail might be adjusted, its presence and attachment via shoulder straps are important for visual coherence and character identity. Removing or distorting it significantly would alter the scene’s authenticity. Thus, it is an important accessory, warranting 2 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The orange-red ski suit with white diagonal stripes is a distinctive visual signature of the subject’s attire. This color pattern is prominent and unique within the composition, helping to distinguish her from the background. While colors may be intensified, the basic color scheme and stripe placement must remain identifiable. Changing this entirely would obscure her identity and disrupt visual continuity. It is a core visual identifier, so it receives 3 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The snowboarder’s face and hair are essential for recognizing her as a human subject and conveying emotion and motion. The flowing hair indicates speed, and the facial expression adds personality. Even if stylized, the face must remain present and recognizable. Losing it would make the figure anonymous and reduce emotional impact. This is a core identification feature, thus weighted at 3 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The snowy mountain environment with pine trees provides the necessary context for the winter sports setting. While the texture may be changed to a paper-cut style, the presence of snow-covered trees and distant peaks must remain to preserve the scene’s identity. Removing or replacing them would fundamentally alter the setting. This is a key environmental element, so it receives 2 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The snowboarder’s posture — leaning forward with bent knees and arms extended — is crucial for conveying motion and balance. Even if exaggerated for dynamism, the general pose must reflect active snowboarding. A static or incorrect stance would break the illusion of movement. This is a key action-related element, so it receives 2 points.",
