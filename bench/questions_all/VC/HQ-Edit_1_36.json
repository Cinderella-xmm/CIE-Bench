      "thinking_process": "The elderly woman’s face, especially the network of wrinkles around the eyes and mouth, is the core identifier of her age and emotional expression. These features are unique to her identity in the original image. If they are smoothed out or stylized into cartoon-like simplicity, she becomes unrecognizable as the same individual. Therefore, the presence and pattern of facial wrinkles are critical for identity retention and must be preserved. This is a 3-point element because it defines the subject’s core identity.",

      "thinking_process": "The silver-gray hair styled in a traditional updo is a defining feature of both her age and cultural representation. The specific shape of the bun and the way the hair is parted and swept back are visually distinctive. Changing the hairstyle significantly (e.g., flattening, simplifying, or altering color) would compromise her identity. Thus, the hairstyle’s form and color must be preserved. This is a 3-point element due to its role in cultural and personal identification.",
      "question": "Is the silver-gray hair styled in a traditional updo with a clear central part and rounded bun at the back?",

Removing or altering its shape or color would misrepresent the garment. It is a key functional and cultural element. This is a 3-point element because it is a core component of the hanbok’s identity.",
      "question": "Is the white collar of the jeogori clearly visible and forming a V-shape at the neckline?",

      "thinking_process": "The coral-colored ribbon bow tied at the chest center is a signature decorative element of the hanbok. Its position and color contrast make it a focal point. Moving it or changing its form would disrupt the garment’s symmetry and authenticity. Though color can be enhanced, its **presence and placement** must remain. This is a 2-point element because it is important for garment recognition but less critical than facial features.",
      "question": "Is there a coral-colored ribbon bow located at the center of the chest, tied in a neat knot?",

      "thinking_process": "The semi-transparent outer layer of the jeogori, with visible floral embroidery along the inner edge, contributes to the garment’s aesthetic and cultural accuracy. The floral patterns are embedded in the fabric and follow a specific layout. While the instruction allows enhancement of floral motifs, the **presence of these embroidered flowers** along the inner border must remain. Their removal would alter the hanbok’s design integrity. This is a 2-point element as it supports cultural authenticity.",

      "thinking_process": "The upright, forward-facing posture of the subject is essential to the composition and emotional tone. It conveys dignity and serenity. Altering her stance (e.g., turning sideways, bending) would change the narrative and visual balance. Though the instruction allows artistic style changes, the **posture** remains a logical anchor. This is a 2-point element because it maintains spatial and emotional coherence.",

      "thinking_process": "The layered structure of the hanbok — with the semi-transparent outer jeogori over a solid underlayer — creates depth and texture. This layering is a key design feature. Even if colors are enhanced, the **visual separation between layers** must remain. Losing this would flatten the garment’s appearance. This is a 1-point element because it is a secondary detail affecting texture but not core identity.",
