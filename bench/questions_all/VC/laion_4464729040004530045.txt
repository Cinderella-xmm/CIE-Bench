**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a woman standing in a three-quarter profile pose, facing slightly to the left. She has long, straight black hair that falls over her shoulders. Her makeup includes bold cat-eye eyeliner and neutral-toned lipstick. She wears dark triangular sunglasses with thin frames, positioned low on her nose. Her ears are adorned with large hoop earrings. Around her neck is a chunky silver chain choker featuring intricate metallic details and spikes. She is wearing a sleeveless, form-fitting dress printed entirely with black-and-white newspaper-style text, including headlines such as "News," "MILLION," "Dolor sit amet," and other Latin placeholder phrases resembling newsprint. The dress has thin spaghetti straps and a fitted silhouette with a high waist and flared bottom hem. On her right wrist, she wears a black leather cuff studded with silver spikes. Her nails are painted white. The background is plain white, with no environmental elements.

Thinking process:  
The editing instruction explicitly states:  
- Transform the woman into a **Victorian-era lady** — this implies a complete transformation of her clothing style, accessories, and overall aesthetic.  
- Reimagine her **dress** with a **high-neck, lace-trimmed bodice** and **voluminous floral skirt** — this directly changes the form, structure, and pattern of the original dress.  
- Replace accessories with **pearl choker**, **dainty earrings**, and **lace gloves** — this replaces all existing jewelry and handwear.  
- Set her in a **lush Victorian garden** with **vibrant flowers** and **wrought iron benches** — this completely alters the scene and background.

From this analysis, we determine:
- The **subject’s identity** (woman) remains, but her **appearance** is to be transformed.
- The **original dress design** (newspaper print, spaghetti straps, fitted silhouette) is to be replaced.
- The **accessories** (sunglasses, hoops, spiked choker, spiked cuff) are to be replaced.
- The **background** (plain white) is to be replaced with a Victorian garden.

Therefore, only the **core human form** (i.e., the presence of a woman with similar posture and body proportions) may be retained, while all specific visual features related to clothing, accessories, and setting are allowed to change.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
- Dress style (including shape, neckline, fabric texture, print pattern)  
- Accessories (sunglasses, earrings, choker, wrist cuff)  
- Background environment (white backdrop → Victorian garden)  
- Hair styling (can be changed to match era)  
- Makeup (cat-eye liner can be altered to Victorian style)  
- Posture and expression (may be adjusted for authenticity)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

Thinking process:  
We now identify what **must not change**, based on the original image and the instruction’s scope.

**Core recognition elements:**  
Although the subject is being transformed into a Victorian lady, the instruction does **not** specify changing her **basic human identity** or **body structure**. However, since the transformation is comprehensive, **no core visual feature from the original image is required to remain unchanged** — unless it is implicitly tied to identity or function.

But critically: **the original image contains no iconic artwork, famous symbol, or unique object that must be preserved**. It is a fashion photograph of a model. Therefore, **there are no immutable symbolic or artistic identifiers** like in “The Girl with Pearl Earrings” or “Starry Night.”

However, **some visual elements are present in the original image and are not mentioned in the instructions as being changed**. These may still need to be retained if they are part of the subject’s foundational appearance, unless explicitly overridden.

But here's the key: **the instruction allows full replacement of all clothing, accessories, and setting**. It does not say “retain the face” or “keep the hairstyle.” Thus, even facial features and hair could be altered.

Yet, **in professional image consistency assessment**, when a transformation is requested, we must distinguish between:
- Elements **explicitly changed** (allowed)
- Elements **not mentioned** (assumed to be modifiable unless critical)

Given that the instruction says “transform the woman,” it implies **complete reimagining**, including potentially face, hair, and body — but **only if those are not essential to identity**.

In this case, **the original image is not a known artwork or celebrity**. It is a generic fashion model. So **no element is irreplaceable**.

But wait: **the original image has specific visual traits** that could be considered part of its identity — especially **her posture, body orientation, and the fact that she is looking downward and to the side**.

This posture is **not mentioned** in the instruction as being changed. While the instruction says “transform into a Victorian lady,” it doesn’t specify new posture. So **if the edited image changes her pose significantly**, it may break visual coherence.

Thus, **posture and body orientation** become **implicit retention targets**, because altering them would make the edit feel disconnected from the original subject.

Similarly, **the white nail polish** is a minor detail, but if the instruction doesn't mention changing hands or nails, it might be assumed to remain — though it's not essential.

But ultimately, **since the instruction allows full transformation**, the only things that should be retained are:
- **The subject’s gender and general human form**
- **Her approximate body proportions and stance**
- **The direction of her gaze and head tilt**

These are **functional/logical elements** that maintain continuity between the original and edited versions.

**Non-modified element deduction:**  
After excluding everything listed in the allowed changes list, the remaining unmentioned elements include:
- The **position of the arms** (slightly bent, hands at sides)
- The **angle of the head** (tilted down, eyes looking forward-left)
- The **overall body orientation** (three-quarter profile)
- The **presence of white nail polish**
- The **natural skin tone and facial structure**

However, since the instruction says “reimagine,” these may be altered. But in professional editing, **unless explicitly changed**, **key compositional elements** like **pose and gaze direction** are often preserved to maintain subject continuity.

Therefore, we conclude:

**Preservation Targets List:**  
- The subject’s **three-quarter profile pose** (facing left, head slightly turned)  
- The **direction of her gaze** (looking downward and to the left)  
- The **approximate arm position** (relaxed at sides, palms inward)  
- The **white nail polish** on fingernails (minor detail)  
- The **long, straight black hair** (though style may change, length and color may be retained if not specified)  

Wait — but the instruction says “transform into a Victorian lady,” which typically involves **updo hairstyles**, so **hair length and style are likely to change**.

Thus, **only the pose and gaze direction** are strong candidates for retention.

But again: **is there any element that cannot be changed without breaking identity?**

No. Because it’s not a famous person or artwork.

So the **only elements that should be retained** are those **not mentioned in the allowed changes** and **critical for maintaining the subject’s presence and continuity**.

Final decision: **Only the basic body orientation and pose** should be retained, as they define the subject’s spatial relationship in the frame.

But note: **the instruction does not require retaining any specific feature**, so **all elements are fair game**.

However, **in practice**, editors preserve **posture and composition** unless instructed otherwise.

Thus, **we retain:**
- The **three-quarter profile view** (left-facing)
- The **head tilt** (slightly downward)
- The **arm placement** (at sides, relaxed)
- The **hand position** (palms inward, fingers slightly curled)
- The **white nail polish** (as a visible detail)

Even though these are not “core” like a pearl earring, they contribute to **visual consistency**.

Therefore:

**Preservation Targets List:**  
- The subject’s **three-quarter profile pose**  
- The **downward tilt of the head**  
- The **position of the arms at the sides**  
- The **white nail polish on the fingernails**  
- The **general body orientation** (facing left, not front-on or back)

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Retained Elements**

Now, extract **specific visual features** from the original image that are **retained** and convert them into **yes/no questions** that test whether they are preserved in the edited version.

Each question must:
- Be based on an actual visual element in the original
- Not depend on added content (e.g., no “is the garden lush?” — that’s new)
- Focus on **retained** features
- Be concrete and verifiable

    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The subject's three-quarter profile pose is a defining compositional element in the original image. This includes her body facing left while her head is slightly turned toward the viewer. If this pose is changed to a full frontal or back view, the visual continuity with the original image is lost. Since the instruction does not specify changing the pose, and given standard editing practices, this orientation should be preserved. It is a core structural element that maintains subject identity across transformations. Losing it would result in a different subject presentation, thus affecting consistency. Hence, it is assigned 3 points.
    Question: Is the woman in the edited image positioned in a three-quarter profile view, facing to the left?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The downward tilt of the head is a distinctive facial orientation in the original image. It contributes to the mood and gaze direction, which are key to recognizing the subject’s expression and posture. Although the instruction allows transformation, the head tilt is not mentioned as something to change, and altering it significantly would disrupt the subject’s continuity. This is a functional element of pose and expression, making it important for visual coherence. Its preservation ensures the subject remains recognizable in terms of stance. Thus, it is assigned 2 points.
    Question: Is the woman’s head tilted downward in the edited image?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The arms are positioned at the sides of the body in the original image, with slight bend at the elbows and hands relaxed. This is a key part of the subject’s posture and contributes to the overall balance of the composition. Changing the arm position (e.g., raising hands or placing them on hips) would alter the silhouette and disrupt the original framing. Since no instruction specifies changing limb positions, this detail should be retained. It is a secondary but important structural element, hence assigned 2 points.
    Question: Are the woman’s arms positioned at her sides in the edited image?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The white nail polish on the fingernails is a specific detail visible in the original image. It is a minor but identifiable feature that adds to the visual accuracy of the subject’s appearance. While not critical to identity, its absence would introduce a noticeable inconsistency, especially if the rest of the appearance is preserved. Since the instruction does not mention changing the nails, and no alternative nail color or style is specified, this detail should be retained. It is a detail-level element, so assigned 1 point.
    Question: Does the woman have white nail polish on her fingernails in the edited image?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The general body orientation—specifically, that the woman is facing left rather than front or back—is crucial for maintaining the original composition. A change to a full-frontal or back view would fundamentally alter the viewer’s perspective and disconnect the edited image from the original. Since the instruction does not specify changing the orientation, and given that pose continuity is standard in such edits, this should be preserved. It is a core compositional element, thus assigned 3 points.
    Question: Is the woman facing to the left in the edited image?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
