Description of reference image: The subject is a Michael Kors wristwatch with a round silver-toned case and a black leather strap featuring an embossed crocodile texture. The watch face is silver with a brushed metallic finish, displaying Arabic numerals at the 12, 2, 4, 8, and 10 o’clock positions, while stick markers occupy the remaining hours. The brand name "MICHAEL KORS" is printed in uppercase letters below the 12 o'clock marker. The dial includes three subdials: one at the 3 o’clock position for 24-hour display, one at the 6 o’clock position for seconds, and one at the 9 o’clock position for minutes. A rectangular date window showing "18" is located near the 4 o’clock position. The outer bezel has minute markings from 5 to 60. The hands are silver-toned, with a slender hour and minute hand and a thin second hand. On the right side of the case, there are two pushers and a crown, indicating chronograph functionality. The leather strap is stitched along the edges with visible tan-colored thread, and the inner lining appears light beige. The overall design is elegant and modern, combining minimalist aesthetics with functional chronograph elements.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions that clearly state what can be changed. The instruction specifies transforming the watch into a whimsical anthropomorphic character named 'Chrono', which implies altering the form and function of the original object—specifically, turning it into a cartoon detective figure with facial features drawn on the dial. This transformation allows changes to the watch’s physical structure (e.g., adding eyes, mouth), its placement in a new scene (detective desk, cluttered office), and surrounding elements (magnifying glass, sound effects). However, the instruction does not mention changing or removing any core visual attributes of the original watch itself—such as the brand name, subdial layout, color scheme, or material textures—only how they are recontextualized within a comic strip format. Therefore, modifications are allowed to the overall composition, setting, and narrative framing, but the intrinsic design elements of the watch must remain recognizable under the transformation.

Allowed Changes List:
- The form and posture of the watch (transformed into an anthropomorphic character)
- The background environment (changed to a detective office)
- The addition of cartoonish facial features (eyes, mouth) on the dial
- Inclusion of props such as a magnifying glass and dialogue boxes
- Sound effect symbols (tick marks) around the dial
- Scene-specific details like scattered clues and desks
- Color treatment (greyscale with shiny silver accents)

Step 2 - Determine the elements that should remain unchanged

Thinking process:
Core recognition elements: The Michael Kors watch is identifiable by several key visual features: the brand name "MICHAEL KORS" printed centrally below the 12 o’clock position, the specific configuration of three subdials (at 3, 6, and 9 o’clock), the rectangular date window at 4 o’clock, the silver-toned metallic case, and the black textured leather strap with visible stitching. These are essential to maintaining identity; altering them would make the object unrecognizable as this particular model. Since the instruction asks to transform the watch into a character named Chrono, the form may change, but the underlying design must still reflect the original watch’s signature traits.

Functional/logical association elements: The chronograph function is implied by the presence of three subdials and pushers on the side. Even if personified, the mechanical logic of the watch must be preserved—for example, the subdials should still resemble their original purpose. The placement of the date window and time indicators must align with the original layout to maintain functional coherence. If these were moved or altered drastically, the parody would lose its connection to the real product.

Non modified element deduction: After excluding allowed changes (like adding faces, changing scenes, or introducing props), the remaining elements—such as the exact shape and position of the subdials, the font and location of the brand name, the texture of the leather band, and the silver tone of the case—must be retained. These are not mentioned as modifiable in the instruction and are necessary for visual consistency and brand fidelity.

Preservation Targets List:
- The text "MICHAEL KORS" positioned below the 12 o’clock marker
- The three subdials at 3, 6, and 9 o’clock positions with their respective scales (24-hour, seconds, minutes)
- The rectangular date window at 4 o’clock showing "18"
- The silver metallic finish of the case and dial
- The black leather strap with crocodile texture and visible stitching
- The outer minute track (5–60) around the edge of the dial
- The Arabic numerals at 12, 2, 4, 8, and 10 o’clock
- The position and style of the hour, minute, and second hands
- The two pushers and crown on the right side of the case

    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The brand name "MICHAEL KORS" is the primary identifier of the watch's origin and model. It is centrally placed below the 12 o’clock marker and is critical for recognizing the product. Removing or altering it would misrepresent the item, making it unidentifiable as a Michael Kors watch. Thus, it is a core identity feature with a weight of 3 points.
    Question: Is the text "MICHAEL KORS" present in uppercase letters below the 12 o'clock position on the dial?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3

    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The three subdials at 3, 6, and 9 o’clock are functional components defining the chronograph nature of the watch. Their specific positions and internal markings (24-hour, seconds, minutes) are unique to this model. Changing their layout or values would alter the watch’s identity and functionality. Hence, preserving their arrangement and content is essential, assigning a weight of 3 points.
    Question: Are there three subdials located at the 3, 6, and 9 o'clock positions, with the 3 o'clock subdial marked 24-hour scale, the 6 o'clock subdial marked seconds, and the 9 o'clock subdial marked minutes?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3

{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The rectangular date window at 4 o’clock displaying "18" is a distinctive feature of this watch model. Its precise location and shape contribute to the visual signature. Altering its position or content would disrupt the original design. As a key identifying detail, it deserves a weight of 3 points.
    Question: Is there a rectangular date window at the 4 o'clock position showing the number "18"?

{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The silver metallic finish of the case and dial is a core visual trait that defines the watch’s elegance and material quality. Changing the color or texture would fundamentally alter its appearance and brand alignment. Although the comic may use shading, the base silver tone must persist. This is a critical identity feature, thus weighted at 3 points.
    Question: Is the watch case and dial finished in a silver metallic tone with a brushed texture?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3

{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The outer minute track with numerical markings from 5 to 60 is a standard feature on chronographs and helps define the precision of the watch. Its presence reinforces the functional design. While minor artistic liberties might be taken in the comic, the track must remain intact. This is a functional detail that supports the watch’s identity, assigned a weight of 2 points.
    Question: Is there a continuous minute track around the outer edge of the dial with markings from 5 to 60?
