      "thinking_process": "The golden-yellow eyes are a defining feature of the gorilla’s expression and contribute significantly to its identity and emotional impact. In real-world gorillas, eye color and placement are key identifiers, and in this image, the contrast between the dark fur and bright eyes makes them visually dominant. If the eyes were altered in color or removed, the subject would no longer resemble the original, making this a core identity element.",
      "question": "Are the gorilla’s eyes golden-yellow in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The silverback crest is an iconic physical trait of adult male gorillas, distinguishing them from females and juveniles. Its presence confirms the subject’s species and maturity. Removing or altering this crest would misrepresent the animal, making it unrecognizable as a silverback. Thus, it is a core identification feature.",
      "question": "Is there a prominent silver-colored crest on the top of the gorilla’s head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The bananas are central to the image’s theme and narrative. Their curved shape, clustered arrangement, and visible stem are essential to recognizing them as a single bunch. Altering their form or replacing them would violate the instruction to use “the gorilla holding bananas” as central artwork. The specific grouping and curvature are unique visual identifiers.",
      "question": "Is the banana bunch composed of multiple yellow bananas curving outward from a common stem?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The gorilla’s hands are visibly gripping the banana bunch, which establishes the functional interaction between subject and object. This gesture is necessary to convey the action described in the original image. If the hands were detached or not holding the bananas, the core action would be lost, disrupting the intended narrative.",
      "question": "Are both of the gorilla’s hands actively holding the banana bunch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The dark, textured fur with visible individual strands and shading provides realism and distinguishes this gorilla from stylized or cartoon versions. The texture contributes to the lifelike quality and helps identify the species. Losing this detail would make the image appear flat or artificial, compromising its authenticity.",
      "question": "Does the gorilla have thick, dark fur with visible texture and depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The frontal pose with direct eye contact creates a powerful connection with the viewer and is a key compositional choice in the original image. This orientation is essential for maintaining the dramatic impact and ensuring the subject remains the focal point. Changing the angle or turning the head would alter the emotional tone and visual balance.",
      "question": "Is the gorilla facing directly forward, making eye contact with the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The bananas show natural imperfections such as brown spots and minor bruises, which add realism and indicate ripeness. These details are present in the original and help distinguish them from idealized or cartoonish representations. Removing them would reduce authenticity and potentially mislead viewers about the fruit’s condition.",
      "question": "Do the bananas have visible brown spots and slight blemishes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
