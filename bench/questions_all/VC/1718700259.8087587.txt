Description of reference image: The subject is a classic blue police cruiser parked on an urban street, facing slightly toward the viewer's right. The car has a prominent black grille with horizontal slats and a central chrome bar, flanked by rectangular headlights that are illuminated. A red and blue emergency light bar sits atop the roof, with alternating red and blue lights visible. The vehicle’s body is painted in a deep royal blue, with white lettering reading "POLICE" and "CME" on the driver’s side door, accompanied by a gold-colored badge emblem featuring a shield design with a star at its center. The front bumper includes a black push guard with a license plate displaying "LIP" above "CHICAGO POLICE." The tires are black with silver hubcaps, and the windows appear tinted. The car is positioned on a paved road marked with double yellow lines, adjacent to a sidewalk and a row of historic brick buildings with arched windows and ornate stone detailing. Sunlight casts soft shadows and highlights across the scene, suggesting early morning or late afternoon lighting.

Thinking process:  
The editing instruction explicitly states to transform the police car into a detailed LEGO model using specific colors (blue and black for the body, red and blue translucent pieces for lights, beige for windows), while assembling intricate details like grille and wheels from smaller blocks. It also specifies changing the background to a plain matte gray surface to highlight the construction. This means the **form** of the car (from real vehicle to LEGO model) and the **scene environment** (urban street with buildings → plain gray surface) are allowed to change. However, the instruction does not mention altering any core identity features such as the **police markings**, **badge emblem**, **lettering**, or **overall shape and structure** of the car — these are implied to be preserved in form, even if rendered in LEGO bricks. Additionally, the instruction does not allow changes to the **functional layout** of components like the light bar, grille, or license plate content, as they are part of the car’s identifiable identity.

Allowed Changes List:  
- The physical material and texture of the car (real metal/paint → LEGO bricks)  
- The color scheme of individual parts (e.g., body made of blue and black LEGO bricks)  
- The transparency and material of the lights (red/blue translucent LEGO pieces)  
- The window panes (beige LEGO bricks instead of glass)  
- The wheel construction (assembled from smaller LEGO blocks)  
- The grille detail (built from smaller blocks)  
- The entire background environment (urban street with buildings → plain matte gray surface)

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements must remain unchanged because they define the subject’s identity. For this police car, the **"POLICE" text**, **"CME" marking**, **gold badge emblem**, **front grille design**, **emergency light bar configuration**, and **license plate text ("LIP" and "CHICAGO POLICE")** are all critical identifiers that distinguish it as a specific type of law enforcement vehicle. These elements are not only visually distinct but functionally meaningful — their alteration would compromise the car’s recognizability as a Chicago police cruiser. Even when converted into LEGO form, these features must retain their **position**, **shape**, and **content** to preserve identity.

Functional/logical association elements include the **placement of the light bar on the roof**, the **location of the badge and text on the door**, and the **layout of the grille and headlights** — all of which serve both aesthetic and practical roles in real-world police vehicles. Changing these positions or forms would break the logical coherence of the vehicle’s design, especially since the instruction emphasizes “detailed” LEGO assembly, implying fidelity to original structure.

Non-modified element deduction: After excluding the allowed changes (material, color palette, background), the remaining visual elements — such as the **presence of the badge**, **exact text content**, **light bar pattern**, **grille shape**, and **wheel placement** — must be preserved. These are not mentioned as changeable and are essential to maintaining the original subject’s integrity.

Preservation Targets List:  
- The presence and position of the "POLICE" and "CME" text on the driver’s side door  
- The gold badge emblem with shield and star design on the door  
- The configuration and color sequence of the rooftop emergency light bar (red-blue-red-blue)  
- The front grille with horizontal slats and central chrome bar  
- The license plate reading "LIP" above "CHICAGO POLICE"  
- The overall silhouette and proportions of the police car (four-door sedan with long hood and trunk)  
- The position and shape of the headlights and turn signals  
- The placement of the front push bumper and its integration with the grille

    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The "POLICE" and "CME" text on the driver’s side door is a core identification feature, directly indicating the vehicle's purpose and department. Its absence or replacement would make the vehicle unrecognizable as a police car associated with the CME unit. This text is clearly visible and legible in the original image, and since the instruction does not specify altering it, it must be retained exactly as shown, even in LEGO form. Thus, preserving the text is essential for identity recognition.
    Question: Is the "POLICE" and "CME" text present on the driver’s side door in the same position and font style?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The gold badge emblem with the shield and star is a distinctive insignia that identifies the police department. Its unique shape and placement on the door are key visual markers that differentiate this vehicle from others. Since the instruction calls for a "detailed LEGO model," the emblem must be replicated accurately in form and position to maintain authenticity. Loss of this element would severely impair recognition.
    Question: Is the gold-colored badge emblem with a shield and star design located on the driver’s side door?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The emergency light bar on the roof has a specific red-blue-red-blue alternating pattern, which is standard for police vehicles and crucial for identifying its function. The instruction specifies using red and blue translucent LEGO pieces, so the pattern must be preserved. Any deviation in sequence or color would misrepresent the vehicle’s operational identity.
    Question: Does the rooftop light bar have the exact red-blue-red-blue color sequence from left to right?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3

{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The front grille with horizontal slats and a central chrome bar is a defining structural feature of the car’s design. It contributes to the vehicle’s iconic look and is not mentioned as changeable. In the LEGO version, this grille must be constructed to match the original’s shape and layout to preserve the car’s identity.
    Question: Is the front grille composed of horizontal slats with a central chrome bar?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The license plate with "LIP" above "CHICAGO POLICE" is a functional identifier that links the vehicle to a specific jurisdiction. Although the instruction allows material changes, it does not permit altering the text. Retaining this text ensures the vehicle remains identifiable as belonging to the Chicago Police Department.
    Question: Is the license plate displaying "LIP" above "CHICAGO POLICE"?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The overall silhouette of the four-door sedan with a long hood and trunk is essential for recognizing the vehicle type. Even in LEGO form, the proportions and shape must remain consistent to maintain the car’s identity. Altering this would make it unrecognizable as a classic police cruiser.
    Question: Does the car maintain the four-door sedan silhouette with a long hood and trunk?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The headlights and turn signals are positioned symmetrically and are integral to the car’s front-end design. Their placement and shape contribute to the vehicle’s recognizable profile. Since the instruction requires a detailed LEGO model, these elements must be accurately replicated in position and form.
    Question: Are the rectangular headlights and amber turn signals positioned symmetrically on the front fenders?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
