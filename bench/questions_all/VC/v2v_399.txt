Description of reference image: The subject is a golden vase with intricate floral patterns and a bouquet of vibrant red flowers in a smaller pot. The vase has a bulbous body, a narrow neck, and a flared rim, all adorned with detailed engravings. The flowers are richly colored with green leaves, creating a striking contrast against the beige background. Both objects rest on a smooth, light-colored surface.

Thinking process: First, analyze the instructions that clearly state what can be changed, such as transforming the vase into a form made entirely of blossoming flowers. This implies changes to the material and texture of the vase but not its overall shape or position. The scene environment and background elements should remain unchanged unless specified otherwise. Quantity, proportion, and angle adjustments are not mentioned, so these parameters should stay consistent.

Allowed Changes List:
Specific element 1 that allows for changes
- Material and texture of the vase (changing from metal to floral composition)
(Specific elements allowed for change 2)
...

Step 2- Determine the elements that should remain unchanged

Thinking process:
Core recognition elements: The vase's iconic shape (bulbous body, narrow neck, flared rim) must be retained as it is central to identifying the object. The bouquet's vibrant red color and green leaves are key visual features that should also remain unchanged.
Functional/logical association elements: The relative positions of the vase and the flower pot need to be preserved to maintain logical consistency within the scene.
Non modified element deduction: After excluding allowed changes, details like the beige background and the smooth surface beneath the objects should be retained for visual coherence.

Preservation Targets List:â€‹
(Element 1 that should be maintained)
- Shape and proportions of the vase
(Element 2 that should be maintained)
- Vibrant red color and green leaves of the flowers

Q1: 
Thinking process: The vase's shape is a core identity feature; losing it would make the object unrecognizable. It is crucial for maintaining the vase's iconic form.

Question: Is the vase positioned next to the flower pot in the same manner as in the original image?
Choices: yes, no
A: yes
Weight: 2

Q4: 
Thinking process: The beige background provides a neutral setting that highlights the main subjects, contributing to the overall visual consistency.
