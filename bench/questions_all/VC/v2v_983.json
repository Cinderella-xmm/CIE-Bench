      "thinking_process": "The tan and black fur color distribution is the most defining visual trait of the dog, especially the contrast between the tan face and legs and the black back. This pattern is critical for identifying the dog and must be preserved in the creature’s design to ensure it is clearly inspired by this specific animal. Losing this pattern would make the creature appear unrelated to the original dog, undermining the core of the transformation. Therefore, this is a key identification feature with a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the tan and black fur color distribution, particularly the tan face and legs with black back, preserved in the creature’s design?",

      "thinking_process": "The floppy ear shape and positioning are distinctive features of the dog’s head structure. They contribute to the creature’s overall silhouette and help maintain visual continuity. While the ears may be stylized, their basic shape and placement must remain consistent to preserve the dog’s identity. This is a core recognition element, so it carries a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Are the floppy ears, with their rounded shape and downward angle, preserved in the creature’s head design?",

      "thinking_process": "The open mouth with visible pink tongue and teeth is a key expressive feature of the dog, conveying its relaxed and friendly demeanor. This detail is important for maintaining the \"adorable\" aspect of the creature and ensuring emotional continuity. It is a prominent facial feature that should be retained in the fantasy version. This is a core identity element, so it receives a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the open mouth with a visible pink tongue and exposed teeth preserved in the creature’s facial expression?",

      "thinking_process": "The blue collar with black buckle is a functional and visually distinct accessory. It is a unique identifier of the dog and may influence the design of the orb. Since the orb must reflect the dog’s appearance, the collar’s color (blue) is likely to be incorporated. Removing or changing the collar would break the logical link between the dog and the orb. This is a functional/logical element, so it is assigned a weight of 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the blue collar with a black buckle present on the creature, either as part of its design or reflected in the orb’s color scheme?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The lying posture with front paws extended forward is a key pose that defines the dog’s relaxed state. The instruction mentions taking inspiration from the dog’s posture, so this stance must be preserved in the creature’s full-body depiction. It contributes to the overall composition and helps maintain the sense of calmness and approachability. This is an important scene/pose element, so it is given a weight of 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the creature depicted in a lying-down pose with front paws extended forward, mirroring the dog’s original posture?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The facial structure, including the dark eyes, dark nose, and tan muzzle, forms the core of the dog’s face. These features are essential for recognition and must be preserved in the creature’s design. The eyes’ position relative to the ears and the shape of the snout are critical for maintaining the dog’s likeness. This is a core recognition element, so it is assigned a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Are the dark eyes, dark nose, and tan muzzle preserved in the creature’s facial structure?",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The proportional body shape—medium-sized, muscular build with a defined chest and back—is a secondary but important detail that contributes to the dog’s overall form. While the creature may be stylized, the general proportions should reflect the original dog’s physique. This helps maintain visual coherence and ensures the creature feels like a believable transformation. This is a detail-level element, so it is given a weight of 1 point.",
      "question": "Does the creature retain the medium-sized, muscular body proportions of the original dog, including a broad chest and defined back?",
