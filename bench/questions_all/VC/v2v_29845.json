      "thinking_process": "The long, curved horns are a defining characteristic of the Highland cow and are explicitly mentioned in the instruction as a feature to be combined into the new figure. Their unique upward-sweeping shape and position on the head are critical for identifying the animal origin of the hybrid. If these horns are absent or significantly altered in shape, the cow’s identity is lost, undermining the intent of the edit. Therefore, this is a core identity element with a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Are the long, upward-curving horns of the cow present and retaining their original shape and position on the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The reddish-brown shaggy fur is a key visual identifier of the Highland cow and is specifically mentioned in the instruction as a feature to be included. The texture and color are essential for distinguishing this breed from others and contribute to the realism of the hybrid. Losing this fur would remove a major component of the cow’s identity. Thus, it is a core element with a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the reddish-brown shaggy fur covering the body of the hybrid figure, particularly on the head and shoulders, present and consistent with the original cow’s appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The white lab coat is a distinctive piece of clothing worn by the man and is explicitly referenced in the instruction as a feature to be retained in the hybrid. It is a key identifier of the man’s role and appearance. Its presence and color are essential for maintaining the human aspect of the fusion. Altering or removing it would break the continuity of the man’s identity. Hence, it is a core element with a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the white lab coat visible on the upper body of the hybrid figure, including the lapels, pockets, and full length down to the waist?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The dark tie under the lab coat is a specific detail of the man’s attire and contributes to the formal appearance of the figure. While less central than the coat, it is part of the clothing ensemble that must be preserved according to the instruction. Its presence helps maintain the integrity of the man’s original look. It is an important accessory, so it carries a weight of 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the dark-colored tie visible beneath the collar of the lab coat on the hybrid figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The brown trousers and black dress shoes are part of the man’s lower-body attire and are essential for completing the human form. The instruction mentions preserving the man’s posture, which includes the stance and leg movement. The trousers and shoes are necessary to support this posture visually. Their absence would disrupt the coherence of the human element. They are important but not as central as the coat or horns, so they carry a weight of 2 points.",
      "question": "Are the brown trousers and black dress shoes present on the lower half of the hybrid figure, with the right leg slightly raised in a walking motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The forward walking posture with one leg lifted is a dynamic element of the original image and is explicitly tied to the man’s movement. The instruction requires preserving the man’s posture, meaning the gait and balance must be maintained in the hybrid. This posture is crucial for conveying motion and continuity. It is a key functional element, so it carries a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Does the hybrid figure exhibit a forward walking posture with the right leg lifted off the ground, mimicking the original man’s stride?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
