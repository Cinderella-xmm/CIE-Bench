      "thinking_process": "The dark brown branch serves as the primary structural anchor for the composition. It provides the perch for the bird and defines the spatial relationship between the subject and the environment. If the branch were removed or significantly altered in shape or position, the entire scene would lose coherence and logical grounding. Its presence is essential for maintaining the original visual narrative. The instruction does not mention changing the branch, only transforming the bird and adding new elements, so the branch must remain intact. This is a core functional element supporting both subject placement and scene realism.",
      "question": "Is the dark brown tree branch on which the bird is perched clearly visible and positioned in the same location as in the original image?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The pink cherry blossoms are central to both the scene and the transformation theme. They are not only background elements but also integrated into the new design (e.g., tail replaced with blossoms). Their presence ensures continuity between the original and edited versions. Removing or altering their color, shape, or number would disrupt the thematic consistency. The original image shows distinct five-petaled flowers with yellow stamens and pink petals — these specific visual traits must be preserved even if stylized. This is a key environmental identifier.",
      "question": "Are the pink five-petaled cherry blossoms with visible yellow stamens and red centers still present in the scene, particularly near the bird and along the branches?",

      "thinking_process": "The bird’s position on the branch — centered, facing slightly left — establishes the composition. Even after transformation, the subject must occupy the same spatial location to maintain visual alignment with the original. Changing its position would misalign the viewer’s focus and break the intended framing. This is a critical compositional element.",
      "question": "Is the bird (or its transformed spirit form) positioned on the same branch, in the same central-left location, facing toward the left side of the frame?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The green leaves emerging from the branches are minor but important detail elements that reinforce the springtime setting. While not central to the transformation, their presence contributes to the naturalism of the scene. The original image shows young, curled green leaves with visible veins. Their retention ensures visual fidelity to the season and environment. Although not core, they are distinctive enough to affect coherence if removed.",
      "question": "Are there fresh green leaves with curled tips and visible veins growing from the branches, particularly near the bird and in the foreground?",

      "thinking_process": "The warm golden sunlight coming from the upper left creates a soft glow and highlights the bird and blossoms. This lighting direction is crucial for mood and depth. The instruction does not specify changing the lighting, so the original illumination must be preserved to maintain atmospheric consistency. Altering the light source would change the time of day and emotional tone. This is a key environmental feature.",
      "question": "Is the sunlight originating from the upper left, casting a warm golden glow across the scene and creating soft highlights on the bird and blossoms?",

      "thinking_process": "The background features blurred cherry blossoms and branches, creating a bokeh effect that enhances depth. This layering is essential for spatial perception. While the background may be softened further, the **presence of out-of-focus pink blooms and dark branches** must remain to preserve the sense of a dense flowering tree. Removing this would flatten the image and disconnect it from the original setting.",
      "question": "Does the background contain softly blurred pink cherry blossoms and dark tree branches, forming a layered depth effect behind the main subject?",
