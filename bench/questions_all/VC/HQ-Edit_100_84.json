      "thinking_process": "The three triangular sails are the defining feature of the dhow’s silhouette and distinguish it from other vessels. Their number and shape are critical to identifying the boat type. Removing or altering them would make the vessel unrecognizable as a traditional dhow. This is a core identity element, hence weighted at 3 points.",
      "question": "Are there exactly three triangular sails attached to the dhow, arranged in a staggered vertical line?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The wooden hull with arched windows and decorative railing is a structural hallmark of the dhow’s design. It provides both functional and aesthetic identity. Even with added ornamentation, the base structure must remain visible to maintain authenticity. This is a core functional/formal element, thus weighted at 3 points.",
      "question": "Does the dhow have a wooden hull with visible arched windows and decorative lattice railings along the upper deck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The diagonal placement of the boat from lower-left to upper-right creates dynamic motion and depth. This positioning is essential for compositional balance and viewer engagement. Altering this would misrepresent the scene’s spatial logic. It is a key compositional element, so it receives a weight of 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the dhow oriented diagonally across the frame, with its bow pointing toward the upper right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The presence of distant sailboats establishes context and scale. Although the instruction allows simplification, their removal would break continuity with the original scene. Their existence is necessary for environmental consistency, making this an important scene element with a weight of 2 points.",
      "question": "Are there multiple small sailboats visible on the horizon in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The sun’s position low on the left and its reflection on the water define the time of day and lighting condition. This is a key atmospheric anchor. While color intensity may change, the sun’s location and reflection path must remain to preserve realism and mood. This is a significant environmental detail, thus weighted at 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the sun located low on the left side of the image, casting a bright golden reflection across the water surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The interaction between the dhow and the water—specifically the visible wake and reflection beneath the hull—is essential for conveying motion and realism. Even with added fantasy elements, this physical relationship must remain intact. It supports logical consistency in the scene and is a secondary but important detail, earning 1 point.",
      "question": "Is there a visible wake and reflection of the dhow beneath its hull on the water surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The pointed bow with an extended prow is a distinctive feature of traditional dhows. Its shape contributes to the boat’s identity and distinguishes it from other ship types. While ornamentation may be added, the basic form must be preserved. This is a minor but identifiable structural detail, so it is assigned 1 point.",
      "question": "Does the dhow have a long, pointed bow extending forward from the hull?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
