      "thinking_process": "The amber-colored liquid in the short glass is a core identification feature of the drink, distinguishing it from other beverages. Its presence and color are essential to recognizing the drink as a cocktail or iced tea variant. If lost, the drink loses its identity. This is a key visual element directly tied to the subject's recognition.",

      "thinking_process": "The yellow straw is a distinctive accessory that contributes to the drink’s identity and visual balance. Its presence is necessary to confirm the drink's setup as seen in the original. Losing it would make the drink appear incomplete or altered beyond recognition.",
      "question": "Is a yellow straw inserted into the short glass?",

      "thinking_process": "The ice cubes in the short glass are critical to identifying the drink as \"frozen.\" Their presence confirms the cooling state and physical nature of the beverage. Without them, the drink would lose its defining characteristic.",
      "question": "Are ice cubes visible within the short glass?",

      "thinking_process": "The tall glass filled entirely with ice forms an iceberg-like structure, serving as a visual centerpiece and symbolic element. Its fullness and ice composition are central to the scene’s theme. Even if textured differently, its function as an ice tower must remain intact.",
      "question": "Is the tall glass completely filled with ice?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The Sydney Opera House’s unique shell-like architecture is its most recognizable feature. Even when rendered in neon line art, the basic shape and arrangement of the shells must be preserved to maintain identity. Altering this would result in a loss of geographic and cultural reference.",
      "question": "Are the sail-like shells of the Sydney Opera House visible in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The stone ledge provides spatial grounding for the drinks and maintains compositional balance. Its presence ensures the scene remains coherent and realistic, even in a digital transformation. Removing it would disrupt the visual hierarchy.",
      "question": "Is there a stone ledge beneath the two glasses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The relative positioning of the two glasses — one short, one tall, side by side — is crucial for visual storytelling and symmetry. Changing their positions would alter the intended composition and viewer perception.",
      "question": "Are the two glasses positioned side by side on the ledge, with the short glass on the left and the tall glass on the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
