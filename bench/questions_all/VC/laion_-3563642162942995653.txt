**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a vintage military truck, painted in olive green, positioned at a slight angle facing left. The truck has a classic cab-over-engine design with a rounded front grille, two round headlights, and a prominent hood. It features a large, boxy cargo body mounted on the chassis, with a curved roofline and two small rectangular windows on the side. The vehicle has six wheels (6x6 configuration), with thick off-road tires showing mud caked around the rims. The ground beneath is muddy and uneven, marked with tire tracks. In the background, there are trees forming a forested hillside under a pale blue sky with light cloud cover. A partial view of another military vehicle is visible to the far left.

Thinking process:  
The editing instruction explicitly states that the truck should be transformed into a **crystal sculpture** made of **emerald and jade facets**, with **transparent quartz wheels**, placed on a **white marble platform**. This indicates a complete transformation of the **subject’s material form**, **texture**, **color**, and **surface properties**, while also altering the **ground surface** from muddy terrain to a sleek, artificial exhibit platform. The instruction does not mention retaining any original visual characteristics beyond the **form or silhouette** of the truck — only that it should be reshaped into a crystal version.

Allowed Changes List:  
- The **material composition** of the truck (metal → crystal)  
- The **texture** of the surface (matte paint → reflective facets)  
- The **color scheme** of the truck (olive green → emerald/jade hues)  
- The **wheels** (muddy rubber → transparent quartz)  
- The **ground surface** (muddy earth → white marble platform)  
- The **overall aesthetic style** (utilitarian military vehicle → artistic sculpture)  

These changes are fully permitted by the instruction, which calls for a complete metamorphosis of the object into an ornamental crystal sculpture.

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

Thinking process:  
Despite the extensive transformation described, certain elements must remain unchanged based on **core recognition**, **functional logic**, and **visual coherence**:

- **Core recognition elements**: While the material and color change, the **overall shape and structure** of the truck — including its **cab position**, **cargo body**, **wheel count and arrangement**, **window placement**, and **grille design** — define its identity as a specific type of military truck. If these structural features are altered, the resulting sculpture would no longer be recognizable as the original vehicle. Therefore, **the silhouette and spatial layout** of the truck must be preserved.

- **Functional/logical association elements**: The **six-wheel configuration** (three axles) is essential for identifying the vehicle as a heavy-duty 6x6 military truck. Changing the number or positioning of wheels would disrupt this functional logic. Similarly, the **position of the cabin relative to the cargo body** and the **placement of windows** must remain consistent to preserve the vehicle's logical structure.

- **Non-modified element deduction**: Although the texture and material are changed, the **presence and location** of key components such as the **front grille**, **headlights**, **side mirrors**, **door handle**, and **ladder on the cargo side** must remain in their original positions. These are not mentioned in the instructions as being replaced or removed, so they must be retained in their **original spatial relationships** even if rendered in crystal.

Preservation Targets List:  
- The **overall silhouette and proportions** of the truck (including cab, cargo body, and wheelbase)  
- The **position and number of wheels** (six total, three axles)  
- The **placement of the front grille** (vertical slats, centered on the front)  
- The **location of the two side windows** on the cargo body  
- The **position of the door handle** on the driver’s side  
- The **presence of the ladder** on the side of the cargo body  
- The **relative position of the cab to the cargo section**  
- The **angle and orientation** of the vehicle in the scene (slightly angled toward the left)

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The **six-wheel configuration** (three axles) is a defining structural feature of this military truck model. Its presence and arrangement are critical for identifying the vehicle as a 6x6 heavy-duty transport. Even when transformed into a crystal sculpture, the number and spacing of wheels must remain identical to maintain functional and visual fidelity. Losing this detail would result in a misrepresentation of the original vehicle’s identity.
    Question: Does the edited image retain exactly six wheels arranged in three axles, with the front axle near the cab and two rear axles supporting the cargo body?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The **position of the cargo body relative to the cab** is a core spatial relationship that defines the truck’s layout. Moving or resizing this section would distort the vehicle’s identity. Even in crystal form, the cargo body must extend directly behind the cab with the same alignment and length ratio.
    Question: Is the cargo body positioned directly behind the cab, maintaining the same horizontal alignment and proportional length as in the original image?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The **two rectangular windows** on the side of the cargo body are distinctive features that help identify the vehicle’s design. Their placement is fixed and essential for recognition. Replacing or relocating them would alter the truck’s appearance significantly.
    Question: Are there two rectangular windows visible on the side of the cargo body, located approximately one-third and two-thirds along its length?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The **front grille** with vertical slats is a signature design element of this truck model. Its presence and central placement on the front are key identifiers. Even in a crystal version, the grille must occupy the same location and maintain its structural outline.
    Question: Is the vertical slatted grille present on the front of the vehicle, centered between the headlights and aligned with the hood?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The **side mirror** on the driver’s side is a minor but identifiable component. Its presence confirms the vehicle’s operational design. While not critical for overall recognition, its absence would introduce a noticeable inconsistency in the recreation.
    Question: Is there a side mirror attached to the driver’s side door, extending outward from the upper portion of the door?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}

{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The **ladder** on the side of the cargo body is a functional detail that contributes to the vehicle’s authenticity. Its position and shape are specific to this model. Removing it would reduce the accuracy of the representation.
    Question: Is there a horizontal ladder affixed to the lower side of the cargo body, running parallel to the ground?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}

{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The **door handle** on the driver’s side is a small but consistent feature across the truck’s design. Its retention ensures attention to detail and maintains the vehicle’s recognizable form.
    Question: Is there a silver-colored door handle visible on the driver’s side door, positioned midway down the door?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
