      "thinking_process": "The wooden tray beneath the tagine is a functional component of the original setup, designed to collect moisture during cooking. It is visually distinct—a shallow, round, earthenware-like dish with a rough texture and warm brown color. Although the tagine itself is transformed, the tray is not mentioned in the editing instructions, meaning it should remain unchanged. Its retention maintains logical consistency between the object and its use environment. Removing it would break the functional narrative of the original scene. This is a critical structural element tied to the tagine’s purpose, so it must be preserved.",

      "thinking_process": "The glass bottle of olive oil with a cork stopper is a key contextual element in the scene. It is clearly visible in the background, filled with golden-yellow liquid, and mounted on a small stone or clay pedestal. It contributes to the Mediterranean culinary theme. The editing instruction does not mention modifying this object, so it must remain. Its presence reinforces the authenticity of the setting. Altering or removing it would disrupt the scene’s realism and thematic coherence.",

Its texture—visible grain, cracks, and weathered appearance—is essential for grounding the scene in a rustic kitchen environment. The instruction does not specify altering the table, so it must remain. Changing it would shift the entire aesthetic tone. Retaining the wood texture ensures continuity in the scene’s atmosphere.",
