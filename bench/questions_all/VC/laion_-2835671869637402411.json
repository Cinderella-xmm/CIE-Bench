      "thinking_process": "The stone steps serve as the foundational platform for the entire scene. Their presence and texture are essential to grounding the character and maintaining spatial continuity. Changing or removing them would disrupt the environmental logic and make the scene unrecognizable as derived from the original. This is a core structural element with high visual weight.",
      "question": "Are the stone steps beneath the character present and textured with visible cracks and moss-like details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The arched window with iron bars is a defining architectural feature of the background. Its shape and material are unique identifiers of the ruinous structure. Removing or altering it would change the setting’s identity and break the scene’s historical ambiance, making it inconsistent with the original.",
      "question": "Is there an arched window with vertical iron bars visible in the background behind the character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The vines and overgrown foliage are critical to the atmosphere and visual framing of the scene. They create depth and mystery, and their presence is central to the Halloween/gothic aesthetic. Their removal would leave the scene feeling bare and disconnected from the original mood.",
      "question": "Are dark, twisting vines with dried leaves covering the walls and archways around the character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The scattered colorful candies on the steps are minor but distinctive decorative elements. While not core to identity, they contribute to the narrative context (trick-or-treating) and provide visual contrast. Their absence would reduce consistency with the original scene.",
      "question": "Are multiple small, round, multicolored candies scattered on the stone steps near the character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The character’s seated posture—specifically cross-legged with arms positioned near the chest—is a key compositional detail. Even if her form becomes a doll, this pose must be preserved to maintain continuity in action and spatial relationship to the environment.",
      "question": "Is the character sitting cross-legged on the steps with her hands near her chest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The relative positioning of objects—sewing kit/figurine on the left, oil lamp on the right—must mirror the original left-right balance. The spatial symmetry contributes to visual harmony. Reversing or misplacing them would break scene logic.",
      "question": "Is the object replacement consistent with original placement: sewing kit and porcelain figurine on the left, oil lamp on the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The ambient lighting, particularly the warm glow emanating from the light source (now oil lamp), is crucial to the mood. The original pumpkin provided directional illumination; the oil lamp must replicate this effect to maintain visual coherence and emotional tone.",
      "question": "Does the oil lamp emit a warm, golden glow that illuminates the surrounding area, similar to the original pumpkin’s light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
