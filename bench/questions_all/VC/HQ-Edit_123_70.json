      "thinking_process": "The bear’s hump-backed silhouette with a prominent shoulder ridge is a key anatomical feature distinguishing it from other animals like wolves or humans. This shape is essential for identifying the animal as a grizzly or brown bear. If this silhouette is altered (e.g., flattened or humanoid), the animal would no longer be recognizable as a bear, undermining the core identity of the subject. Therefore, preserving this specific body shape is critical.",
      "question": "Is the bear's body shaped with a distinct hump over the shoulders and a broad, muscular back?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The salmon’s forked tail fin is a defining morphological trait of Pacific salmon species. Its presence confirms the fish’s identity and distinguishes it from other fish like trout or tuna. Removing or altering this feature would misrepresent the species and break the biological accuracy required for an educational comic. Hence, it is a core identification element.",
      "question": "Does the salmon have a clearly defined forked tail fin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The bear’s wet, textured fur with visible individual strands and darker patches is a signature detail of the original image. This level of detail contributes to the realism and helps distinguish it from stylized or cartoonish depictions. While the comic may simplify textures, the basic fur pattern and coloration (dark brown with lighter highlights) must be retained to maintain visual coherence with the source material.",
      "question": "Is the bear’s fur rendered with visible texture and layered shading, showing wetness and depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The salmon’s silvery underbelly and blue-green dorsal side are characteristic of adult Pacific salmon in freshwater environments. These colors are essential for accurate representation and ecological authenticity. Even in a simplified comic, these hues must be preserved to ensure scientific correctness and visual consistency with the original.",
      "question": "Is the salmon colored with a blue-green back and a silvery-white belly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The bear is shown standing in water with splashes around its legs, indicating movement and interaction with the river. This dynamic pose establishes the action of fishing. Even in the comic version, the bear must be shown in proximity to water or engaged in a similar activity to maintain narrative logic. The presence of water splashes or ripples around the bear’s feet confirms this interaction.",
      "question": "Are there visible water splashes or ripples around the bear’s lower legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The bear’s snout and muzzle are key facial features that distinguish it from other mammals. They are necessary for identifying the animal as a bear, especially when viewed from the side. Altering the snout shape (e.g., making it shorter or more human-like) would compromise species recognition, even if glasses are added.",
      "question": "Does the bear have a long, broad snout with visible nostrils and a rounded muzzle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The salmon’s position in the bear’s mouth, with its head pointing outward and body angled upward, is a crucial moment of action. This orientation defines the capture event and must be preserved in the comic’s first panel to maintain continuity. Even if stylized, the fish must appear to be held in the bear’s jaws.",
      "question": "Is the salmon positioned horizontally in the bear’s mouth, with its head protruding forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
