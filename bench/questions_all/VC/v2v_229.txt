Description of reference image: The subject is a cozy bedroom scene featuring a bed with soft, textured bedding and multiple pillows. A bedside table holds a lamp emitting warm light and two lit candles. Additional candles are placed on the floor near the bed. The room has sheer curtains covering a window, and the overall ambiance is warm and inviting due to the low lighting and candlelight.

Thinking process: First, analyze the instructions that clearly state what can be changed, such as transforming the form of the original subject into a kawaii enamel pin. This allows for changes in size, proportion, and style while retaining key elements. The instruction specifies using glossy metallic outlines and bright, colorful enamel fills, indicating that colors and textures can be modified. However, the core identity of the cozy bedroom scene must be retained.

Allowed Changes List:
Specific element 1 that allows for changes: Size and proportion of objects within the scene.
Specific element 2 that allows for changes: Color palette and texture (to match the kawaii enamel pin style).
Specific element 3 that allows for changes: Background environment (to be simplified or removed).

Step 2- Determine the elements that should remain unchanged

Thinking process:
Core recognition elements: The essential features that define the cozy bedroom scene include the presence of the bed, the warm lighting from the lamp and candles, and the soft textures of the bedding. These elements must be preserved to maintain the scene's identity.
Functional/logical association elements: The relationship between the bed, bedside table, and candles must be maintained to preserve the logical coherence of the scene.
Non-modified element deduction: After excluding allowed changes, details like the specific arrangement of pillows, the shape of the lampshade, and the placement of candles need to be retained for visual consistency.

Preservation Targets List:
(Element 1 that should be maintained): The presence of the bed as the central object.
(Element 2 that should be maintained): The warm glow from the lamp and candles.
(Element 3 that should be maintained): The soft texture representation of the bedding.
(Element 4 that should be maintained): The arrangement of pillows on the bed.
(Element 5 that should be maintained): The position of the bedside table relative to the bed.
