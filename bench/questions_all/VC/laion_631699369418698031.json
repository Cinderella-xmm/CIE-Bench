      "thinking_process": "The horn-like protrusions on the top face are a defining feature of this specific totem pole design, distinguishing it from other similar carvings. Their absence would make the totem unrecognizable as the original. They are physically attached to the head and symmetrically positioned on both sides, forming part of the crown-like structure. This is a core identity element.",
      "question": "Are the two upward-curving horn-like protrusions still present on either side of the top face?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The rectangular block framing the top face is a distinctive architectural feature that sets this totem apart. Its presence contributes to the symbolic and aesthetic identity of the sculpture. Removing or altering it would fundamentally change the visual character of the uppermost section.",
      "question": "Is the rectangular frame with horizontal grooves still positioned directly below the top face?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The circular carving on the chest of the middle figure is a unique detail that adds symbolic value and helps identify the figure within the stack. Its placement and shape are consistent with traditional totem motifs. Altering or omitting it would reduce the authenticity of the carving.",
      "question": "Is there a small circular carving located on the front of the middle figure's torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The diamond-shaped pattern along the base of the totem is a recurring decorative motif that reinforces the cultural style and craftsmanship. It serves as a visual anchor at the bottom of the structure. Its removal would diminish the completeness of the design.",
      "question": "Is the diamond-patterned border still present around the lower edge of the totem?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The wood grain texture is a fundamental material characteristic of the original totem, contributing to its realism and aged appearance. While the instruction allows for enhanced colors, the underlying texture must remain visible to preserve the tactile quality of the piece.",
      "question": "Is the natural wood grain texture clearly visible across the surface of the totem?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The closed eyes and open mouths with detailed teeth are consistent across all three faces and define the expressive style of the carving. These facial features are critical for recognizing the emotional tone and stylistic intent of the totem. Changing them would misrepresent the original design.",
      "question": "Do all three faces have closed eyes and open mouths with visible teeth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The relative size and stacking order of the faces establish the hierarchical structure of the totem. The top face is smaller, the middle is medium, and the bottom is largest â€” this progression is essential for maintaining the original composition. Reversing or distorting this would break the visual logic.",
      "question": "Is the bottom face larger than the middle face, which is larger than the top face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
