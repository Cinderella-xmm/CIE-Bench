      "thinking_process": "The bright orange color of the carrots is a core recognition feature distinguishing them from other vegetables. In Cubist art, colors may be altered, but since the instruction does not specify changing the color scheme, and given that orange is a defining trait of carrots, its presence must be preserved to maintain identity. Losing this color would make the carrots unrecognizable, especially when juxtaposed with green celery and white onions. Thus, this is a key identifying element with high weight.",
      "question": "Is the pile of diced vegetables on the left side of the image orange in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The celery pieces have a unique C-shaped cross-section with a hollow center, which is a distinctive anatomical feature of celery stalks. This shape is critical for identifying the vegetable, especially when compared to the solid cubes of carrots and onions. Even in a Cubist style, the fragmented forms should retain this structural characteristic to preserve identity. Without it, the celery could be mistaken for another green vegetable.",
      "question": "Do the green vegetable pieces in the center of the image have a curved, C-shaped form with a visible hollow center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The onions are identifiable by their pale white to translucent color and cubic shape. Their translucency is a subtle but important detail that differentiates them from opaque vegetables like carrots. In a Cubist rendering, this quality might be stylized, but the color and general form must remain to ensure recognition. Losing this would compromise the distinction between the three vegetable types.",
      "question": "Are the diced vegetables on the right side of the image pale white or translucent in appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The chef’s knife is a functional object in the scene, positioned diagonally with a metallic blade and black handle. Its presence is essential for contextualizing the image as a food preparation scene. Even if stylized, the knife must remain identifiable by its shape and material properties. Removing or altering it beyond recognition would break the logical connection between the tool and the prepared ingredients.",
      "question": "Is there a knife with a metallic blade and black handle located in the upper right portion of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The wooden cutting board serves as the background surface and provides environmental context. Its warm brown color and visible horizontal wood grain are key details that ground the composition. While the texture may be abstracted in Cubist style, the board must remain present and identifiable to maintain the scene’s realism and coherence. Losing it would remove the setting entirely.",
      "question": "Is the surface beneath the vegetables and knife a wooden cutting board with visible horizontal grain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The vegetables are arranged in a triangular formation—carrots on the left, celery in the center, onions on the right. This spatial organization is a key compositional element that enhances visual balance and clarity. Even under Cubist fragmentation, the relative grouping should be preserved to maintain the intended structure and avoid confusion about the ingredient layout.",
      "question": "Are the three piles of vegetables arranged in a triangular pattern with carrots on the left, celery in the middle, and onions on the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The knife is positioned diagonally across the upper right, suggesting it was used to chop the vegetables. This spatial relationship implies functionality and action. Even if the knife is stylized, its placement relative to the vegetables should remain consistent to preserve the narrative logic of the scene. Displacing it significantly would disrupt the implied action.",
      "question": "Is the knife placed diagonally across the upper right area of the image, adjacent to the pile of onions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
