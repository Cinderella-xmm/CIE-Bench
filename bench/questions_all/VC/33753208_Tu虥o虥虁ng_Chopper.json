      "thinking_process": "The small hut with a blue roof at the summit is a distinct architectural feature that anchors the scene's geography. Its presence and position provide spatial orientation and serve as a key landmark. If removed or relocated, the viewer loses critical contextual grounding. It is not mentioned in the editing instructions for modification, so it must remain. This is a core functional element tied to the scene’s logic.",
      "question": "Is the small structure with a blue roof still present at the highest point of the ridge?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The hikers are positioned along the path and serve as scale indicators and narrative elements (human interaction with the landscape). Their presence and relative positions must remain unchanged to preserve the sense of journey and scale. The instruction does not mention removing or relocating them, so they must stay. Their absence would break the realism of the scene.",
      "question": "Are the hikers still visible along the central trail, maintaining their original positions relative to the path?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The ridge’s shape defines the entire composition—a narrow elevated spine running diagonally across the frame. This topographic form is essential for understanding the landscape’s structure. Although the path within it changes, the ridge’s outline must remain to preserve spatial integrity. Altering it would make the dragon appear disconnected from the terrain.",
      "question": "Does the ridge maintain its original undulating shape, forming a continuous elevated backbone from foreground to background?",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The surrounding greenery—trees, shrubs, and grass—forms the natural context. Their distribution and density define the environment. The instruction only modifies the path, not the vegetation. Preserving these ensures the dragon integrates naturally into the existing world rather than floating above it.",
      "question": "Are the trees and shrubs on the slopes of the ridge still present in their original locations and densities?",

      "thinking_process": "The overcast sky contributes to the mood and lighting. It is a background element not targeted for change. Retaining it ensures consistent illumination and atmospheric continuity. Changing it would alter the time of day or weather, affecting the overall coherence.",
      "question": "Is the sky still uniformly overcast with soft, diffused lighting, matching the original tone?",

      "thinking_process": "The grassy terrain flanking the path is a key detail that distinguishes the path from its surroundings. Its color and texture (green grass vs. orange soil) are crucial for contrast and realism. While the path changes, the adjacent grass must remain unchanged to maintain visual separation and ecological plausibility.",
      "question": "Are the grassy areas on both sides of the path still green and undisturbed, retaining their original texture and color?",
