Description of reference image: The subject is a female snowboarder in mid-action, crouched low on a snowboard, carving through deep powder snow. She wears a rust-orange insulated jacket with visible zippers and seam lines, black snow pants, black gloves, and a black helmet with red-tinted ski goggles reflecting the snowy environment. Her long brown hair flows behind her to the left side, indicating motion. The snowboard is partially visible beneath her feet, angled slightly to the right, kicking up a spray of snow. The background consists of a dense forest of tall, snow-laden evergreen trees (likely fir or spruce), symmetrically arranged and covered in thick white snow, creating a serene winter landscape. The sky is overcast, pale gray-white, contributing to soft, diffused lighting. The ground is uniformly blanketed in untouched snow, with subtle texture from wind drifts and snowboard tracks. The composition centers the figure slightly off-center to the right, emphasizing forward momentum.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions for explicit changes allowed. The instruction specifies transforming the original image into a collection of 9 Chibi-style stickers in a 3x3 layout, with a transparent background, square aspect ratio, and consistent Ghibli-inspired cartoon aesthetic. This implies that the **subject’s form, proportions, clothing, and scene** are to be reinterpreted in a stylized cartoon format. However, the instruction does not state that the **identity of the character** or **core visual traits** should be altered—only that the style and context are to change. Therefore, elements such as **gender, hairstyle, clothing color, equipment (helmet, goggles, snowboard), and action pose** may be stylized but must remain recognizable. The **background environment** (snowy forest) is referenced in the instruction ("evokes winter and snowy landscapes") and thus must be preserved in spirit, though not necessarily in realism. The instruction allows for **new actions and emotions**, so dynamic poses can vary across stickers, but the **character's core identity** must persist.

Allowed Changes List:
- Subject’s form and proportions (to be stylized into Chibi format)
- Clothing details (e.g., simplified seams, exaggerated features)
- Background scenery (replaced with stylized snowy landscape elements)
- Pose and expression (varied across stickers to reflect different moods)
- Color palette (adjusted to vibrant, cartoonish tones)
- Composition (arranged in 3x3 grid with transparent background)
- Presence of snowboard (must remain, but can be stylized)
- Hair flow and movement (can be exaggerated for animation effect)
- Lighting and shadows (replaced with flat, cartoon lighting)

Step 2- Determine the elements that should remain unchanged

Thinking process:
Core recognition elements: The original image features a human subject engaged in snowboarding. While the style will change, the **identity of the character** must remain intact. Key recognition features include: **female gender**, **long brown hair**, **rust-orange jacket**, **black helmet with red-tinted goggles**, **black snow pants**, **gloves**, and **snowboard**. These are essential for identifying the character across the sticker set. The **presence of snowboarding gear** is critical—without it, the character would not be recognizable as a snowboarder. The **color of the jacket (rust-orange)** is a distinctive identifier; changing it arbitrarily could misrepresent the character. The **goggles’ red tint** is a unique detail that reflects the environment and adds visual signature.

Functional/logical association elements: The **snowboard** is functionally tied to the action—removing or altering it would break the logical connection between the character and the activity. The **position of the snowboard under the feet** must be preserved to maintain the action logic. The **motion of the hair** indicates direction and speed, which supports the dynamic nature of snowboarding and should be retained in some form.

Non modified element deduction: After excluding allowed changes (style, proportion, background, pose variation), the remaining **visual identifiers** that define the character’s identity must be preserved. These include the **hair color and length**, **jacket color**, **goggles**, **helmet**, **clothing type**, and **equipment**. Even if stylized, these must remain visually consistent enough to ensure continuity across the sticker series.

Preservation Targets List:
- Female gender
- Long brown hair
- Rust-orange jacket
- Black helmet with red-tinted goggles
- Black snow pants
- Black gloves
- Snowboard under feet
- Character fully present in each sticker (no partial cropping)
- Winter/snowy environment theme (in spirit, via stylized elements)

Q1:  
Thinking process: The rust-orange color of the jacket is a key visual identifier in the original image. It distinguishes the character from the surrounding white snow and dark trees, making it a core recognition feature. In the edited version, even if stylized, this color must be preserved to maintain character consistency. If replaced with another hue, the character would no longer be visually identifiable as the same individual. This is a high-weight element because it is a primary distinguishing trait.
Question: Is the character wearing a rust-orange jacket?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The presence of the snowboard under the character’s feet is essential to the action and identity. Without it, the character cannot be recognized as a snowboarder. The snowboard’s position and function are central to the scene’s logic. Even in Chibi form, the board must be visible and correctly placed beneath the feet to preserve the action’s integrity.
Question: Is the snowboard positioned under the character’s feet?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The black helmet with red-tinted goggles is a distinctive accessory that contributes to the character’s identity. The red tint reflects the snowy environment and is a unique visual cue. Changing the color or removing the goggles would alter the character’s appearance significantly. This combination is a key identifier and must be preserved in the stylized version.
Question: Does the character wear a black helmet with red-tinted goggles?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The long brown hair flowing behind the character indicates motion and adds to the dynamic feel of the scene. It is a defining physical trait that helps identify the character. In the Chibi version, while the style may be simplified, the hair must remain long and brown to maintain visual continuity.
Question: Does the character have long brown hair?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The character is wearing black snow pants, which are part of the standard snowboarding attire and help distinguish her from the background. While the style may be simplified, the color and type of pants must remain consistent to preserve the character’s outfit identity. Changing the color or replacing them with different pants would disrupt the visual coherence.
Question: Are the character’s pants black?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The character is fully visible in the original image, with no parts cropped out. The instruction requires that each sticker shows the character “complete,” meaning no limbs or body parts should be missing. This ensures consistency across the sticker set and maintains the character’s full form.
Question: Is the character fully visible in the image, with no body parts cut off?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The gloves are part of the character’s winter gear and contribute to the overall outfit. They are small but important details that help complete the snowboarding look. Removing or changing their color would affect the authenticity of the character’s appearance.
Question: Does the character wear black gloves?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q8:  
Thinking process: The background is a snowy forest with evergreen trees, which sets the winter scene. While the instruction allows for stylization, the theme of a snowy landscape must be preserved. The presence of snow-covered trees in the background is essential to evoke the winter setting required by the instruction.
Question: Are there snow-covered evergreen trees in the background?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2
