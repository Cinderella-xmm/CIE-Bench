      "thinking_process": "The atomic symbol's structure — specifically the three elliptical orbits intersecting at a central nucleus with three distinct electron positions — is the core identity feature of the image. This stylized atomic model is not generic; its specific configuration (three orbits, symmetrical layout, electron dots) defines the subject’s theme. Changing this would make the design unrecognizable as the same atomic motif, undermining the conceptual basis of the image. Therefore, this is a key element with weight 3.",
      "question": "Does the atomic design retain the three intersecting elliptical orbits with a central nucleus and three electron positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The white plastic cookie cutter is the functional object that creates the atomic imprint. Its shape is identical to the atomic design, making it essential for maintaining the logic of the scene. If the cutter’s form is altered, the relationship between tool and result breaks down. Since the instruction does not allow changing the cutter’s shape, it must remain intact. This is a key functional element, thus weighted 3.",
      "question": "Is the white plastic cookie cutter retaining its original atomic-shaped outline with three elliptical loops and a central nucleus?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The relative positioning of the cutter and the dough imprint — specifically, the cutter placed to the left of the dough with partial overlap — establishes spatial continuity and suggests the action of pressing the cutter into the dough. This layout is critical for visual storytelling. Although the dough may be replaced, the positional relationship must be preserved to maintain coherence. This is a key compositional element, hence weighted 2.",
      "question": "Is the cookie cutter positioned to the left of the atomic imprint, with a partial edge overlap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The clean, continuous line quality of the atomic imprint in the dough — particularly the sharp, unbroken edges of the orbits and electron holes — indicates precision and reflects the cutter’s fidelity. This detail supports the realism of the cutting process. Altering this (e.g., blurry edges, broken lines) would suggest poor execution or a different method, damaging consistency. Though secondary, it is a necessary detail for authenticity, so weighted 2.",
      "question": "Does the atomic imprint in the dough have clean, continuous edges without breaks or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The central hole in the nucleus area of the atomic design is a distinctive feature — it represents the nucleus and distinguishes this atomic model from other star-like shapes. Its presence confirms the design's scientific intent. Removing or altering this hole would misrepresent the atomic structure. This is a minor but identifying detail, so weighted 1.",
      "question": "Is there a small central hole in the nucleus area of the atomic imprint?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
