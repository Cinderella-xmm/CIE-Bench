Description of reference image: The subject is a large stone statue of a male figure, likely representing Jesus Christ, standing upright with arms outstretched horizontally to the sides. The figure is depicted in a long, flowing robe that drapes from the shoulders down to the base of the statue, forming vertical folds along the front. The head is slightly tilted upward and to the left, with a beard and hair visible beneath a hooded garment. The facial features are carved with moderate detail—eyes closed or looking upward, nose prominent, lips gently parted. The hands are open, palms facing forward, fingers slightly curved. The material appears to be granite or similar stone, with a rough, textured surface showing natural grain and weathering. The background is a clear, pale blue sky with no clouds or other elements, indicating an outdoor setting under daylight conditions. The perspective is low-angle, emphasizing the height and grandeur of the statue.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions word by word:  
- "Reimagine the statue as a ukiyo-e artwork" → indicates a complete stylistic transformation, allowing changes in artistic medium, color palette, and composition style.  
- "Flatten the robes into flowing patterned cloth using indigo and gold" → specifies modification of the robe’s texture, form, and color; thus, the original stone texture and three-dimensional draping can be altered.  
- "Emphasize the arms with calligraphic lines" → allows reworking of arm shape and line quality, suggesting stylization beyond realistic anatomy.  
- "Render the figure's face in soft, serene outlines" → implies simplification and abstraction of facial features, so original sculptural details may be reduced.  
- "Replace sky with stylized, wave-like clouds for an ethereal atmosphere" → explicitly replaces the background environment, meaning the original sky must be removed.  

Thus, the allowed changes include:
- Material and texture of the robe (stone → flat patterned cloth)
- Color of the robe (gray stone → indigo and gold)
- Style of the arms (realistic → calligraphic lines)
- Facial rendering (detailed carving → soft outlines)
- Background (clear blue sky → stylized wave-like clouds)

Allowed Changes List:  
(Specific element 1 that allows for changes): The texture and material of the robe (from stone to flat, patterned fabric)  
(Specific element 2 that allows for changes): The color of the robe (from grayish-brown stone to indigo and gold)  
(Specific element 3 that allows for changes): The form and line treatment of the arms (from anatomically accurate to calligraphic)  
(Specific element 4 that allows for changes): The facial features (from detailed stone carving to soft, serene outlines)  
(Specific element 5 that allows for changes): The background sky (from clear blue to stylized wave-like clouds)

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements: The statue is identifiable as a religious figure (Jesus Christ) based on its iconic posture—arms outstretched, head raised, draped robe—and the specific gesture associated with the "Christ the Redeemer" type statues. While the style will change, the **identity** of the figure must remain recognizable. Therefore, key identity-preserving elements such as the **outstretched arms**, **upward gaze**, and **long robe** must retain their fundamental forms, even if stylized. These are not merely decorative but essential to the symbolic representation.

Functional/logical association elements: The **pose**—arms extended sideways—is central to the figure’s function as a symbol of embrace, blessing, or redemption. Changing this would alter the symbolic meaning. Thus, the **arm position** (horizontal extension) and **head tilt** (upward and slightly left) must remain logically consistent, even if rendered differently.

Non-modified element deduction: Elements not mentioned in the instructions for change—such as the **presence of the beard**, **hooded garment**, **open palms**, and **vertical folds in the robe**—should be retained unless directly contradicted. Even though the robe will be flattened and patterned, the **structure of the robe** (e.g., full-length, covering torso and legs) and **overall silhouette** must persist to preserve identity. Similarly, the **hands being open and palms forward** is a key symbolic gesture that should not be lost.

Preservation Targets List:  
(The figure’s arms are extended horizontally to both sides)  
(The figure’s head is tilted upward and slightly to the left)  
(The figure has a beard and hair beneath a hooded garment)  
(The figure’s hands are open with palms facing forward)  
(The robe covers the entire body from shoulders to base, forming vertical folds)  
(The statue stands upright in a frontal pose, viewed from a low angle)

    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The outstretched arms are a core identifying feature of this statue, directly tied to its religious symbolism and public recognition. In the original image, both arms extend horizontally to the sides, forming a T-shape. This pose is iconic and distinguishes it from other statues. Even if stylized into calligraphic lines, the horizontal extension must be preserved to maintain the figure’s identity. Loss of this posture would fundamentally alter the statue’s meaning and recognition.
    Question: Are both arms extended horizontally to the sides, forming a symmetrical T-shape?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The head tilt upward and slightly to the left is a distinctive pose that contributes to the figure’s contemplative and divine expression. It is a key visual cue in identifying the statue as Christ the Redeemer-type figures. Although the facial features may be softened, the direction of the head must remain unchanged to preserve the intended emotional and symbolic tone. Altering this would misrepresent the figure’s orientation and intent.
    Question: Is the head tilted upward and slightly toward the left side of the frame?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The presence of a beard and hair beneath a hooded garment is a defining characteristic of the figure’s identity as Jesus Christ. This feature is consistently present in such religious statues and is essential for recognition. Even if the facial details are simplified, the beard and hood must remain to preserve the figure’s identity. Removing them would make the figure unrecognizable.
    Question: Does the figure have a beard and hair covered by a hooded garment?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3

{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The open palms with fingers slightly curved are a symbolic gesture of blessing or welcome, central to the statue’s meaning. In the original image, both hands are clearly open, palms forward. This gesture is not just aesthetic but functional in conveying the figure’s message. Even if stylized, the openness of the palms must be preserved to maintain the symbolic integrity.
    Question: Are both hands open with palms facing forward?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The robe covers the entire body from shoulders to base and features vertical folds, which define its silhouette and structure. This full-length drape is essential to the figure’s appearance and helps distinguish it from other types of statues. While the texture and color may change, the overall form and coverage must remain to preserve the original shape and identity.
    Question: Does the robe cover the entire body from shoulders to the base of the statue, with vertical folds running down the front?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The statue is positioned upright in a frontal pose, viewed from a low angle, which emphasizes its height and dominance. This perspective is crucial for conveying the statue’s grandeur and is part of the original image’s composition. While the background may be replaced, the low-angle view and frontal stance must remain to preserve the spatial relationship and viewer experience.
    Question: Is the statue shown in a frontal pose, viewed from a low angle looking upward?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
