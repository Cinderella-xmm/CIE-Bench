Description of reference image: The subject consists of a young girl and a man at a skate park. The girl is wearing a black helmet, elbow pads, knee pads, and a striped dress while standing next to a skateboard. The man beside her is wearing a turquoise cap, sunglasses, a green T-shirt, and dark shorts. He is also standing near a skateboard. Both individuals are leaning against a metal railing. In the background, there is a large white and blue tent, a skate ramp, and several spectators. The sky above is cloudy.

Thinking process:  
The editing instructions specify transforming the image into a Swiss Design poster with a strong asymmetrical layout, simplified shapes, restricted color palette, and integration of text. This means the human figures and background tent can be simplified into flat graphic shapes, and colors can be restricted. However, the core identity of the subjects (the girl and the man), their relative positions, and the skateboarding context must be retained. The background tent and skate ramp should also be simplified but still recognizable.

Allowed Changes List:  
Specific element 1 that allows for changes: Simplification of human figures into flat graphic shapes.  
Specific element 2 that allows for changes: Simplification of the background tent and skate ramp into flat graphic shapes.  
Specific element 3 that allows for changes: Restriction of colors to blues, whites, and the man's green shirt.  

Step 2 - Determine the elements that should remain unchanged  
Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements include the distinct postures of the girl and the man, their skateboards, and the skate park setting. Functional/logical association elements include their relative positions and the presence of skateboarding equipment. Remaining elements like the cloudy sky and the tent's general shape contribute to visual coherence.

Preservation Targets List:  
(Element 1 that should be maintained: The girl's posture and her proximity to the skateboard)  
(Element 2 that should be maintained: The man's posture and his proximity to the skateboard)  
(Element 3 that should be maintained: The relative positioning of the girl and the man)  
(Element 4 that should be maintained: The presence of skateboards)  
(Element 5 that should be maintained: The general shape and placement of the tent)

Q1:  
Thinking process: The girl's posture and proximity to the skateboard are key identifiers of her involvement in skateboarding. Losing this would make it unclear what activity she is engaged in.  
Question: Is the girl depicted in a posture that suggests she is interacting with the skateboard?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The man's posture and proximity to the skateboard similarly indicate his involvement in the activity.  
Question: Is the man depicted in a posture that suggests he is interacting with the skateboard?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The relative positioning of the girl and the man is crucial for maintaining the scene's logical coherence.  
Question: Are the girl and the man positioned next to each other, leaning against the railing?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The presence of skateboards is essential for identifying the activity taking place.  
Question: Are both skateboards visible in the image?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The general shape and placement of the tent provide context for the skate park setting.  
Question: Is the general shape and placement of the tent preserved in the background?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1
