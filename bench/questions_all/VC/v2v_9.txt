### Step 1 - Description of Reference Image and Allowed Changes List:

**Description of Reference Image:**  
The subject is a stylized illustration of a purple bubble tea drink. It has a clear dome lid, a purple straw, and a cup filled with a purple liquid and tapioca pearls. The cup has a cute face with eyes represented by yellow stars and a smiling mouth. The background is plain white, and there are purple sparkles around the cup.

**Thinking Process:**  
The instructions aim to transform this bubble tea into a fantasy creature while retaining certain elements. The transformation involves designing a full-body creature, adding a custom orb/capsule, naming the creature, and assigning an elemental type. The scene can be changed to fit a fantasy setting, but the core elements of the bubble tea must be retained.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
- The shape of the subject can be transformed into a creature.
- The scene can be changed to a fantasy setting.
- Additional elements like a custom orb/capsule, name, and elemental type can be added.
- Proportions, angles, and details can be adjusted to fit the new creature design.

### Step 2 - Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged:

**Thinking Process:**  
Core recognition elements include the purple color palette, the tapioca pearls, the straw, and the cup's glossy finish. Functional/logical elements include the relationship between the tapioca pearls and the liquid, and the straw's insertion into the cup. Remaining elements like the cute face and sparkles contribute to the overall charm and should be retained for visual coherence.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
- Purple color palette

- Straw  
- Glossy finish of the cup
