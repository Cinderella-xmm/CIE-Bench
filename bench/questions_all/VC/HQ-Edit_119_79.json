      "thinking_process": "The calico pattern is the defining feature of this cat, consisting of distinct orange, black, and white patches in a non-uniform distribution. This pattern is crucial for species and individual identification. If the crystal transformation alters the patch locations or colors (e.g., swapping orange for red), the cat loses its identity. Thus, preserving the exact layout of these colors is essential. The instruction specifies retaining the pattern using obsidian accents, confirming the need to maintain the original distribution.",
      "question": "Is the calico pattern of orange, black, and white patches preserved in the same spatial arrangement across the cat’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The green eyes are a key identifying trait of this cat. They are centrally located, large, and vivid in the original image. The instruction specifies crafting them from emerald crystals, which implies the color and position must remain unchanged. Altering eye color or moving them would fundamentally change the subject’s appearance and recognition.",
      "question": "Are the eyes still green and positioned symmetrically in the center of the face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The cat is seated upright with its front paws together and body balanced on the wooden post. This posture is critical for maintaining the original composition and intent. The instruction requires the cat to remain seated atop the block, so any deviation (e.g., lying down or crouching) would violate the structural logic of the edit. Preserving this pose ensures continuity.",
      "question": "Is the cat in an upright seated position with both front paws placed directly in front of the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The pink nose and white muzzle are distinctive facial features that contribute to the cat’s identity. The instruction does not mention changing these, and since they are part of the original face structure, they must be retained even if rendered in crystal. Losing the pink nose or replacing the white muzzle with another color would misrepresent the subject.",
      "question": "Is the pink nose present at the center of the face, surrounded by white fur on the muzzle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The wooden block supports the cat and is explicitly required to remain. Although the instruction describes it as “polished,” the original block has a rough, weathered texture with visible grain. While surface finish may change, the block’s presence, vertical orientation, and position beneath the cat must be preserved. Removing or relocating it would disrupt the scene’s logic.",
      "question": "Is the cat seated on a vertical wooden block that supports its full weight?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The cat’s tail is curled slightly to the right, with alternating orange and black bands matching the calico pattern. This specific tail shape and coloration are part of the original design. Even in crystal form, the tail’s curvature and banding must be preserved to maintain consistency with the body pattern and overall identity.",
      "question": "Is the tail curled to the right side and displaying alternating orange and black bands consistent with the body pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The ears are pointed upward and symmetrically placed on the head. Their shape and position are key to the cat’s alert expression. The instruction does not allow modification of head structure, so ear shape and orientation must remain. Changing them would affect the facial expression and recognition.",
      "question": "Are both ears upright and pointed forward, symmetrically placed on the top of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q8",
      "thinking_process": "The cat’s chest is fluffy and white, forming a prominent bib-like area. This detail contributes to the softness and character of the original image. While the material may change to crystal, the volume and position of the white chest fur must be preserved to maintain visual fidelity.",
      "question": "Is there a large white fluffy area on the chest extending from the neck down to the front paws?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
