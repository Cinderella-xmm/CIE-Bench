      "thinking_process": "The handheld fan is the central prop that enables the humorous twist of using technology instead of breath to blow out candles. Its presence and function are essential to the scene’s identity. The key identifying feature is the **circular black fan with visible blades and a handle**, held in the right hand. This specific object is not just a tool but a symbol of resourcefulness. If this fan is replaced with another object (e.g., a leaf, a paper fan), the core joke is lost. Therefore, the fan’s **form and function** must be preserved, even if stylized. The question focuses on whether the fan is still present and used in the same way, which is a core identity element.",

      "thinking_process": "The candles are the target of the action and represent the birthday celebration. Their **number (seven)** and **color pattern (yellow, pink, blue, white)** are visually distinctive and contribute to the scene’s specificity. The **flames and smoke** indicate they were just extinguished, which is critical to the narrative. Even if stylized, the candles must retain their **vertical alignment** and **function as the source of smoke**. Losing this would break the logical sequence of events.",

      "thinking_process": "The smoke rising from the candles is a key indicator that the candles were just blown out. It provides visual proof of the action’s success and ties the fan’s use to the result. Without smoke, the scene loses its dynamic and causal logic. The **presence of wispy white smoke** above the candles is a non-negotiable detail that confirms the moment captured in the image.",

This **facial expression and body language** establish the comedic effort involved. Even in a cartoon style, the **direction of the gaze and the open mouth** must remain consistent to preserve the narrative. This is a functional element that supports the logic of the scene.",

While the table and plate may be stylized, their **relative positions** must be preserved to maintain the scene’s coherence.
