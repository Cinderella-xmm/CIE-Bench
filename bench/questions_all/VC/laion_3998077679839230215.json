      "thinking_process": "The deep purple color and silver floral embroidery on the blouse are the defining visual features that distinguish it from other garments. The embroidery includes a symmetrical pattern concentrated around the neckline and chest area, forming a recognizable decorative motif. In the chibi-style magnet, this must be preserved to maintain identity. Losing the purple base or replacing the silver embroidery with another color or pattern would make the blouse unrecognizable. Therefore, this is a core identification feature with high weight.",

      "thinking_process": "The lehenga’s flared shape and vertical silver paisley motifs are iconic to its design. These patterns are repeated down the front and sides, creating a distinctive visual rhythm. The red lining visible at the hem is also a key detail that differentiates it from plain purple lehengas. Altering the pattern or removing the red trim would compromise its identity. Thus, this is a critical visual element.",

      "thinking_process": "The red dupatta with a silver zari border is a signature accessory in this outfit. Its long, flowing shape and the contrast between the red fabric and silver trim are essential for recognition. The small star-like embroidery scattered across it adds detail. If the dupatta were shown without the border or in a different color, it would no longer match the original.",

      "thinking_process": "The traditional jewelry, particularly the maang tikka and earrings, are culturally significant and visually prominent. The maang tikka is centered on the forehead with intricate detailing, and the earrings are long and pearl-accented. These are not just accessories but key identifiers of the outfit’s ceremonial nature. Removing or simplifying them would undermine the authenticity.",
      "question": "Are the jewelry pieces including a central maang tikka and dangling earrings with pearls present?",

      "thinking_process": "The silver bangles on the right wrist are a clear, identifiable detail. Their layered structure and metallic shine contribute to the overall aesthetic. They are positioned distinctly on the forearm and are not interchangeable with other types of bracelets. Omitting them or changing their material would alter the accuracy of the representation.",

It features a damask-style texture in golden-brown tones with repeating floral motifs. This pattern provides context and enhances the richness of the scene. While less central than the clothing, it is still a required component of the transformation. Its absence or replacement would break the intended visual continuity.",
