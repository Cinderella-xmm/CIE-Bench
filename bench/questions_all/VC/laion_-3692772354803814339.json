It is a unique, legally protected trademark and the primary means by which consumers recognize the brand. Even if stylized into golden maritime symbols, its presence and legibility must be preserved to maintain brand identity. Losing it would render the product unidentifiable as Laphroaig. Therefore, this is a core recognition element with maximum weight.",

The instruction says the label becomes \"intricate golden maritime symbols,\" but since \"PX CASK\" is a key descriptor, it must still be visually represented in some form (e.g., through symbol or text). Its absence would misrepresent the product. This is a high-priority element for product recognition.",
