      "thinking_process": "The V-shaped dual-wing silhouette is the most iconic and defining feature of the building, responsible for its unique architectural identity. It is the primary visual cue that distinguishes this structure from others. If this shape is altered or obscured, the building cannot be recognized as the same original structure, even under transformation. Therefore, preserving this silhouette is critical for maintaining the reference integrity of the image.",
      "question": "Is the V-shaped dual-wing silhouette of the building preserved in the edited version?",

      "thinking_process": "The stacked, modular arrangement of floors forms the backbone of the building’s structure. Each floor follows a consistent pattern of windows and balconies, creating a rhythmic vertical progression. This repetition is essential for identifying the building’s architectural style and scale. Changing this arrangement would disrupt the structural logic and make the transformation appear arbitrary.",
      "question": "Are the floors stacked in a consistent, repeating modular pattern from bottom to top?",

      "thinking_process": "The horizontal alignment of windows and balconies across each level is a key detail that maintains the building’s orderly design. This alignment ensures visual balance and reinforces the grid-based layout. If windows or balconies are misaligned or repositioned, the coherence of the original structure is compromised, even if mechanical elements are added.",
      "question": "Are the windows and balconies aligned horizontally on each floor?",

      "thinking_process": "The symmetrical positioning of the two wings around a central axis is a fundamental aspect of the building’s design. This symmetry contributes to its aesthetic balance and architectural harmony. Altering this symmetry would distort the original form and break the intended visual relationship between the wings.",
      "question": "Are the two wings of the building symmetrically positioned relative to the central vertical axis?",

      "thinking_process": "The yellow awnings on the balconies are a distinctive color feature that adds visual rhythm and contrast to the otherwise neutral facade. Their presence and placement are consistent across multiple levels, contributing to the building’s identity. While the instruction allows transformation of balconies into arms, it does not specify removal of the awnings, so their original position should be preserved unless integrated into the mechanical design.",

      "thinking_process": "The clear separation between window sections and balcony overhangs defines the building’s layered depth and structural clarity. This separation creates a distinct visual hierarchy and prevents confusion between functional zones. Losing this distinction would blur the architectural details and reduce the recognizability of the original form.",
      "question": "Is there a visible separation between the window openings and the projecting balcony overhangs on each floor?",
