Description of reference image: The subject is a stack of two fluffy, golden-yellow pancakes with a slightly browned top surface and a soft, porous interior texture. The pancakes are placed on a white ceramic plate with a light blue rim. On the top pancake rests a rectangular pat of pale yellow butter, which is melting slightly due to heat. A clear glass pitcher containing amber-colored syrup is being tilted above the stack, pouring syrup in a thin stream that cascades down the side of the pancakes. The background includes a blurred wooden table surface, a white cloth napkin to the right, and green eucalyptus leaves in the upper left corner, adding a natural, bright morning ambiance. Natural daylight illuminates the scene, enhancing the warm tones of the food and creating soft highlights on the syrup and butter.

Thinking process:  
First, analyze the editing instructions for explicit changes:  
- The instruction explicitly transforms the **pancake stack into anthropomorphic characters** (two cheerful pancake siblings), so the **form and identity of the pancakes as food items can be changed**.  
- The **butter pat becomes a hat**, so its function and placement may change but its **presence as a solid yellow block** might still be retained visually.  
- The **syrup becomes a heroic cape**, implying transformation of its role and flow pattern, though it remains a liquid element.  
- The **scene is reimagined** into a whimsical comic strip with breakfast foods like coffee cups and scrambled eggs added, meaning **background elements are not required to be preserved**.  
- The **style shifts to cartoonish, exaggerated, vibrant art**, allowing full transformation of visual realism.  

Thus, allowed changes include:  
- Transformation of pancakes into anthropomorphic characters  
- Reinterpretation of butter as a hat  
- Reinterpretation of syrup as a cape  
- Addition of new breakfast-themed elements (coffee cup, eggs)  
- Change in artistic style (realistic → cartoon)  
- Modification or removal of background elements (e.g., eucalyptus, table, napkin)

Allowed Changes List:  
- Form and identity of pancakes (from food to characters)  
- Function and positioning of butter (from topping to hat)  
- Flow and symbolic use of syrup (from drizzle to cape)  
- Background environment (from real kitchen setting to comic panel)  
- Artistic style (from photorealistic to cartoony)  
- Presence and arrangement of non-core props (e.g., eucalyptus, napkin, table)

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements:  
- The **stacked pancake structure** is central to the original subject. Even if anthropomorphized, the **two-layered vertical stack** must retain its core form to remain recognizable as pancakes. While shape may be exaggerated, the **vertical stacking of two round, fluffy layers** is essential.  
- The **golden-yellow color** of the pancakes is a key identifier—this hue differentiates them from other breakfast foods. It should remain dominant even in stylization.  
- The **presence of butter** is specified in the original image and mentioned in the edit (as a hat). Its **solid rectangular shape and pale yellow color** are distinctive enough to be retained even if repurposed.  
- The **syrup’s amber color and liquid nature** are critical—it flows visibly and is a defining feature of the breakfast scene. Though transformed into a "cape," its **liquid texture and golden tone** must be preserved.  

Functional/logical association elements:  
- The **flow of syrup from pitcher to pancakes** establishes a functional relationship—this action is implied in the edit (syrup as cape), so the **source and direction of syrup flow** should be maintained logically.  
- The **positioning of butter on top** is significant—it's not just a topping but a focal point. In the comic, it becomes a hat, so its **placement on the uppermost pancake** must be preserved.  

Non-modified element deduction:  
- The **texture of the pancakes** (porous, airy interior visible at edges) is a unique detail that distinguishes them from flat cakes or muffins. This should be retained even if exaggerated.  
- The **plate’s white color with blue rim** is a minor but identifiable element. Since no instruction mentions changing the plate, and it anchors the composition, it should be preserved.  
- The **color contrast between yellow pancakes, white plate, and amber syrup** contributes to visual coherence and should be maintained.  

Preservation Targets List:  
- Two stacked pancake layers with vertical alignment  
- Golden-yellow color of pancakes  
- Rectangular pat of pale yellow butter on top pancake  
- Amber-colored syrup flowing from pitcher  
- White plate with light blue rim  
- Porous, fluffy texture of pancake interior  
- Direction of syrup flow from pitcher to top pancake

    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The stacked structure of two pancakes is the core identity feature—without this, the subject would not be recognizable as pancakes. The vertical alignment and relative size difference between the two layers are essential for identifying the stack. Even in cartoon form, this configuration must be preserved to maintain recognition. This is a 3-point element because it defines the subject.
    Question: Are there two vertically stacked pancake layers, with the bottom one slightly larger than the top?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The golden-yellow color of the pancakes is a key visual identifier distinguishing them from other breakfast foods. Even in a whimsical style, the dominant yellow hue must remain to preserve the pancake identity. Losing this color would make the subject unrecognizable as pancakes. This is a 3-point element due to its role in core identification.
    Question: Do the pancakes retain a dominant golden-yellow color throughout their visible surfaces?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The rectangular pat of butter is a distinct object in the original image, positioned centrally on the top pancake. Its presence and shape are crucial for continuity—even when reimagined as a hat, its form must be traceable. Removing or altering its shape would break visual consistency with the source.
    Question: Is there a solid, rectangular pat of pale yellow butter placed on the top pancake?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The syrup is shown as an amber-colored liquid being poured from a pitcher. Its color and fluid motion are key features. Even when transformed into a "cape," the syrup must retain its golden hue and liquid state to maintain logical continuity. Loss of color or texture would disrupt the connection to the original.
    Question: Is there a visible stream of amber-colored syrup flowing from a pitcher onto the pancakes?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The white plate with a light blue rim is a consistent environmental anchor. Though the background may change, the plate serves as a base and provides visual framing. Its presence ensures the scene remains grounded in the original context. Altering its color or removing it would affect compositional coherence.
    Question: Is the pancake stack placed on a white plate with a light blue rim?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The porous, fluffy texture of the pancake interiors, especially visible at the edges, is a distinctive detail that separates these pancakes from denser baked goods. This texture contributes to their realistic appearance and should be preserved even in stylized form to maintain authenticity.
    Question: Are the inner sides of the pancakes visibly porous and airy, showing a spongy texture?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}
{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The direction of syrup flow—from the pitcher above to the top pancake—is a functional and dynamic element. Even in a comic, the syrup must originate from above and flow downward to maintain logical continuity. Reversing or omitting this flow would misrepresent the original action.
    Question: Does the syrup stream originate from above the stack and flow downward onto the top pancake?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
