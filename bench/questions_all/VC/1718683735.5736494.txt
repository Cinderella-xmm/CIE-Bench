Description of reference image:  
The subject is a seated male figure dressed in an 18th-century-style military or naval uniform, reminiscent of historical figures such as George Washington. He wears a dark blue coat with gold trim and multiple rows of ornate gold buttons arranged vertically along the front. The coat features elaborate gold epaulettes on the shoulders and decorative gold piping along the edges. A white ruffled cravat is visible at the neck, extending over the chest. The figure has powdered white hair styled in a classic wig with curls framing the face, and he wears a black tricorne hat with a light-colored (likely straw or beige) brim edge. His posture is relaxed, sitting cross-legged on a tree stump or log, surrounded by golden coins scattered across his lap and piled in a wooden bowl beside him. Additional gold coins are suspended from tree branches above, forming a whimsical, treasure-laden scene. The background consists of blurred green foliage and tree trunks, suggesting an outdoor woodland setting. The lighting is natural daylight, casting soft shadows and highlighting the metallic sheen of the gold coins.

Thinking process:  
First, analyze the editing instructions word by word to determine what can be changed. The instruction states: “Transform the seated figure into a chibi-style figurine resembling a pirate captain, emphasizing the tricorne hat and detailed coat.” This indicates that the **form** of the figure will change—specifically, it will be stylized into a chibi (small, exaggerated cartoonish) version. However, the instruction emphasizes retaining the **tricorne hat** and **detailed coat**, which implies these elements must remain visually identifiable despite the style transformation.  

Next, the instruction specifies: “Portray the figure as holding a miniature treasure chest with exaggerated, sparkling gold coins spilling out.” This means the **object held** changes from loose coins to a treasure chest, so the original action of handling individual coins is replaced. Thus, the **original object interaction** (handing coins) is no longer required.  

Then: “Base the figurine on a stylized wooden pirate ship deck, adorned with tiny daggers and nautical motifs for a whimsical maritime theme.” This clearly replaces the **scene environment**—the original woodland setting with tree stumps and foliage is to be replaced with a pirate ship deck. Therefore, the **background environment** is not preserved.  

However, since the instruction says "emphasizing the tricorne hat and detailed coat," these are explicitly highlighted as key features to retain. This suggests they must be recognizable even in chibi form. No mention is made of changing the **color scheme** of the coat (blue with gold trim), nor the **structure** of the tricorne hat. Hence, while the **proportion**, **scale**, and **style** of the figure may change, its **core visual identity markers** must persist.  

Allowed Changes List:  
- The overall form and scale of the figure (transformed into chibi style)  
- The object being held (from loose coins to treasure chest)  
- The background environment (from woodland to pirate ship deck)  
- The posture and positioning (adjusted for chibi proportions)  
- The presence and arrangement of gold coins (now spilling from a chest, not scattered freely)  
- The texture and material representation (e.g., real fabric vs. cartoon rendering)  
- The facial expression and details (may be simplified or exaggerated)  

Step 2 – Determine the elements that should remain unchanged  
Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements: The tricorne hat and the detailed coat are explicitly mentioned in the instruction as features to emphasize. These are not just accessories but **iconic identifiers** of the historical character’s identity. The tricorne hat, especially with its black color and beige-trimmed brim, is a distinctive symbol of 18th-century military leadership. The coat’s blue base with gold buttons and trim is a signature element of formal naval or military dress of the era. Changing their **presence**, **shape**, or **color** would undermine the intended identity linkage. Even in chibi form, these must remain recognizable.  

Functional/logical association elements: The figure’s **clothing structure** (e.g., the button layout, collar shape, sleeve design) supports the identification of rank and role. While the pose and object may change, the **functional logic** of the uniform remains tied to the character’s identity. If the coat were drastically altered in silhouette or color, it could misrepresent the historical archetype.  

Non-modified element deduction: After excluding allowed changes (form, object, background), the remaining elements that must be retained are those that define the **visual identity** of the original subject. These include:  
- The **tricorne hat’s shape and color contrast** (black with beige trim)  
- The **coat’s color palette** (dark blue with gold accents)  
- The **button pattern** (multiple rows of gold buttons)  
- The **white ruffled cravat** (as part of the formal attire)  
- The **powdered white wig** (distinctive hairstyle)  

These are not mentioned as changeable in the instruction and are essential for maintaining the **historical likeness** of the figure, even if stylized. They are not optional; they are core to the subject’s recognition.  

Preservation Targets List:  
- Tricorne hat with black crown and beige-trimmed brim  
- Dark blue coat with gold buttons and trim  
- White ruffled cravat at the neck  
- Powdered white wig with curled ends  
- Gold coin color and reflective surface (in context of treasure)  

Q1:  
Thinking process: The tricorne hat is a defining feature of the historical figure’s identity. Its shape—a three-cornered hat with a distinct brim—and the color contrast between the black crown and beige trim are unique identifiers. In chibi style, even if simplified, the basic triangular form and color division must remain to preserve recognition. Loss of this would make the character unidentifiable as a historical naval/military leader. Therefore, it is a core identity element.  
Question: Does the figure wear a tricorne hat with a black crown and beige-trimmed brim?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The dark blue coat with gold buttons and trim is central to the figure’s authoritative appearance. The specific arrangement of gold buttons in multiple rows is a functional and symbolic detail of military dress. Even in stylized form, the color (dark blue) and gold embellishments must remain to maintain the visual link to the original. Altering the coat’s base color or removing the gold trim would fundamentally change the identity.  
Question: Is the figure wearing a dark blue coat with multiple rows of gold buttons and gold trim along the edges?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The white ruffled cravat is a key accessory that distinguishes the formal 18th-century attire. It is positioned at the neck and extends down the chest. While it may be simplified in chibi form, its presence and white color are necessary to maintain authenticity. Removing it would reduce the historical accuracy of the costume.  
Question: Is there a white ruffled cravat visible at the neck and extending over the chest?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The powdered white wig with curled ends is a signature hairstyle of the era and directly contributes to the figure’s identity. Even in chibi form, the wig’s shape and color must be preserved. A different hairstyle would misrepresent the historical figure.  
Question: Does the figure have a powdered white wig with curled ends framing the face?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The gold coins, though now reimagined as spilling from a chest, must retain their **golden color and reflective surface** to maintain continuity with the original treasure motif. The original image features shiny, circular gold coins, and the instruction specifies "sparkling gold coins," implying preservation of their visual properties. The color and metallic texture are essential to the theme of wealth and treasure.  
Question: Are the coins depicted in golden color with a reflective, shiny surface?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The coat’s sleeve design includes gold stripes near the cuffs, which are part of the military insignia. These are minor but consistent details that reinforce the rank and style. While the instruction allows for chibi simplification, the presence of gold bands on the sleeves is a recurring element in the original and must be retained to preserve the visual coherence of the uniform.  
Question: Do the sleeves of the coat feature gold stripes near the cuffs?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The figure’s seated posture on a log is not required to be preserved, as the background is replaced. However, the **cross-legged position** is a specific detail that contributes to the relaxed demeanor. While it may be adjusted in chibi form, the general seated orientation and leg positioning are part of the original composition and help maintain visual consistency. Though not critical, it supports coherence.  
Question: Is the figure seated with legs crossed?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1
