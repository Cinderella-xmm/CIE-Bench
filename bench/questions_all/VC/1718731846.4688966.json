      "thinking_process": "The vertical split between black and white fur on the face is the most iconic feature of this figurine, defining its unique appearance. It is the primary identifier that distinguishes it from other dog representations. Even if rendered in wood tones, the **division line must remain exactly vertical and bisecting the face**, preserving the symmetry and duality. Losing this would fundamentally alter the subject’s identity.",
      "question": "Is the vertical facial split between black and white fur still present, dividing the face precisely down the center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The large, round eyes with glossy reflections are essential to the figurine’s expressive and cartoonish character. They are positioned symmetrically and dominate the facial area. Their **shape, size, and reflective quality** are core to recognition. Any distortion or simplification would diminish the emotional impact and visual identity.",
      "question": "Are both eyes large, round, and positioned symmetrically on either side of the facial split, with visible highlights reflecting light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The upright sitting posture with front paws placed forward is a key pose that defines the figurine’s stance and balance. It contributes to the sense of alertness and cuteness. Changing the posture (e.g., lying down or crouching) would disrupt the intended presentation and make it unrecognizable as the same subject.",
      "question": "Is the dog in an upright sitting position with both front paws flat on the ground and hind legs tucked beneath the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The ears are sharply pointed and erect, with a clear pink inner lining and dark outer edge. Their **shape and orientation** are distinctive. While the material may change to wood, the **ear structure must remain unchanged** to preserve the breed-like appearance and overall design.",
      "question": "Are both ears pointed upward, erect, and symmetrical, with visible pink inner surfaces and dark outer edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The white muzzle with a black nose and subtle whisker lines is a defining facial feature. The **nose is centrally located**, and the **whisker lines extend outward** from the snout. These details contribute to the realistic yet stylized look. Altering the nose shape or removing whiskers would degrade facial accuracy.",
      "question": "Is the black nose centered on the white muzzle, with visible whisker lines extending from the sides of the snout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The collar and tags are functional accessories that identify the figurine as a pet. Their **presence and position** around the neck are important for continuity. Even if made of wood, they must remain in place. Removing or relocating them would break the narrative logic of the object.",
      "question": "Is there a collar visible around the dog’s neck with at least one tag hanging from it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
