      "thinking_process": "The multi-tiered, stepped gable structure is the defining architectural feature of a stave church. Its absence or replacement with a single conical tower would fundamentally alter the identity of the structure. This tiered silhouette is a core recognition element across historical references, making it essential to retain even when transformed into a magical tower. Losing it would make the building unrecognizable as a stave church derivative. Therefore, this element carries a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Does the edited image preserve the multi-tiered, stepped gable structure of the church, with at least three distinct roof levels stacked vertically?",

      "thinking_process": "The carved wooden patterns along the eaves and gables are unique to stave churches and represent cultural craftsmanship. Even if luminescent runes are added, the underlying carved texture must remain visible or implied to maintain authenticity. Removing or replacing these carvings entirely would erase a critical identifying trait. Thus, this is a key visual detail with a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Are there visible carved wooden patterns along the eaves and gables of the church, even if overlaid with glowing runes?",

      "thinking_process": "The central spire topped with a cross-shaped finial is both a religious symbol and an architectural hallmark. Although the instruction allows for glowing orbs, the cross must remain present or structurally recognizable to preserve the building’s identity as a church. Without it, the structure could be misidentified as a tower or monument. This is a core functional and symbolic element, warranting a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the cross-shaped finial still present at the very top of the central spire, even if partially obscured by glowing celestial orbs?",

      "thinking_process": "The horn-like projections on the roof corners are iconic Norse decorative elements, often representing dragon heads or mythological beasts. These are not just aesthetic—they are culturally significant markers. Even if transformed into swirling cloud shapes, their position and angular form should be retained. Their removal would undermine the architectural style. This is a high-priority detail, assigned 2 points.",
      "question": "Are there horn-like or antler-shaped projections extending from the corners of the roof sections, especially at the top tiers?",

      "thinking_process": "The stone pathway leading to the main entrance provides spatial continuity and logical access. It grounds the structure in reality and connects it to the viewer. While the path may glow or appear enchanted, its existence and route must remain consistent. Its absence would break environmental logic. This is an important structural element, assigned 2 points.",
      "question": "Is there a stone-paved pathway leading directly from the foreground to the main entrance of the church?",

Changing its position or removing it would distort the architectural integrity. Even if the door glows or becomes translucent, its location and form must be preserved.

      "thinking_process": "The surrounding environment—specifically the snow-dusted evergreen trees and flowering shrubs—establishes the setting and season. While trees may become silver spirals, the presence of conifers and pink-purple flowers in the foreground must be retained in some form to preserve the original scene’s atmosphere. Their loss would disconnect the structure from its natural context. This is a secondary but important environmental cue, assigned 1 point.",

While the sky may gain magical glow, the mountain range and water body must remain in their relative positions to maintain scene coherence. Their removal or relocation would destroy the landscape’s realism. This is a key environmental feature, assigned 2 points.",
