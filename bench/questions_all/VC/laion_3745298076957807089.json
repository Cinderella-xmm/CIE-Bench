      "thinking_process": "The **rectangular glass bottle with rounded edges** is the core structural identity of the product. Its shape distinguishes it from other bottles and is central to the Cadenhead’s packaging design. If this shape is altered (e.g., made round or tapered), the object would no longer be recognizable as the original bottle. This is a key identification feature and must be preserved.",
      "question": "Is the bottle’s main body still a transparent rectangular glass container with softly rounded edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The **amber-colored liquid** inside the bottle is a defining characteristic of the whisky. Even though the liquid may be replaced with fragrance oil in the edited version, the **presence of a golden-yellow translucent liquid filling the bottle** is essential to maintaining the visual consistency of a full product. Removing or replacing it with a different color or opacity would misrepresent the original.",
      "question": "Is the interior of the bottle filled with a golden-yellow translucent liquid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The **black presentation box** with the arched window and gold lettering \"CADENHEAD'S\" and \"ESTD. 1842\" is a critical contextual element. It reinforces the brand identity and provides a frame for the product. While not part of the bottle itself, it is a key part of the original composition and helps establish the product’s premium status. Removing or altering it would disrupt the scene’s coherence.",
      "question": "Is the black box with the arched cutout and gold text \"CADENHEAD'S\" at the top and \"ESTD. 1842\" at the bottom still present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The **light reflections and highlights** on the glass surface are important for conveying the material quality and realism of the bottle. These details confirm the bottle is made of glass and help distinguish it from plastic or other materials. Losing these reflections would make the bottle appear flat or synthetic, undermining its authenticity.",
      "question": "Are there visible reflections and highlights on the glass surface of the bottle indicating transparency and smoothness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The **position of the bottle relative to the box**—specifically, the bottle placed to the left of the box with the box’s cutout aligned to display the bottle—is a compositional element that maintains visual balance and product presentation logic. Altering this spatial relationship would break the intended layout and reduce the image’s professional appearance.",
      "question": "Is the bottle positioned to the left of the box, with the box’s arched window aligned to frame the bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The **base of the bottle** shows slight thickness and a flat bottom, which is typical for stable glass bottles. This detail supports the perception of a real, physical object. If the base were flattened or distorted, it might suggest digital manipulation or loss of fidelity. While minor, it contributes to the overall realism.",
      "question": "Does the bottle have a flat, thickened base that rests stably on the surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
