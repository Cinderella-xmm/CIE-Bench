      "thinking_process": "The angular, multi-tiered headdress with symmetrical side flaps is the most iconic feature of the structure, combining Egyptian-style regality with mechanical design. Its specific geometric shape—especially the upward-pointing triangular top and wide lateral extensions—is essential for identifying the subject. If this form is altered or simplified, the structure loses its defining aesthetic and becomes unrecognizable. This is a core identity element, hence weighted at 3.",
      "question": "Is the angular, multi-tiered headdress with symmetrical side flaps present and unchanged in shape and position?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The glowing amber eyes are central to the emotional and technological identity of the figure. They indicate sentience and serve as a focal point. Their color and luminosity are unique identifiers; replacing them with neutral or different-colored lights would misrepresent the original character. Since the instruction allows \"neon animations,\" the eyes might be animated, but their fundamental color and location must remain consistent. This is a core recognition feature, thus weighted at 3.",
      "question": "Are the eyes glowing amber in color and positioned symmetrically within the face?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The stepped stone pedestal forms the foundation of the structure and defines its monumental scale. Its tiered, pyramidal shape is integral to the composition and echoes ancient architecture. Although the instruction allows refinement of surrounding buildings, it does not permit modification of the pedestal's basic form. Changing its shape or removing steps would distort the structure's balance and historical reference. This is a key architectural element, so it is weighted at 2.",
      "question": "Is the stepped stone pedestal base present with distinct horizontal layers forming a pyramidal shape?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The mechanical neck joints are visible beneath a translucent casing and show segmentation, suggesting articulation. These are functional design elements that reinforce the robotic nature of the figure. Removing or smoothing them would make the figure appear less mechanical and more like a statue. While the instruction allows surface changes, the underlying joint structure should remain visible to maintain logical consistency. This is an important detail supporting the identity, so it is weighted at 2.",
      "question": "Are the segmented mechanical joints visible along the neck, beneath a translucent casing?",

      "thinking_process": "The forward-facing orientation of the head is crucial for establishing direct engagement with the viewer. Any rotation or tilt would shift the narrative focus and break the intended symmetry. The instruction does not suggest changing the angle, so this posture must be preserved. It is a key compositional element affecting scene coherence, thus weighted at 2.",
      "question": "Is the head oriented directly forward, facing the viewer without rotation or tilt?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The facial symmetry—including the alignment of the nose, lips, and jawline—is essential for maintaining the human-like quality of the robot. Asymmetry would make the figure appear damaged or alien, altering its perceived identity. Even if the face becomes a digital display, the underlying facial structure must retain its balanced proportions. This is a minor but necessary detail for visual coherence, so it is weighted at 1.",
      "question": "Is the face symmetrically structured with aligned nose, lips, and jawline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The position of the head atop the pedestal is a spatial relationship that defines the monumentality of the structure. Moving the head to a different base or floating it would violate the original composition and logical support structure. The instruction does not allow such relocation, so this positional relationship must be preserved. It is a foundational scene element, thus weighted at 2.",
      "question": "Is the head positioned directly atop the stepped pedestal, supported by it without floating or being detached?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
