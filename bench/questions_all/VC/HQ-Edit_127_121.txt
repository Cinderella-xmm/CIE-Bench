**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

Description of reference image:  
The subject is a spider positioned centrally on a circular, geometrically precise web. The spider has eight legs with alternating black and orange bands, each leg ending in fine spines. Its body consists of two main parts: a cephalothorax (head-thorax) that is brown with a segmented appearance and a rounded abdomen covered in white, symmetrical markings resembling spots and lines arranged in a cross-like pattern. The spider's posture is static, facing forward, with its legs symmetrically spread across the web. The web is finely detailed, composed of radial threads and concentric circles, forming a classic orb-web structure. It is suspended between green leafy branches, which are arranged in a natural arc around the web. The leaves are oval-shaped, dark green with visible veins and slightly glossy surfaces, some bearing tiny water droplets. The background is a soft, overcast sky with a pale blue-gray gradient, creating a calm, natural outdoor atmosphere.

Thinking process:  
The editing instructions explicitly transform the spider into a mythical dream-weaver, indicating that the **form, anatomy, and physical attributes of the spider** are to be altered. Specific modifications include:
- Replacing the abdomen with a luminous orb
- Adding iridescent, stained-glass-like wings
- Adorning legs with golden filigree spirals
- Modifying fangs into crystal needles
- Adding an ethereal aura

These changes target **the entire morphology of the spider**, including its limbs, body segments, and appendages. However, the instruction does **not mention altering the web, the surrounding foliage, or the background**. Therefore, these elements are not specified for change and should be assumed to remain intact unless contradicted.

Additionally, while the spider’s identity is being mythologized, the **web’s structure and position**, the **branch arrangement**, and the **leaf shapes and textures** are not mentioned as subject to modification—implying they must be preserved for environmental consistency.

Allowed Changes List:  
(Spider’s abdomen → replaced with luminous orb)  
(Spider’s wings → added, iridescent, stained-glass mosaic)  
(Spider’s legs → adorned with golden filigree spirals)  
(Spider’s fangs → transformed into crystal needles)  
(Spider’s body → imbued with ethereal aura)  
(Spider’s overall form → reimagined as mythical dream-weaver)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements:  
While the spider is being transformed, certain **structural and environmental features** are critical to maintaining the scene’s integrity and visual coherence. The **orb-web structure** is iconic and functionally linked to the spider’s role—it is not merely decorative but central to the subject’s ecological context. Even if the spider becomes mythical, the web remains a key anchor to its original identity. The **arrangement of branches and leaves** forms a natural frame around the web, contributing to the composition and depth. These are not part of the transformation and must remain unchanged.

Functional/logical association elements:  
The spider is centered on the web, which is attached to the branches. This spatial relationship is essential—changing the web’s location or removing it would disrupt the logic of the scene. The **web’s radial symmetry and attachment points** must stay consistent to preserve realism and continuity. Similarly, the **branches’ positions and leaf distribution** maintain the environment’s stability; altering them would create dissonance.

Non-modified element deduction:  
After excluding all parts of the spider that are explicitly modified (abdomen, wings, legs, fangs, aura), the remaining **environmental components**—the web, branches, leaves, and background—are not mentioned for change. By exclusion and visual coherence principles, these must be preserved. Even though the spider is fantastical, the setting remains grounded in nature, so the **original plant details (leaf shape, vein patterns, water droplets)** and **web geometry** are vital for continuity.

Preservation Targets List:  
(The circular orb-web with radial and concentric threads)  
(The branching structure with oval-shaped green leaves)  
(The positioning of the web between the branches)  
(The presence and texture of leaf veins and surface gloss)  
(The pale blue-gray sky background)  
(The overall framing of the web by the foliage)

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

Q1:  
Thinking process: The orb-web is the defining structural feature of this spider species and the core functional element of the scene. Its radial symmetry and concentric circles are unique identifiers of an orb-weaver spider’s web. If this pattern is lost or distorted, the image loses its biological and ecological authenticity, even if the spider is mythologized. The web’s geometry is not mentioned for alteration, so it must be preserved. This is a 3-point element because it is both functionally critical and visually iconic.

Question: Is the circular orb-web with clearly defined radial and concentric threads still present and structurally intact?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The arrangement of branches forming an arch around the web creates a natural frame and establishes the spatial context. This layout is essential for depth and composition. Since no instruction specifies changing the branch structure, it must be retained. Altering the branch angles or positions would disrupt the balance and narrative of the scene. This is a 2-point element due to its importance in scene logic and framing.

Question: Are the branches positioned in a natural arc around the web, supporting it from multiple directions?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The oval-shaped leaves with visible veins and slight glossiness are distinctive botanical features that contribute to the realism of the environment. Their shape and texture help identify the plant species and provide visual detail. These are not mentioned for modification, so they must remain. Losing these details would make the foliage appear generic or inconsistent. This is a 2-point element due to its role in environmental specificity.

Question: Do the leaves retain their oval shape, visible venation, and glossy surface texture?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q4:  
Thinking process: Water droplets on the leaves add micro-detail and suggest recent moisture or dew, enhancing realism. While small, they are consistent across the original image and contribute to atmospheric coherence. Since the editing does not mention altering weather or surface conditions, these droplets should be preserved. Their absence would reduce visual fidelity. This is a 1-point element as it is a minor detail but contributes to overall consistency.

Question: Are there small, clear water droplets visible on the surfaces of some leaves?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The pale blue-gray sky background provides a neutral, natural backdrop that contrasts with the web and foliage. It supports the outdoor setting without distracting from the subject. Since the instruction does not specify changing the background, it must remain. Altering the sky tone or adding elements like clouds would shift the mood unnaturally. This is a 2-point element due to its role in setting the scene’s atmosphere.

Question: Is the background a soft, uniform pale blue-gray sky without additional elements such as clouds or sun?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The web’s attachment points to the branches are critical for structural logic. The threads connect precisely to the branch ends, ensuring the web appears anchored realistically. If these connection points are missing or misaligned, the web would seem floating or unstable. This is a 2-point element due to its functional and compositional importance.

Question: Are the web’s radial threads visibly connected to the branch ends at multiple points?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2
