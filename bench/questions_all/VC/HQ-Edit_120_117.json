      "thinking_process": "The red lantern room is a defining feature of the lighthouse, providing strong visual contrast and symbolic identity. It is located at the top of the tower and is distinct in both color and structure. If this element is lost or changed (e.g., turned yellow or removed), the lighthouse would no longer be identifiable as the original subject. Thus, its presence and color are critical for recognition.",
      "question": "Is the red lantern room with glass panes and domed roof present at the top of the lighthouse?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The cylindrical tower with its tapering form is the primary structural identifier of the lighthouse. Changing its shape to conical or rectangular would fundamentally alter its identity. The texture of the stone, including rust stains and weathering, contributes to its realism and uniqueness. Preserving this form ensures the object remains recognizable as the same lighthouse.",
      "question": "Does the lighthouse have a cylindrical tower with a tapering shape and weathered stone surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The gallery railing encircling the lantern room is a distinctive architectural detail that separates the lighthouse from similar structures. Its presence confirms the correct design and adds to the functional appearance of the tower. Removing it would make the structure look incomplete or incorrect.",
      "question": "Is there a metal railing encircling the lantern room near the top of the lighthouse?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The rectangular stone base with arched windows and a central wooden door is a key component of the lighthouse’s lower structure. This section provides functional and aesthetic grounding. Altering its shape or removing the door/windows would compromise the architectural integrity of the lighthouse.",
      "question": "Does the lighthouse have a rectangular stone base with arched windows and a central wooden door?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The lighthouse is positioned on rocky terrain, which is essential for its coastal identity. Even in the miniature globe, the lighthouse must rest on rock-like terrain to reflect its original setting. Removing this would break the environmental logic and reduce recognizability.",
      "question": "Is the lighthouse standing on rocky terrain within the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The waves surrounding the base of the lighthouse are crucial for conveying its maritime location. While the material may change (to resin), the presence of waves crashing around the rocks must be maintained to preserve the scene’s context. Without them, the lighthouse appears isolated and loses its coastal character.",
      "question": "Are there waves depicted around the base of the lighthouse, indicating its seaside location?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The window placement — particularly the vertical alignment of small rectangular windows and the larger arched window below — is a specific architectural detail. These are not arbitrary; their positions contribute to the lighthouse’s unique silhouette. Changing their location would distort the structure.",
      "question": "Are the windows on the tower arranged vertically with one small window above another, and an arched window on the base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "thinking_process": "The presence of a wooden door centered on the front of the base is a minor but identifiable feature. While not as critical as the lantern room, it contributes to the overall architectural accuracy. Its absence might suggest a different structure, slightly affecting coherence.",
      "question": "Is there a wooden door centered on the front face of the lighthouse base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
