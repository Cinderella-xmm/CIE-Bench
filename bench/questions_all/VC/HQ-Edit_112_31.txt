**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a realistic, full-grown horse standing in a sunlit meadow during golden hour. The horse has a rich chestnut coat with a prominent white blaze running down the center of its face, extending to the muzzle. Its mane is long, flowing, and light beige in color, cascading over its neck and partially obscuring its eyes. The horse’s body features a large white patch on its side, resembling a pinto pattern, and its legs are slender with white socks on the front legs. It stands alertly, facing slightly left, with a calm and gentle expression. The background consists of a soft-focus forest of coniferous trees under a warm, glowing sky, suggesting sunrise or sunset. The foreground is filled with numerous dandelion plants, each topped with a fluffy white seed head, growing densely across a vibrant green field. The lighting casts a golden glow on the horse’s mane and flanks, enhancing the texture of its fur and creating a dreamy, serene atmosphere.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction explicitly transforms the horse into a **chibi-style plush toy**, which implies a complete change in form: from a realistic animal to a stylized, cartoonish stuffed figure. This includes changes to proportions (large head, short legs), material (fabric instead of fur), and facial features (embroidered eyes, smile). The instruction also specifies replacing the natural environment with a **boxed diorama** featuring **felt dandelions** and a **forest backdrop**, indicating that the scene must be reimagined as an artificial display.

Therefore, the following elements are allowed to change:
- **Form and proportions** of the horse (e.g., head size, leg length)
- **Material and texture** of the horse (from real fur to fabric)
- **Facial features** (from realistic eyes and mouth to embroidered ones)
- **Color scheme** of the horse (soft brown fabric with white patches — still within the original color palette but now applied as textile)
- **Scene type**: transition from natural outdoor field to a **boxed diorama**
- **Dandelions**: changed from real plants to **felt versions**
- **Background**: replaced with a **forest backdrop** (but not necessarily the same tree arrangement)

However, the instruction does **not** specify changing the **core identity** of the subject (a horse), nor does it suggest altering the **essential visual characteristics** of the original horse such as its **color pattern**, **position in the field**, or **relationship to the dandelions**. While the form becomes plush, the **identity remains a horse**, and the **scene remains a field with dandelions and a forest behind** — just in a constructed format.

Thus, the allowed changes are:
- Transformation of the horse into a chibi plush
- Use of fabric textures and embroidery
- Modification of proportions (large head, stubby legs)
- Change of dandelions to felt versions
- Replacement of natural landscape with a boxed diorama setup

---

**Allowed Changes List:**
- Horse's form (realistic → chibi plush)
- Proportions (head size, leg length)
- Material (fur → soft fabric)
- Facial features (real eyes/mouth → embroidered eyes and smile)
- Dandelions (real plants → felt replicas)
- Scene environment (natural field → boxed diorama)
- Background (natural forest → painted or printed forest backdrop)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
Despite the transformation into a plush toy, certain **core recognition features** of the original horse must remain intact to preserve its identity and ensure consistency with the source image. These include:

- **Color pattern**: The chestnut base with white blaze and side patch is a defining feature of this specific horse. Even if rendered in fabric, the **presence and placement** of these colors must remain consistent.
- **Position and posture**: The horse is standing in a field, facing slightly left. This orientation should be preserved in the plush version to maintain spatial continuity.
- **Relationship to dandelions**: The horse is positioned among dandelions, with some visible in the foreground. The **spatial relationship** between the horse and the flowers should be retained — i.e., the horse is surrounded by them, not isolated.
- **Forest backdrop**: Though the background becomes a diorama, the **presence of a forest** behind the horse must remain to uphold the environmental context.
- **Sunlight direction and golden hour lighting**: The warm glow on the horse’s mane and body suggests a specific time of day. While lighting may be simulated in the diorama, the **direction and warmth** of the light should reflect the original.

Additionally, **functional/logical elements** must be preserved:
- The **horse is the central subject**, and the **dandelions are part of the immediate environment** — their relative positions should not be reversed or removed entirely.
- The **white blaze on the face** is a key identifier; removing or relocating it would alter the horse’s identity.

After excluding the allowed changes, the remaining **visual elements** that must be preserved are those that define the **subject’s identity**, **scene composition**, and **visual coherence**.

**Preservation Targets List:**
- Presence and position of the white blaze on the horse’s face
- Chestnut and white coloration pattern (especially the large white patch on the side)
- Horse standing in a field of dandelions
- Forest visible in the background
- Direction of sunlight (from the left, casting warm glow on the mane and flank)
- Horse facing slightly left
- Dandelions present in the foreground

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

Q1:  
Thinking process: The white blaze on the horse’s face is a core identification feature. It is a distinct, narrow strip of white running vertically from the forehead to the nose, clearly visible in the original image. This marking is essential for recognizing this particular horse. If absent or relocated, the identity of the subject is compromised. Therefore, this element must be preserved exactly as seen in the original.  
Question: Is there a white blaze running down the center of the horse's face from the forehead to the muzzle?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The large white patch on the horse’s side is a significant part of its unique coloration pattern. This irregular white area contrasts sharply with the chestnut coat and is a key visual identifier. Removing or altering its shape or position would make the horse unrecognizable from the original.  
Question: Does the horse have a large white patch on its left side, extending from the shoulder toward the flank?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The horse’s posture and orientation are critical for maintaining scene coherence. In the original, the horse faces slightly left, with its head turned in that direction. This positioning establishes the viewer’s perspective and interaction with the environment. Changing the direction would disrupt the spatial logic.  
Question: Is the horse facing slightly to the left of the frame?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The presence of dandelions in the foreground is a key environmental detail. They are not merely decorative; they establish the setting and scale. The original image shows numerous dandelion seed heads around the horse’s feet. Their absence would break the scene’s authenticity.  
Question: Are there multiple dandelion seed heads visible in the foreground, surrounding the horse’s legs?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The forest in the background provides depth and context. While the instruction allows for a diorama version, the **presence of a forest** behind the horse must be preserved. The silhouette of coniferous trees is visible in the original, and their inclusion maintains environmental continuity.  
Question: Is there a forest of tall coniferous trees visible in the background behind the horse?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The lighting direction is crucial for mood and realism. The original image shows warm sunlight coming from the left, illuminating the horse’s mane and left flank. This directional light creates highlights and shadows that define the form. Preserving this lighting ensures visual consistency even in a stylized version.  
Question: Is the sunlight coming from the left side of the image, casting a golden glow on the horse’s mane and left side?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The horse’s position relative to the dandelions is important. It is standing *among* them, not above or behind. This proximity indicates scale and immersion in the environment. Moving the horse away from the flowers would misrepresent the original composition.  
Question: Is the horse standing directly within the field of dandelions, with flower stalks reaching up to its legs?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q8:  
Thinking process: The horse’s ears are upright and pointed, a detail that contributes to its alert expression. While the plush version may simplify them, their **presence and orientation** should be maintained to preserve the character’s demeanor.  
Question: Are both ears of the horse upright and pointing forward?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1
