      "thinking_process": "The five-star base with five legs and one caster per leg is a core functional and iconic feature of rolling office chairs. It defines the chair’s mobility and stability. Even when transformed into LEGO, this structure must retain its five-point geometry and caster placement to maintain the chair’s identity. Loss of this would result in a non-functional or unrecognizable office chair, making it a critical identification element. Therefore, it receives a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the chair supported by a five-star base with exactly five legs, each ending in a caster?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The headrest is a defining feature of this particular office chair model, positioned distinctly above the main backrest. It serves both ergonomic and aesthetic purposes. Even if rebuilt in LEGO, its presence and elevated position must be preserved to maintain the chair’s identity. Removing or relocating it would fundamentally alter the chair’s design and make it unrecognizable. Thus, it is a key recognition element with a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Is there a separate headrest cushion positioned directly above the main backrest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The armrests are attached to the sides of the chair and extend outward, forming part of the ergonomic support system. The instruction specifies they should remain as “simple hinged parts,” indicating their lateral placement and connection point must be preserved. Their absence or relocation would disrupt the chair’s functional symmetry and visual balance. This is a key structural element affecting both form and function, thus assigned a weight of 2 points.",
      "question": "Are there two armrests, one on each side, extending horizontally from the chair’s midsection?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The vertical alignment of the backrest relative to the seat is essential for maintaining the chair’s ergonomic profile and visual proportion. This alignment ensures the backrest supports the user’s spine properly. Even in LEGO form, this spatial relationship must be preserved. Disrupting it would compromise the chair’s intended use and appearance. This is an important structural relationship, hence a weight of 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the backrest vertically aligned behind the seat, rising from the same central axis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The overall silhouette of the chair — including the tall backrest and headrest — is a distinctive visual identifier. While materials and textures may change, the general outline must remain consistent to preserve recognition. This includes the height ratio between seat and backrest. Altering this silhouette would make the chair unrecognizable as the original model. This is a secondary but important visual cue, thus assigned a weight of 1 point.",
      "question": "Does the chair maintain a tall, high-back silhouette with the headrest significantly higher than the seat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
