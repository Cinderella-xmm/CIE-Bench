      "thinking_process": "The McLaren logo is the primary brand identifier and a key element in distinguishing this car from other models. It is centrally located on the front hood and is a small but highly recognizable emblem. If removed or replaced, the car would no longer be identifiable as a McLaren, which undermines the core identity of the subject. This makes it a 3-point weight element.",
      "question": "Is the McLaren logo present on the front hood of the car?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The trapezoidal shape of the LED headlights is a defining design feature of the McLaren 570S. It is unique to this model and contributes to its aggressive styling. Altering this shape would make the car resemble a different variant or brand. Therefore, preserving this exact geometric form is essential for accurate representation.",
      "question": "Are the front headlights shaped as narrow, trapezoidal units with sharp edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The red brake calipers are a signature performance detail visible through the black wheels. They are not only functional but also serve as a visual cue to the car’s high-performance nature. Their presence and color are distinctive and help identify the vehicle's sporty character. Removing or changing their color would reduce authenticity.",
      "question": "Are red brake calipers visible behind the black multi-spoke wheels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The black side air intake vent with its angular cutout is a structural design element that enhances both aesthetics and airflow. It is a consistent feature across the 570S model and contributes to its aerodynamic profile. Its absence or modification would alter the car’s identity.",
      "question": "Is there a black angular side air intake vent running along the door line?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The metallic silver paint finish with visible reflections is a key visual attribute that defines the car’s premium appearance. It affects how light interacts with the surface and contributes to the sense of luxury and precision engineering. Any deviation in color or reflectivity would compromise the visual accuracy.",
      "question": "Is the car painted in a metallic silver finish with visible surface reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The dihedral door line, though closed, is a structural contour that runs from the front fender over the door to the rear, forming a sharp crease. This is a hallmark of McLaren design and helps distinguish it from other supercars. Preserving this line ensures the correct silhouette.",
      "question": "Does the car have a visible dihedral door line extending from the front fender to the rear?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The overall body proportions—long hood, short rear deck, and low ground clearance—are fundamental to the car’s identity as a mid-engine supercar. Distorting these would make it unrecognizable as a McLaren 570S. While not a single feature, the proportional relationship between sections must be maintained.",
      "question": "Is the car proportioned with a long front hood and short rear deck, characteristic of a mid-engine layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
