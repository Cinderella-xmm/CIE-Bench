      "thinking_process": "The upright blue crest is a key anatomical and visual identifier of the Blue Jay. Its presence and shape are essential for species recognition. If lost or altered in form (e.g., flattened or absent), the bird would no longer be identifiable as a Blue Jay. This feature is central to both real-world identification and artistic representation, making it a core identity element.",
      "question": "Is the bird’s crest upright and vividly blue, matching the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The white facial markings and black facial stripe are signature traits of the Blue Jay, distinguishing it from similar corvids. Their precise placement and contrast are crucial for accurate identification. Altering or omitting them would fundamentally change the bird’s identity, even in a sculptural form.",
      "question": "Are there distinct white markings around the eye and a black stripe running through the face, as seen in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The wing pattern — specifically the cloud-like white patches on a blue background — is a unique and highly recognizable trait of the Blue Jay. This pattern is not only diagnostic but also visually dominant in the image. Losing it would make the bird unrecognizable, even if color is preserved.",
      "question": "Do the wings display clear white patches resembling clouds against a blue background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The tail feathers have a distinctive barred pattern of alternating blue and black stripes ending in white tips. This pattern is a hallmark of the Blue Jay and contributes significantly to its silhouette and identity. Even in a miniature sculpture, this detail must be preserved to maintain authenticity.",
      "question": "Does the tail show vertical blue and black bars ending in white tips?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies placing the bird on a wooden perch. Though the environment changes, the functional relationship of the bird perched on wood must remain. The wooden surface supports the bird and maintains continuity with the original pose. Changing this would break the logical consistency of the subject’s position.",
      "question": "Is the bird positioned on a wooden surface, maintaining the perching posture from the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction explicitly requires using the bird’s \"vibrant blue and white palette.\" This means the dominant colors — especially the contrast between blue and white — must be preserved. While shading or material may change (e.g., due to sculpture texture), the core color scheme is essential for visual fidelity and identity.",
      "question": "Are the primary colors of the bird predominantly vibrant blue and white, matching the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
