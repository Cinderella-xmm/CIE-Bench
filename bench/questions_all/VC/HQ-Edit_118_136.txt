**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a young male skater mid-air, performing a trick in a skatepark. He wears a red hooded sweatshirt with the hood up, black jeans, white socks, and black-and-white Nike sneakers (specifically resembling the Air Force 1 model). His hair is light brown and windswept, indicating motion. The skateboard is wooden with visible yellow wheels and a blue-green deck underside. The skater’s posture is dynamic: crouched low, arms extended for balance, body angled forward, and one foot on the board while the other is slightly raised. The background features a concrete skatepark with graffiti-covered ramps and walls, including bold red, pink, and blue tags such as “Banks” and “7X.” A second person—an older man in a dark jacket—is running across the bottom of the ramp in the distance. Power lines and utility poles are visible in the sky, under a bright blue sky with scattered clouds. The lighting is natural daylight, casting soft shadows.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instructions specify transforming the skater into a futuristic cyberpunk athlete, replacing his clothing with metallic armor and neon accents, changing the skateboard into a hoverboard with a glowing transparent deck, and altering the skatepark into a neon-lit urban landscape with digital graffiti animations. The style should be vibrant and otherworldly with motion lines emphasizing movement.

From this, we can identify:

- **Subject transformation**: The skater's form is to be changed — hoodie, jeans, sneakers, and skateboard are explicitly replaced.
- **Scene transformation**: The skatepark environment is to be transformed into a neon-lit urban setting; thus, the physical structure of the skatepark (ramps, walls) may be altered or stylized, but not necessarily preserved in original form.
- **Dynamic motion**: The action of mid-air skateboarding is preserved in concept, though the means (hoverboard vs. skateboard) changes.
- **Background elements**: Graffiti, power lines, and distant figures are not mentioned as required to be retained — they are part of the scene being transformed.

Thus, only those elements **not explicitly mentioned for replacement or transformation** must be considered for retention.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
(Specific element 1 that allows for changes): The red hoodie and its design  
(Specific element 2 that allows for changes): Black jeans  
(Specific element 3 that allows for changes): Black-and-white Nike sneakers  
(Specific element 4 that allows for changes): Wooden skateboard with yellow wheels  
(Specific element 5 that allows for changes): Concrete skatepark ramps and graffiti walls  
(Specific element 6 that allows for changes): Background scenery including power lines, utility poles, and distant figure  
(Specific element 7 that allows for changes): Sky and cloud composition  
(Specific element 8 that allows for changes): Overall lighting and atmosphere

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
We now apply exclusion logic based on the allowed changes list above.

**Core recognition elements:**  
While the subject is being transformed, the **original identity** of the character is not tied to any iconic artwork or well-known symbol. However, certain **visual features** define the subject’s presence and action in the original image. These include:
- The **dynamic mid-air pose** — crouched, arms outstretched, body angled forward — which conveys the action of skateboarding.
- The **position and orientation of the skateboard relative to the feet**, showing control during a trick.
- The **presence of the second figure (older man)** in the background — though not central, it provides spatial context and scale.
- The **motion direction** implied by the skater’s gaze and body lean — toward the right side of the frame.

These are not being directly replaced but are foundational to the scene’s narrative and logic.

**Functional/logical association elements:**  
- The **skater’s foot placement on the board** is essential for the trick’s plausibility. Even if the board becomes a hoverboard, the foot positioning should remain consistent with a real skateboarding motion.
- The **relative position between the skater and the ground/ramp** must preserve the illusion of height and trajectory — i.e., the skater is clearly airborne above the ramp surface.
- The **second figure’s location and posture** (running across the ramp) provide depth and environmental logic; removing or misplacing him would break scene coherence.

**Non-modified element deduction:**  
Although the clothing and board are to be replaced, **the skater’s body shape, facial features, hair color and style, and overall silhouette** are not specified for change. Since these are not mentioned in the instruction as being altered, they should be retained unless logically incompatible with the new cyberpunk design.

However, since the instruction says "transform the skater into a futuristic cyberpunk athlete," this implies a full redesign of appearance, including face and hair — so **only non-essential details** like **hair texture, eye color, facial expression**, etc., may be retained **if not conflicting**.

But critical **functional aspects** — such as **body posture**, **limb positioning**, and **spatial relationship to the board** — must remain consistent to preserve the **action integrity**.

Additionally, the **background’s structural layout** — e.g., the ramp forming a U-shape, the flat platform below — might be retained in form even if stylized, because the **motion trajectory** depends on it.

Therefore, the **core preserved elements** are:

1. The **mid-air crouched posture** of the skater
2. The **foot-on-board configuration** (one foot on the board, other slightly raised)
3. The **directional lean and gaze** toward the right
4. The **relative spatial position** of the skater above the ramp
5. The **presence and approximate position of the second figure** in the background
6. The **overall motion trajectory** implied by body angle and board tilt

Even though the environment is to be transformed, the **logical layout of the skatepark** (e.g., curved ramp, flat area) may need to be preserved in abstract form to maintain continuity.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
(Element 1 that should be maintained): The skater’s mid-air crouched posture with arms extended  
(Element 2 that should be maintained): The foot placement on the skateboard (one foot on deck, other lifted)  
(Element 3 that should be maintained): The skater’s directional lean and gaze toward the right side of the frame  
(Element 4 that should be maintained): The spatial relationship of the skater being above the ramp surface  
(Element 5 that should be maintained): The presence of the second figure running across the ramp in the background  
(Element 6 that should be maintained): The curved ramp structure forming a bowl-like shape in the foreground

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The mid-air crouched posture with arms extended is the core action identifier of the skater. This pose defines the moment of the trick and is essential for recognizing the athletic movement. If lost, the image no longer represents a skateboarding maneuver, regardless of futuristic styling. It is a functional and visual anchor of the scene, making it a 3-point element.
    Question: Is the skater depicted in a mid-air crouched posture with both arms extended outward for balance?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The foot placement — one on the board, one slightly lifted — is critical to the realism and mechanics of the skateboarding trick. Even if the board becomes a hoverboard, the foot positioning must remain consistent to preserve the illusion of motion. This is a functional element tied to the action, hence weight 3.
    Question: Is the skater’s left foot placed firmly on the skateboard while the right foot is slightly raised off the board?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The skater’s head and gaze direction toward the right side of the image indicate motion trajectory and focus. This aligns with the physics of the jump and maintains narrative consistency. Changing this would disrupt the sense of movement, making it a key directional cue worth 2 points.
    Question: Does the skater’s head and eyes look toward the right side of the frame, indicating forward momentum?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The spatial relationship between the skater and the ramp — specifically, the skater being clearly above the ramp surface — is essential for conveying the jump. If the skater appears grounded or below the ramp, the action fails. This is a logical spatial element critical to the scene’s coherence, hence 2 points.
    Question: Is the skater positioned above the surface of the ramp, indicating he is airborne?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The presence of the second figure (older man) running across the ramp provides depth, scale, and environmental context. While not central, its absence would remove a key detail from the original scene. Though the instruction doesn’t require retaining it, since it’s not listed for modification, it should be preserved to maintain visual fidelity. This is a secondary but identifiable detail, worth 1 point.
    Question: Is there a second person, an older man in a dark jacket, visible in the background running across the ramp?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The curved ramp structure forms the bowl-like shape of the skatepark, defining the environment’s geometry. Even if stylized into a cyberpunk cityscape, the basic curved form should be retained to preserve the spatial logic of the jump. This is a key architectural feature of the original scene, worth 2 points.
    Question: Is there a curved ramp structure forming a bowl-like shape in the foreground, beneath the skater?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
