Description of reference image: The subject is a close-up portrait of Albert Einstein, an elderly man with wild, untamed white hair that appears voluminous and slightly disheveled, framing his face. His facial features include deep-set eyes with visible wrinkles around them, a prominent nose, and a distinctive mustache that is neatly trimmed and gray-white in color. He wears a dark sweater over a collared shirt, with the collar visible at the neckline. The sweater has a ribbed texture and a crew neck design. The background is dark and indistinct, likely an indoor setting with soft lighting focused on the subject’s face. The photograph is in black and white, emphasizing contrasts in tone and texture.

Thinking process: First, analyze the instructions that clearly state what can be changed: "Transform the individual into a plush doll" — this indicates a complete transformation of form, including material (plush), texture (soft, tactile), and proportions (exaggerated head, rotund body). "Wild, fluffy white hair" — the hairstyle can be altered in texture but retains its general appearance as white and unruly. "Cloth the doll in a cute, miniaturized version of a sweater" — the clothing type (sweater) is preserved, but its scale and style are modified. "Black stitches for details" — introduces new visual elements not present in the original. "Maintain the distinct vertical black stripes of the sweater design in soft stitched patterns" — this specifies that the stripe pattern must be retained, even if stylized as stitched lines. Thus, allowed changes include:
- Subject's physical form (human → plush doll)
- Hair texture (from natural to fluffy/plush)
- Body proportions (exaggerated head, rotund body)
- Clothing style (miniaturized, with added stitching detail)
- Material of clothing (fabric → plush-like cloth)
- Background (not mentioned, so assumed changeable)

Allowed Changes List:
- Subject’s form (human → plush doll)
- Hair texture and volume (natural → fluffy, soft)
- Body proportions (head size, torso shape)
- Sweater style (miniaturized, stylized)
- Stitching details (added black stitches)
- Background environment
- Lighting and overall atmosphere

Step 2 – Determine the elements that should remain unchanged

Thinking process:
Core recognition elements: The identity of the subject is Albert Einstein, whose most iconic features are his wild white hair, distinctive mustache, and facial structure. Even when transformed into a plush doll, these features must be recognizable to preserve identity. Specifically:
- The presence of white hair (especially its wild, unkempt nature) is central to Einstein’s public image.
- The mustache is a defining facial feature; its shape and position must be preserved.
- The general facial structure—eyes, nose, forehead lines—must retain enough likeness to be identifiable.

Functional/logical association elements: The sweater worn by Einstein is part of his known appearance in this photo. While the instruction allows modification of its form (e.g., miniaturization), it explicitly requires retaining “the distinct vertical black stripes” in the sweater design. This means the stripe pattern must be preserved, even if rendered as stitched lines in the plush version. The sweater’s function as outerwear and its placement on the figure must also remain logically consistent (i.e., covering the upper body).

Non-modified element deduction: After excluding allowed changes (form, texture, proportion, material), the remaining elements that must be preserved are:
- The presence and shape of the mustache
- The general facial features (eye shape, nose, forehead wrinkles)
- The color and pattern of the sweater (specifically the vertical black stripes)
- The fact that the sweater is worn over a collared shirt (implied by visible collar in original)
- The relative positioning of the collar beneath the sweater

Preservation Targets List:
- The presence and shape of the mustache
- The wild, voluminous white hair
- The vertical black stripes on the sweater
- The visible collar underneath the sweater
- The facial structure including eye placement, nose, and forehead lines

Q1:  
Thinking process: The mustache is one of the most iconic and immediately recognizable features of Albert Einstein. Its shape—curved, thick, and positioned just below the nose—is essential for identifying him. In any stylized or transformed representation, especially a plush doll, losing this feature would make the character unrecognizable. Therefore, preserving the mustache’s presence and basic shape is critical for core identity retention. This element directly corresponds to a key visual identifier in the original image.
Question: Is the mustache present and shaped in a way that matches the original image, with a curved, thick form extending from both sides of the upper lip?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The wild, voluminous white hair is another hallmark of Einstein’s appearance. It is not merely hair but a specific configuration—untamed, flowing, and unevenly distributed across the head—that contributes significantly to his public identity. Even in a plush version, the hair must maintain this chaotic, full-bodied quality to be identifiable. The texture may change, but the silhouette and distribution must remain faithful.
Question: Does the hair retain its wild, voluminous, and unevenly distributed white appearance, particularly with strands extending outward from the sides and top of the head?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The vertical black stripes on the sweater are explicitly required to be maintained in the edited version, even if rendered as stitched patterns. These stripes are not random—they form a distinct visual pattern that is part of the original garment’s design. Their absence or alteration would violate the instruction and disrupt visual consistency. They serve as a functional detail that anchors the clothing to the original image.
Question: Are there vertical black stripes running down the front of the sweater, matching the pattern seen in the original image?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The collar of the shirt is visible beneath the sweater in the original image. Although the instruction allows for miniaturization and stylization, the logical relationship between the sweater and the shirt remains important. The collar must still be present and positioned under the sweater’s neckline to maintain fidelity to the original layering. Its absence would suggest a different outfit or misrepresentation.
Question: Is a portion of a light-colored shirt collar visible beneath the sweater’s neckline, aligned with the original image?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The facial structure—specifically the placement of the eyes, nose, and forehead lines—is crucial for maintaining likeness. While proportions may be exaggerated in the plush version, the relative positions of these features must remain consistent to preserve recognition. For example, the eyes should still be set wide apart, the nose prominent, and the forehead lined with wrinkles. Altering their spatial relationships would distort the identity.
Question: Do the eyes, nose, and forehead lines maintain their original relative positions and shapes, such as the horizontal creases on the forehead and the oval shape of the eyes?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The sweater’s ribbed texture is visible in the original image, particularly around the neckline and shoulders. While the instruction allows for stylization as stitched patterns, the fundamental texture and shape of the sweater must remain recognizable. A smooth or entirely flat surface would deviate too far from the original. The ribbing provides structural detail that supports identification.
Question: Is the sweater’s neckline and shoulder area textured with ribbed patterns consistent with the original image?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
