      "thinking_process": "The broad, flat snout with a wide, rounded muzzle is the most defining facial feature of a capybara. This morphology distinguishes it from other animals like bears or pigs. If this feature is altered (e.g., elongated, narrowed, or replaced with a human-like face), the subject would no longer be recognizable as a capybara. Thus, preserving the snout shape is a core identity requirement and carries the highest weight.",
      "question": "Is the capybara’s snout broad and flat with a rounded muzzle, consistent with its real-world anatomy?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The capybara’s ears are small, rounded, and positioned high on the head. These are key morphological markers. Changing their shape or position (e.g., making them pointed or earless) would compromise species recognition. Since they are not mentioned in the editing instruction as being replaced, they must remain in their original form.",
      "question": "Are the capybara’s ears small, rounded, and located high on the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The upright, frontal stance is crucial for maintaining the visual logic of the scene. Even if the capybara is now dressed as a gentleman, it must still stand in the same orientation to preserve continuity with the original composition. Altering the posture (e.g., side profile, crouching) would disrupt the intended framing and coherence.",
      "question": "Is the capybara standing upright and facing directly toward the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The hand posture—gripping an object in front of the chest—is functionally tied to the original action of holding a drink. Although the object changes, the gesture must remain to maintain logical consistency. The hands must still be positioned forward, with fingers curved around a vessel. Removing or altering this pose would break the continuity of the subject’s interaction with an object.",
      "question": "Are both hands positioned in front of the chest, gripping an object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The fur coloration—light brown with darker shading around the muzzle—is a key identifier. While the texture may be stylized, the base color and contrast must remain to preserve the capybara’s realistic appearance. Changing the fur to black, white, or patterned would misrepresent the species.",
      "question": "Is the capybara’s fur primarily light brown with darker tones around the muzzle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The body shape—stocky, large, with short legs and thick torso—is a distinguishing trait of capybaras. Even in Victorian attire, the underlying form must reflect this robust build. Altering it to appear slender or humanoid would violate biological accuracy and reduce recognition.",
      "question": "Does the capybara have a stocky, large body with short legs and a thick torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The presence of four limbs is fundamental to mammalian anatomy and must be preserved. While the legs may be obscured by clothing, their number and general placement must remain consistent. Losing one limb or adding extra limbs would distort the subject’s identity.",
      "question": "Does the capybara have four limbs visible or implied by posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
