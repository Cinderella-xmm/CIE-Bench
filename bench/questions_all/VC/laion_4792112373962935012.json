      "thinking_process": "The pale yellow color of the cocktail is a core identifier of a traditional margarita. This hue distinguishes it from other cocktails like mojitos (clear/green) or palomas (pink). If lost, the drink would no longer be visually identifiable as a margarita, undermining the foundation of the whimsical transformation. Therefore, this is a critical retention point with a weight of 3.",
      "question": "Is the cocktail liquid pale yellow in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The lime wedge is not only a garnish but a key ingredient and symbol of the margarita. Its green outer rind and segmented inner pulp are distinctive visual markers. Even if reimagined as a \"smiling cap,\" the underlying green color and structural segmentation must be preserved to maintain authenticity. Losing these would make the lime unrecognizable, breaking the connection to the original image.",
      "question": "Does the lime wedge have a bright green outer rind and visible segmented interior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The salt and spice rim is a signature feature of a spicy margarita. Its speckled texture, combining white salt with red chili flakes, is both visually unique and functionally significant. This detail defines the flavor profile and sets it apart from standard margaritas. Altering or removing this texture would misrepresent the drinkâ€™s identity, making it a high-priority retention element.",
      "question": "Is the rim of the glass coated with a speckled mixture of white and red granules?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The ice cubes are functional components of the drink, indicating chill and dilution over time. Their translucent, angular shapes are typical of standard ice and contribute to the realism of the beverage. Even if reimagined as \"eyes,\" their basic form and transparency must be preserved to maintain believability. Removing them would suggest a warm or non-alcoholic drink, which contradicts the original context.",
      "question": "Are there multiple translucent, angular ice cubes visible inside the glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The dark blue surface provides contrast and grounds the composition, helping highlight the vibrant colors of the drink and lime. While the background may be altered in the final poster, the original surface color and texture serve as a baseline for visual coherence. Retaining this helps ensure continuity between the original and edited versions, especially if the whimsical elements are superimposed.",
      "question": "Is the glass placed on a dark blue surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
