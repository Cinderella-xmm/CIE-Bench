Description of reference image: The subject is a young woman with long, wavy black hair and bangs, positioned slightly to the right side of the frame, facing leftward in profile. She is blowing bubbles using a pink bubble wand held in her right hand, while her left hand holds a yellow bottle of bubble solution. Her lips are parted mid-blow, and her cheeks are softly flushed. She wears a pale peach-colored off-the-shoulder dress with ruffled, fluffy sleeves and a pleated skirt that flows down to mid-calf. The dress has soft texture and delicate folds, catching warm sunlight. Surrounding her are multiple iridescent soap bubbles floating at various heights and distances, reflecting rainbow hues. The background features a sunlit garden path lined with green foliage and pink flowering bushes, bathed in golden morning light with a bright sun flare in the upper-left corner. The overall atmosphere is serene and dreamlike, with natural lighting casting soft shadows.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions word by word. The instruction states: "Create an art postcard depicting the girl as a fairy-tale character, with her dress transformed into flowing petals and bubbles as glowing lanterns. Enhance her hair with silver strands, add a whimsical path with stars, and include a moonlit writing space framed by dreamy cloud motifs."  
From this, we extract the following allowed changes:
- Dress form → transformed into flowing petals (so original dress shape and material can be changed)
- Bubbles → transformed into glowing lanterns (so bubble appearance and function can change)
- Hair → enhanced with silver strands (so hair color and texture can be altered)
- Path → replaced with whimsical star-lit path (so ground surface and environment can change)
- Background → includes moonlit writing space with clouds (so sky and spatial layout can change)

However, no instruction explicitly says to alter or remove the subject’s identity, posture, facial features, or core action (blowing bubbles). The transformation of bubbles into lanterns does not imply removal of the bubble-blowing action; it implies reimagining the bubbles’ visual nature. Similarly, the dress being transformed into petals does not negate the need for the garment to remain associated with the character’s body structure and position.

Therefore, the allowed changes list includes:
- Dress design and texture (transformed into petals)
- Bubble appearance (changed to glowing lanterns)
- Hair color and texture (addition of silver strands)
- Ground path (replaced with starry whimsical path)
- Sky and ambient elements (added moonlit space and clouds)
- Overall lighting and mood (shift from daylight to moonlit fantasy)

Allowed Changes List:
- The dress's form and fabric texture
- The bubbles' visual properties (from transparent iridescent spheres to glowing lanterns)
- The hair's color and strand composition (addition of silver highlights)
- The path beneath the subject (replaced with starry whimsical path)
- The sky and atmospheric lighting (transition to moonlit scene)
- The background flora and spatial depth (to accommodate new fantasy elements)

Thinking process:
Core recognition elements: The subject’s identity as a young woman blowing bubbles must remain recognizable despite fantasy transformation. Key identifiers include her face, especially the expression (lips parted, cheeks flushed), hairstyle (long wavy black hair with bangs), and the act of blowing bubbles. Even if the bubbles become lanterns, the gesture and positioning must remain consistent. The dress may change, but its placement on the body and silhouette should still align with the original figure—especially the off-the-shoulder cut and sleeve style. These are essential for maintaining continuity of character identity.

Functional/logical association elements: The act of holding the bubble wand and solution bottle is functional—it explains the origin of the bubbles. Even if bubbles become lanterns, the hands must still hold the same objects in similar positions. Otherwise, the logic of “creating” the glowing lanterns breaks. The spatial relationship between the girl and the floating objects must remain coherent: bubbles/lanterns should emerge from the wand, not appear randomly.

Non-modified element deduction: Elements not mentioned in the allowed change list must be retained unless logically implied to be changed. For example, the girl’s facial structure, eye shape, nose, and skin tone are not mentioned as changeable—thus they must remain. The pose (side profile, head tilted slightly upward) is central to the scene and not stated as altered—so it must stay. The general orientation of the body (standing upright, arms raised) must also be preserved for consistency.

Preservation Targets List:
- Facial features including eyes, nose, lips, and blush on cheeks
- Long wavy black hair with bangs (excluding added silver strands)
- Position and gesture of hands holding bubble wand and bottle
- Off-the-shoulder silhouette of the dress (even if transformed into petals)
- Profile view of the subject facing left
- Act of blowing bubbles (motion and direction of breath)
- Presence of the pink bubble wand and yellow bottle

Q1:  
Thinking process: The key identification feature of the subject is her facial expression—specifically, the open mouth with visible red lips and flushed cheeks, which captures the moment of blowing bubbles. This is critical for recognizing the action and emotional state. If this expression is altered (e.g., closed mouth, neutral face), the narrative of bubble-blowing is lost. It is a core identity feature tied directly to the scene’s intent. Therefore, it must be preserved.  
Question: Is the girl’s mouth visibly open with red lips and rosy cheeks, indicating she is blowing bubbles?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The presence of the pink bubble wand in her right hand is a functional object directly tied to the action. Its shape and position are essential for understanding how the bubbles (or lanterns) originate. Even if transformed into a magical item, the wand must remain in the same hand and orientation. Removing or altering its position would break the logical cause-effect relationship.  
Question: Is the pink bubble wand held in the girl’s right hand, with its loop facing outward?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The yellow bottle of bubble solution is a key accessory that supports the functionality of the scene. It is held in the left hand and provides context for the source of the bubbles. Its color and cylindrical shape are distinctive and must remain identifiable even if stylized. Losing it would make the action unexplained.  
Question: Is a yellow cylindrical bottle held in the girl’s left hand?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The long, wavy black hair with bangs is a defining physical trait of the subject. While silver strands may be added, the base hair color and structure must remain unchanged. Altering the length, wave pattern, or bangs would fundamentally change the character’s appearance and identity.  
Question: Does the girl have long, wavy black hair with bangs covering her forehead?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The off-the-shoulder silhouette of the dress is a structural detail that defines the outfit’s style. Even if transformed into flowing petals, the dress must maintain the same shoulder exposure and sleeve width. Changing this would misrepresent the original attire’s form.  
Question: Is the dress designed with off-the-shoulder straps and puffy ruffled sleeves?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The profile view with the head slightly turned upward is crucial for capturing the direction of the bubble-blowing action. A frontal or full-side view would disrupt the dynamic of the scene. This posture is a core compositional element that must be preserved.  
Question: Is the girl shown in a side profile with her head tilted slightly upward?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The act of blowing bubbles is the central activity. Even if bubbles become lanterns, the motion of the breath and the direction of the bubbles must originate from her mouth. This action is the narrative anchor and must remain visually consistent.  
Question: Are bubbles (or lanterns) emerging from the girl’s mouth in the direction of the wand?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3
