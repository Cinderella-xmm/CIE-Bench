      "thinking_process": "The twin-engine configuration is a defining feature of this specific type of commercial aircraft (likely an Airbus A320 family). The engines are mounted under the wings and have a distinct circular intake with visible fan blades and nacelle shape. This is a core identification element because changing the number or placement of engines would make the aircraft unrecognizable as the same model. Since the instruction mentions incorporating airplane elements like wings and propellers into the box design, the engine placement must be preserved in symbolic form. Losing this feature would break the reference to the original aircraft.",
      "question": "Are the two jet engines mounted under the wings of the airplane present and correctly positioned?",

      "thinking_process": "The row of oval passenger windows is a signature visual trait of commercial airliners and helps identify the aircraft type. Their consistent spacing and shape along the fuselage are crucial for recognition. The instruction does not mention removing or altering these windows, and since the airplane is being used as a design motif in the collectible box, the window pattern must be retained to maintain authenticity. Removing or distorting them would compromise the airplane’s identity.",
      "question": "Is the continuous row of oval-shaped passenger windows visible along the side of the fuselage?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The nose cone and cockpit windows form a distinctive front profile of the aircraft. The rounded nose and three-part windshield (with two side windows and one central panel) are key identifiers. The instruction requires the airplane to be represented in the collectible design, so this frontal feature must be preserved to ensure the aircraft remains recognizable. Altering this would misrepresent the original aircraft.",
      "question": "Is the rounded nose cone with the three-part cockpit window configuration present at the front of the airplane?",
      "choices": [

      "thinking_process": "The vertical stabilizer (tail fin) is a critical structural element that defines the rear of the aircraft. Its height and shape are unique to this aircraft model. The instruction specifies incorporating airplane elements into the box design, which implies the tail must be included. Removing or altering it would disrupt the aircraft’s silhouette and make it unidentifiable.",
      "question": "Is the tall vertical stabilizer (tail fin) present at the rear of the airplane?",

      "thinking_process": "The landing gear with multiple wheels is a functional and visual detail that confirms the aircraft is on the ground. The configuration — with dual wheels under the fuselage and wing-mounted gear — is characteristic of this aircraft type. While the instruction allows for scene transformation, the presence of landing gear supports the realism of the original image and must be preserved in the hyper-realistic depiction of the figure on the wing. Omitting it would break the logical connection to the real-world setting.",
      "question": "Are the landing gear assemblies with multiple wheels visible beneath the fuselage and wings?",

      "thinking_process": "The wing structure, especially the main wing span and engine mounting points, is essential for the character’s positioning in both the collectible and realistic depictions. The instruction specifies placing the character on a wing, so the wing must retain its basic form and function. The wing’s shape and attachment to the fuselage are key to maintaining spatial logic. Altering this would undermine the narrative of the character standing on the airplane.",

      "thinking_process": "The cockpit windows are part of the front-facing profile and contribute to the aircraft’s identity. Their specific arrangement — two side windows and one central panel — is a minor but identifiable detail. While not as critical as the engines or fuselage, they help confirm the aircraft model and must be preserved for visual coherence.",
      "question": "Are the three cockpit windows arranged in a horizontal line at the front of the airplane?",
