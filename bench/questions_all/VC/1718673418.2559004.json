      "thinking_process": "The rocky base of the island is a core structural feature that defines the island’s form and elevation. Its shape and position are critical to the scene’s identity. If this rock formation is completely removed or reshaped beyond recognition, the island would lose its defining geographic character. Although the instruction allows transforming mountains into roots, the **island’s own base** is not described as such, so it must retain its original silhouette and placement. This is a 3-point element because it is the foundation of the entire composition.",
      "question": "Is the elevated rocky outcrop forming the base of the island still present with its original silhouette and position?",

      "thinking_process": "The clustered arrangement of houses is a key identifier of the village. The dense, tiered layout ascending the slope is unique and visually distinctive. Changing this to scattered or isolated structures would break the original village’s identity. Even if roofs become mushroom-shaped, the **grouping and density** must remain. This is a 3-point element because it defines the settlement’s character.",

Even if stylized, its **path and connection** to the dock must remain. Removing or rerouting it would disrupt scene logic. This is a 2-point element because it supports spatial coherence.",

      "thinking_process": "The dock at the water’s edge is a functional anchor point. It establishes the interface between land and water. Even if boats become airships, the **structure of the dock** must remain to preserve the scene’s logic. Its absence would make the transformation illogical. This is a 2-point element due to its functional importance.",
