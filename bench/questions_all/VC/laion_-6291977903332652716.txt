**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a picturesque canal scene in Strasbourg, France, featuring traditional Alsatian half-timbered houses lining both sides of a calm, reflective waterway. The buildings are characterized by exposed dark wooden beams forming geometric patterns against light-colored plaster walls, with steeply pitched slate roofs and dormer windows. On the left, a prominent two-story house has a reddish-brown timber frame and pink stone foundation, while on the right, a larger structure features white plaster with dark brown framing, overhanging upper floors, and flower boxes along the balconies. The canal reflects the sky and buildings with mirror-like clarity under a bright blue sky. A small pedestrian bridge spans the canal in the mid-ground, connecting the two sides. People are visible walking along the paved paths beside the canal, and greenery including trees and shrubs enhances the charm of the setting. The overall atmosphere is serene and historically authentic.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction states: *"Transform the picturesque canal scene into a miniature diorama within a clear sphere."* This indicates that the **entire scene’s physical form** will be altered — it will no longer exist as an open outdoor landscape but instead be enclosed within a transparent spherical container. However, this transformation does not imply that all elements must be changed or removed; rather, it specifies how the scene should be presented (as a diorama). The instruction further says to *"enhance the Alsatian timber-framed houses with finely detailed textures and muted autumnal colors"*, which means the **architectural style** remains central, though color and texture may be adjusted. It also mentions *"encapsulate the canal with glossy resin for a reflective water surface"* — so the water's reflectivity is preserved, but its material becomes synthetic resin. *"Integrate mini bridges and greenery for authenticity"* implies the bridge and vegetation remain, but scaled down. *"Add compact, hand-sculpted characters in vibrant clothes on the walkways"* suggests new figures are introduced, but they must align with the existing spatial layout.

From this analysis:
- The **form of the scene** changes (from open space to enclosed sphere).
- The **color palette** of the houses can shift toward muted autumnal tones.
- The **material of the water** becomes glossy resin, but its **reflective quality** is maintained.
- The **bridge and greenery** are retained, possibly resized.
- New **miniature human figures** are added, but their placement must respect the original walkway positions.
- The **half-timbered architectural style** is core and must be preserved despite textural enhancement.

Thus, the allowed changes include:
- Transformation of the entire scene into a spherical diorama.
- Adjustment of house colors to muted autumnal hues.
- Replacement of natural water with glossy resin while preserving reflection.
- Scaling down of structures and addition of new figurines.
- Enhancement of textures on buildings.

**Allowed Changes List:**
- The overall scene composition being enclosed in a clear sphere
- Color adjustment of buildings to muted autumnal tones
- Water surface replaced with glossy resin but retaining reflective properties
- Introduction of hand-sculpted miniature characters in vibrant clothing
- Slight scaling or stylization of bridges and greenery to fit diorama format
- Enhanced textures on timber frames

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
To determine what must be retained, we apply exclusion based on the allowed changes above.

**Core recognition elements:**  
The **Alsatian half-timbered architecture** is iconic and defines the identity of the location. Key features include:
- Exposed dark wooden beams arranged in crisscross or diamond patterns
- Light-colored plaster infill between beams
- Steep gabled roofs with dormers
- Overhanging upper stories (especially on the right-hand building)
These are essential for identifying the scene as Strasbourg-style architecture. Even if colors are muted, the **structural pattern** of beams and panels must remain intact.

**Functional/logical association elements:**  
- The **canal** must remain as a central linear feature, separating the two rows of buildings.
- The **pedestrian bridge** connects the two banks and is a functional element; its position relative to the buildings must be preserved even if scaled.
- The **walkways** along the canal edges must retain their alignment with the buildings to maintain spatial logic.
- The **reflection in the water** is critical to the visual harmony and realism; although the water becomes resin, its **mirror-like reflection** of the buildings must persist.

**Non-modified element deduction:**  
Despite texture enhancements and color shifts, certain visual details must remain:
- The **window placements**, especially the vertical and horizontal arrangements, must stay consistent with the original.
- The **roof shapes**, including gables and dormers, must retain their silhouette.
- The **presence of flower boxes** on the right building’s balcony is a distinctive decorative detail.
- The **stone foundations** and **metal railings** along the canal banks contribute to authenticity and must be preserved in form, even if rendered differently.

Therefore, the following elements must remain unchanged in structure and position:

**Preservation Targets List:**
- The half-timbered framework pattern (dark beams on light background) on all buildings
- The shape and placement of the gabled roofs and dormer windows
- The presence and position of the pedestrian bridge spanning the canal
- The reflective surface of the water showing mirrored images of buildings
- The arrangement of windows and doors on each building facade
- The stone base of the buildings and metal railing along the canal
- The flower boxes on the balcony of the right-side building
- The general layout of the canal running between two rows of buildings

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The half-timbered framework with dark wooden beams forming geometric patterns against light plaster is the defining architectural feature of Alsatian buildings. This pattern is essential for identifying the region and style; altering its structure would make the buildings unrecognizable as half-timbered. Therefore, the presence and configuration of these beams must be preserved regardless of texture enhancement or color change.
    Question: Are the dark wooden beams forming geometric patterns on the facades of the buildings clearly visible and structurally accurate?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The steeply pitched gabled roofs with dormer windows are characteristic of traditional Alsatian architecture. These roof forms define the skyline and distinguish the buildings from other styles. Their silhouette must be preserved to maintain the identity of the scene, even if materials or colors are modified.
    Question: Do the buildings feature steeply pitched gabled roofs with dormer windows positioned at regular intervals?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The pedestrian bridge across the canal serves as a key functional and compositional element, connecting the two sides and providing depth. Its position and basic structure are critical to the spatial logic of the scene. Even if scaled down in a diorama, its presence and alignment must remain consistent.
    Question: Is there a pedestrian bridge spanning the canal in the mid-ground, connecting the two sides of the street?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The reflective surface of the water is a central aesthetic feature, mirroring the buildings and sky. Although the water may be replaced with resin, its reflective quality must be preserved to maintain visual coherence and realism. Loss of reflection would break the illusion of a calm canal environment.
    Question: Does the canal surface reflect the surrounding buildings and sky with clear, mirror-like fidelity?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The flower boxes on the balcony of the right-hand building are distinctive decorative elements that add charm and regional character. They are visually identifiable and contribute to the authenticity of the scene. Their presence and placement must be retained even if stylized in a diorama.
    Question: Are there flower boxes containing green plants visible along the balcony of the large building on the right side?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The stone foundations and metal railings along the canal edge provide structural grounding and historical authenticity. These elements anchor the buildings to the ground and define the walkway boundary. Their form must be preserved to maintain the scene’s realism and spatial integrity.
    Question: Are stone bases and metal railings present along the canal edges beneath the buildings?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The window arrangements—particularly the vertical alignment and rectangular shape—are consistent across buildings and contribute to the architectural rhythm. Altering their positions or numbers would disrupt the visual harmony and misrepresent the original design.
    Question: Are the windows arranged in vertical and horizontal lines on the facades, matching the timber frame divisions?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
