      "thinking_process": "The sun-shaped ceiling light fixture is a unique and iconic feature of the original room, serving both as a functional light source and a distinctive decorative element. Its shape—a bright circular center surrounded by radiating triangular rays—forms a clear visual signature. If this element were removed or altered, the room’s identity and ambiance would fundamentally shift, making it unrecognizable from the original. Therefore, preserving its exact shape and position is critical for maintaining the room’s core visual identity.",

      "thinking_process": "The bedside table is a key functional component placed adjacent to the bed, supporting the lamp and flower arrangement. Its position relative to the bed defines the room’s asymmetrical yet balanced composition. Altering its location or removing it would break the spatial logic of the scene, affecting how the viewer interprets the room’s layout and functionality. Thus, retaining its placement and form is essential for structural coherence.",

      "thinking_process": "The dark rectangular rug under the bed serves as a grounding element, anchoring the bed visually and contributing to the room’s warmth and comfort. Its placement directly beneath the bed is intentional and consistent with standard interior design practices. Removing or relocating it would disrupt the spatial hierarchy and diminish the sense of order in the room. As a fixed environmental detail, it must be preserved.",
      "question": "Is there a dark rectangular rug positioned directly beneath the bed?",

      "thinking_process": "The window with sheer white curtains allows natural light to enter and contributes to the room’s airy and inviting atmosphere. Its position on the left side of the image establishes depth and perspective. Any change to its location or covering would alter the lighting dynamics and visual flow of the space, undermining the original scene’s realism and balance. Hence, its presence and position must be retained.",
      "question": "Is there a window with sheer white curtains visible on the left side of the room?",

      "thinking_process": "The tiled floor with light beige square tiles provides a neutral base for the room’s decor and reflects the ambient lighting. Its texture and color contribute to the overall warmth and cleanliness of the space. Changing the floor type or color would significantly affect the room’s mood and visual harmony. Since the instruction does not specify any modification to the flooring, it must be preserved as an essential environmental detail.",
      "question": "Are the floor tiles light beige in color and arranged in a square grid pattern?",

      "thinking_process": "The lamp on the bedside table features a distinctive patterned shade with metallic accents and emits a warm glow, casting shadow patterns on the wall. This specific design contributes to the room’s cozy ambiance and matches the aesthetic of the other furnishings. Replacing it would change the lighting character and visual rhythm of the space. Thus, its presence and design must be maintained.",
