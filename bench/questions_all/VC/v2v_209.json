      "thinking_process": "The rockers are the defining functional feature of a rocking chair. Their curved, elongated shape at the base enables the rocking motion and is the most distinctive identifier separating it from stationary chairs. If the rockers are absent or altered into straight legs, the chair loses its fundamental identity. This is a core recognition element, and its absence would render the object unrecognizable as a rocking chair. Therefore, it is assigned a weight of 3 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The spindle-back design, consisting of multiple vertical slats between the top and bottom rails, is a hallmark of traditional wooden rocking chairs. This pattern is visually distinctive and contributes significantly to the chair’s identity. Removing or replacing the spindles with solid panels would fundamentally alter the chair’s appearance and classification. Thus, the presence and arrangement of the spindles are key to recognition and must be preserved. This is a core structural feature, hence a weight of 3 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The armrests are curved and attached to the front legs with turned supports, forming a classic design element. Their shape and placement are important for both aesthetics and functionality. While the instruction allows simplification, the basic curved form must remain to preserve the chair’s silhouette. Altering the armrests into straight bars or removing them would disrupt the chair’s balanced profile. This is an important structural component, so it is assigned a weight of 2 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The finials at the top of the back posts are small but distinctive decorative elements that add to the chair’s traditional style. They are part of the chair’s visual signature and help identify it as a classic wooden rocking chair. While minor in scale, their absence would reduce the authenticity of the design. Since they are not mentioned as removable in the instructions, they must be retained. This is a secondary but identifiable detail, thus a weight of 1 point.",

      "thinking_process": "The overall silhouette of the chair—its height, width, and proportion between the back, seat, and legs—is crucial for maintaining its identity. A significant distortion in proportions (e.g., making the back too short or the seat too wide) would make it unrecognizable. The instruction requires the design to be “based on” the chair, implying proportional fidelity. This is a key visual cue for identification, so it is assigned a weight of 2 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The connection between the legs and rockers is essential for the rocking mechanism. The rockers are attached to the legs via a continuous, curved joint that allows movement. This structural relationship must be preserved to maintain the functional logic of the chair. Even in a stylized form, the link between the legs and rockers must be clear. This is a functional and structural element, so it is assigned a weight of 2 points.",
