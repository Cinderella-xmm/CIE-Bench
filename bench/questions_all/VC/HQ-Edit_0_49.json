      "thinking_process": "The curved spout with a pointed tip is a key structural feature of the teapot, distinguishing it from other vessels. Its shape is unique and essential for identification. If replaced with a straight or blunt spout, the object would no longer resemble the original. Therefore, preserving the exact curvature and pointed end is critical for maintaining identity.",
      "question": "Does the teapot retain the original curved spout with a sharply pointed tip?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The ornate handle with leaf-like flourishes is a defining characteristic of the teapot's decorative style. It contributes significantly to the baroque aesthetic and is structurally distinct. Altering its shape or removing the flourishes would compromise the visual integrity of the original design.",
      "question": "Is the handle shaped with elaborate leaf-like embellishments and a looping baroque form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The domed lid with a finial at the top is a core component of the teapot’s silhouette. The finial’s shape — resembling a stylized acorn or knob — is a signature detail. Removing or simplifying it would make the object visually incomplete and unrecognizable as the original.",
      "question": "Does the lid feature a domed shape with a finial at the apex that matches the original stylized knob form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The intricate floral and scroll engravings cover the body and are central to the teapot’s artistic identity. These patterns are not random but follow a symmetrical, ornamental design. Any deviation in motif or placement would break the visual consistency and reduce authenticity.",
      "question": "Are the floral and scroll engravings present across the body in their original symmetrical and raised configuration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The flared base with a textured band is a distinctive structural element that anchors the teapot’s design. Its presence and pattern contribute to the balance and completeness of the object. Changing or omitting this base would disrupt the overall proportion and visual harmony.",
      "question": "Does the teapot rest on a flared base with a clearly defined textured band matching the original design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The reflective metallic surface with warm golden highlights indicates the material and lighting interaction. While the lighting may shift due to the glass dome, the inherent reflectivity and color tone (silver/pewter with golden reflections) must be preserved to maintain the original material appearance.",
      "question": "Is the teapot's surface still reflective with visible golden highlights consistent with the original metallic sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The overall rounded, bulbous form of the body is a fundamental shape that defines the teapot’s silhouette. Altering this into a cylindrical or angular form would fundamentally change the object’s identity. Even in miniature, this form must remain.",
      "question": "Does the body of the teapot maintain its original rounded, bulbous shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
