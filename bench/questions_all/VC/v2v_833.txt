### Step 1 - Description of Reference Image and Allowed Changes List:

**Description of Reference Image:**  
The subject is a seated figure reminiscent of the Mona Lisa, with long, dark hair and a subtle smile. The subject holds a mug with both hands, positioned at a rustic wooden table. On the table, there is a plate with a pancake topped with berries, a loaf of bread, and a small vase containing a daisy. The background features a window with sheer curtains allowing natural light to filter through, casting soft shadows on the wall. The overall atmosphere is serene and inviting.

**Thinking Process:**  
The instructions specify transforming the subject into a 3D cartoon style while retaining the breakfast scene. The scene's core elements—coffee, pancakes, bread, and flower—must be kept. The subject's iconic pose and expression should also be preserved. However, the background and lighting can be adjusted to fit the new style.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
- Subject rendered in 3D cartoon style with soft lighting and vibrant personality.  
- Background transformed to match the new style, including window and curtains.  
- Addition of RPG-style elements like stats/skill bars, title banner, and nameplate.  
- Adjustment of color tones and lighting to create a warm, cozy atmosphere.

### Step 2 - Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged:

**Thinking Process:**  
Core recognition elements include the subject's iconic pose and expression, as well as the breakfast items on the table. Functional/logical elements involve the subject holding the mug and the arrangement of food items. Remaining elements like the vase and daisy contribute to the scene's coherence.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
- Subject's iconic pose and expression.  
- Subject holding the mug.  
- Presence of pancakes with berries, bread, and vase with a daisy on the table.  
- Table and its rustic wooden texture.
