### Step 1 - Description of Reference Image and Allowed Changes List:

**Description of Reference Image:**  
The subject is a skier dressed in a bright red jacket, black pants, gloves, and a black helmet with goggles. He is actively skiing downhill on a snowy slope, holding ski poles in both hands. The background consists of snow-covered mountains under a clear blue sky. The skierâ€™s posture suggests dynamic movement, leaning forward with knees bent.

**Thinking Process:**  
The editing instructions specify transforming the snowy mountain scene into a brightly colored tropical beach setting and changing the skier into a surfer riding vibrant waves. This means the background, the skier's activity, and the environment can be altered significantly. However, certain elements tied to the skier's identity and posture may still need to be considered.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
1. The snowy mountain scene can be replaced with a tropical beach setting.  
2. The skier can be transformed into a surfer, including changing the skis into a surfboard and adjusting the posture accordingly.  
3. The color scheme can be adjusted to match the vibrant tones of a tropical beach.

### Step 2 - Determination of Elements That Should Remain Unchanged:

**Thinking Process:**  
- **Core Recognition Elements:** The skier's posture and action dynamics are crucial for recognizing the subject's activity. Even though the activity changes from skiing to surfing, the dynamic posture should be retained to maintain the sense of motion.  
- **Functional/Logical Association Elements:** The skier's equipment (skis and poles) will be replaced with a surfboard, but the way the subject interacts with the new equipment should logically align with surfing.  
- **Remaining Elements:** The skier's attire (jacket, pants, gloves, helmet, and goggles) should be retained in some form to maintain visual coherence, even if adapted for a beach setting.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
1. The dynamic posture and sense of motion.  
2. The interaction with the new equipment (surfboard).  
3. The skier's attire adapted for the new setting.

### Step 3 - Generation of Yes/No Questions:

**Q1:**  
Thinking process: The dynamic posture is a core recognition feature that distinguishes the subject's active engagement in an outdoor sport. Losing this would make the subject appear static and lose the essence of the activity.  
Question: Does the edited image retain the dynamic posture of the subject, showing a forward-leaning stance with bent knees?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3

**Q2:**  
Thinking process: The interaction with the equipment is essential for maintaining the logical connection between the subject and the activity. The skier's hands were originally holding ski poles; now they should be interacting with the surfboard.  
Question: Does the edited image show the subject's hands interacting with the surfboard in a manner consistent with surfing?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2

**Q3:**  
Thinking process: The skier's attire is a key visual element that helps identify the subject. While the specific items may change, their presence in some form is necessary for visual coherence.  
Question: Does the edited image retain the skier's attire in some form, such as a wetsuit or beach-appropriate clothing?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2

**Q4:**  
Thinking process: The skier's protective gear (helmet and goggles) is a distinctive feature that contributes to the subject's identity. These should be adapted for the new setting while retaining their function.  
Question: Does the edited image include some form of protective gear on the subject, such as a helmet or goggles adapted for surfing?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2

**Q5:**  
Thinking process: The vibrant color scheme is a minor detail that enhances the visual appeal but does not affect the core identity. Ensuring the colors are bright and appropriate for a tropical beach maintains visual consistency.  
Question: Does the edited image feature a vibrant color scheme appropriate for a tropical beach setting?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1

These questions focus on retaining the core visual elements of the original image while adapting them to the new setting as specified in the editing instructions.
