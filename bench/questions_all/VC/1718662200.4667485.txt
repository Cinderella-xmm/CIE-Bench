**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

Description of reference image:  
The subject is a pig with large, upright ears and a round snout, wearing red circular sunglasses and a red short-sleeved shirt. The pig is positioned behind a professional DJ turntable setup, with its front hooves placed on the platter and mixer controls. It has black over-ear headphones draped around its neck. The background features blurred disco lights in red, blue, and pink hues, suggesting a lively club or party environment. The lighting is dramatic, with a spotlight effect from above-left casting soft highlights on the pig’s face and body. The pig's expression is cheerful, with a slight smile and visible teeth, contributing to a playful and anthropomorphic character design.

Thinking process:  
The editing instructions specify transforming the image into a **cartoon-style postcard series**, with the following changes allowed:
- **Change proportions**: Larger head, smaller body.
- **Change accessories**: Replace red sunglasses with green ones for one pose.
- **Change poses**: Include dancing with tambourine, holding microphone, DJing.
- **Change background**: Use disco-themed watercolor backgrounds.
- **Add elements**: Blank chat bubbles framed by soundwave patterns.
- **Style shift**: Cartoon style.

From this, we can infer:
- The **subject (pig)** remains central but can be **stylized** and **proportionally altered**.
- The **sunglasses color** can change (from red to green).
- The **pose** and **accessories** (tambourine, microphone) are variable across the series.
- The **background** is not required to remain the same — it can be replaced with watercolor disco themes.
- **New elements** like chat bubbles and soundwaves are to be added, indicating they are not part of the original.

Thus, only elements **not explicitly mentioned as changeable** must be preserved.

Allowed Changes List:  
- Pig’s head-to-body proportion (can be exaggerated)
- Sunglasses color (can be changed to green)
- Pose (DJing, dancing, singing)
- Background (can be replaced with watercolor disco scenes)
- Accessories (tambourine, microphone, chat bubbles, soundwaves)
- Artistic style (can be cartoonified)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

Thinking process:  
We now exclude all elements listed in the "Allowed Changes List" and identify what remains in the original image that **must be preserved** due to their role in identity, function, or coherence.

**Core recognition elements**:  
- The **pig** as the subject must remain identifiable. Even if stylized, its core identity as a pig must be retained — this includes **snout shape**, **ear structure**, **overall facial features**, and **skin texture** (pink skin, visible pores). These are essential for recognition.
- The **DJ setup** (turntable, platter, tonearm, mixer knobs) is functional and contextually critical. Although poses may change, the **presence of DJ equipment** is implied in at least one version (the DJing pose), so the **functional form** of the turntable must remain consistent in that instance. This is a logical association — a DJ needs a turntable.
- The **red sunglasses** are iconic in the original image and serve as a key visual marker. While the instruction allows changing them to green in one variation, **in the original image**, the **red color and round shape** must be preserved unless specifically modified. Since the instruction says “adjusting” for different poses, the **original red sunglasses** are a defining feature of the base image.

**Functional/logical association elements**:  
- The **connection between the pig and the turntable** must be preserved in the DJ pose — the pig’s hands must be interacting with the equipment. If the turntable were removed or distorted beyond recognition, the action becomes illogical.
- The **headphones** around the neck are part of the DJ aesthetic and are functionally linked to music production. They should remain present even if stylized.

**Non-modified element deduction**:  
After removing allowed changes:
- The **shape and position of the ears** (large, floppy, pink) must remain.
- The **snout** (round, two nostrils, slightly protruding) must be preserved.
- The **texture of the skin** (smooth, slightly shiny, with natural folds) contributes to realism and identity.
- The **red shirt** is part of the outfit and adds to the character’s visual identity; although color might be adjusted in cartoon style, its presence and basic shape should remain.
- The **lighting direction** (spotlight from upper left) and **shadow placement** are not mentioned as changeable, so they contribute to depth and consistency and should be maintained in the original context.

Preservation Targets List:  
- Pig’s snout shape (round, two nostrils, pink)  
- Pig’s ear structure (large, upright, pink, with inner details)  
- Red round sunglasses (color and shape)  
- DJ turntable with platter, tonearm, and mixer controls  
- Headphones around neck (black, over-ear)  
- Red short-sleeved shirt (collar, sleeves)  
- Pig’s hand placement on turntable (interaction with equipment)  
- Pink skin texture with subtle wrinkles and shine

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

Q1:  
Thinking process: The pig’s snout is a core identification feature — its round shape, pink color, and dual nostrils are biologically unique to pigs and distinguish it from other animals. Losing this would make the subject unrecognizable as a pig. This is a 3-point weight because it is essential for species identification.  
Question: Is the pig’s snout clearly visible with two distinct nostrils and a rounded, pink shape?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The large, upright ears with visible inner pink structure are iconic to the pig’s appearance and help distinguish it from other animals. Their shape and position are key to visual recognition. Altering them significantly would compromise identity. This is a 3-point weight due to its role in species-specific morphology.  
Question: Are the pig’s ears large, upright, and pink with visible inner ear details?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The red round sunglasses are a signature accessory in the original image, contributing both style and character identity. While the instruction allows changing them to green in another version, in the original image, the **red color and round lens shape** must be preserved. This is a 3-point weight because it is a distinctive visual identifier of the character.  
Question: Are the sunglasses red in color with round lenses and a thin frame?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The DJ turntable is a functional object tied to the pig’s role as a DJ. Its presence and interaction with the pig’s hands are crucial for maintaining logical coherence. The platter, tonearm, and mixer controls are specific components that define the equipment. Removing or distorting these would break the scene’s logic. This is a 2-point weight as it is important for scene functionality.  
Question: Is there a black turntable with a silver platter, tonearm, and mixer controls beneath the pig’s hands?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The black over-ear headphones around the pig’s neck are part of the DJ aesthetic and provide continuity in the character’s role. Their presence supports the musical theme and is visually distinct. While stylization may occur, the basic shape and position must remain. This is a 2-point weight as it is a key accessory tied to function.  
Question: Are black over-ear headphones draped around the pig’s neck?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The pig’s red short-sleeved shirt with collar and sleeves defines its outfit and contributes to the character’s visual identity. Although the instruction allows cartoon styling, the shirt’s presence and basic form should be retained. This is a 1-point weight as it is a minor detail but still aids in character consistency.  
Question: Does the pig wear a red short-sleeved shirt with a visible collar and sleeves?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The pig’s hands are positioned on the turntable platter and mixer, indicating active DJing. This interaction is essential for the scene’s logic. If the hands were absent or mispositioned, the action would be unclear. This is a 2-point weight due to its functional importance.  
Question: Are the pig’s front hooves placed on the turntable platter and mixer controls?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q8:  
Thinking process: The pig’s skin texture — smooth, pink, with subtle wrinkles and light reflection — contributes to realism and distinguishes it from flat cartoon rendering. While the instruction allows cartoon style, the original texture should be preserved unless explicitly altered. This is a 1-point weight as it is a detail-level element affecting visual fidelity.  
Question: Is the pig’s skin pink with visible texture, including subtle wrinkles and light reflection?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1
