      "thinking_process": "The tricorne hat is a defining feature of the historical figure’s identity. Its shape—a three-cornered hat with a distinct brim—and the color contrast between the black crown and beige trim are unique identifiers. In chibi style, even if simplified, the basic triangular form and color division must remain to preserve recognition. Loss of this would make the character unidentifiable as a historical naval/military leader. Therefore, it is a core identity element.",

      "thinking_process": "The dark blue coat with gold buttons and trim is central to the figure’s authoritative appearance. The specific arrangement of gold buttons in multiple rows is a functional and symbolic detail of military dress. Even in stylized form, the color (dark blue) and gold embellishments must remain to maintain the visual link to the original. Altering the coat’s base color or removing the gold trim would fundamentally change the identity.",

      "thinking_process": "The white ruffled cravat is a key accessory that distinguishes the formal 18th-century attire. It is positioned at the neck and extends down the chest. While it may be simplified in chibi form, its presence and white color are necessary to maintain authenticity. Removing it would reduce the historical accuracy of the costume.",

The original image features shiny, circular gold coins, and the instruction specifies \"sparkling gold coins,\" implying preservation of their visual properties. The color and metallic texture are essential to the theme of wealth and treasure.",
