      "thinking_process": "The key recognition feature of the sheep is its **four-legged mammalian body structure**, which distinguishes it from other animals. Even in chibi form, the number of legs and general body plan must remain consistent to maintain identity. Losing this would make it unrecognizable as a sheep. This is a core identity element, hence weight 3.",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the sheep's four-legged body structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The **woolly coat** is a defining characteristic of sheep, especially in this image where the texture is prominent. While the style may be simplified in chibi form, the presence of wool-like covering must be preserved to maintain species recognition. This is a core visual trait, so it carries high weight.",
      "question": "Is the sheep covered in a woolly coat resembling curly fleece?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The **facial features** of the sheep — including ears, eyes, nose, and mouth — are essential for identifying it as a sheep rather than another animal. In chibi style, these may be exaggerated, but they must still be present and recognizable. Their absence would compromise identification.",
      "question": "Are the sheep’s ears, eyes, nose, and mouth clearly visible and positioned in a way consistent with a real sheep?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The **circular face** of the clock is its most basic structural feature. Without it, the object would not be recognizable as a clock. Even if stylized, the round shape must be preserved. This is a core identity element.",
      "question": "Does the clock retain a circular face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The **numerical markings (1–12)** on the clock face are critical for identifying it as a timepiece. These are not decorative but functional. Even in chibi form, the numbers must be present and arranged in a standard clockwise sequence. Their absence would render the object unrecognizable as a clock.",
      "question": "Are the numbers 1 through 12 present on the clock face in a clockwise arrangement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The **hour and minute hands** are essential components of an analog clock. They indicate time and are necessary for functional recognition. The second hand is less critical but often included. Since the original shows 10:10, this specific time may be preserved as a stylistic consistency point. The presence of hands is a key functional element.",
      "question": "Are the hour and minute hands visible on the clock face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The **time displayed (10:10)** is a common default setting in clock imagery and may be considered a stylistic anchor. While not strictly necessary for identity, preserving it maintains continuity with the original image. It is a minor but notable detail.",
      "question": "Does the clock show the time as 10:10?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "thinking_process": "The **relative proximity** of the sheep and clock in the original image suggests a deliberate pairing. Even if repositioned in the snow globe, they must remain together as a unit. This spatial relationship is important for maintaining the original conceptual pairing.",
      "question": "Are the sheep and clock positioned close to each other within the same scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
