Description of reference image: The subject is a ceiling fan with four blades, featuring a metallic finish. The fan has a central hub from which the blades extend symmetrically. Each blade is rectangular and appears to have a brushed metal texture. The fan is mounted on a ceiling via a cylindrical stem that connects to a dome-shaped canopy. The background is plain and light-colored, providing no additional context or detail.

Thinking process: First, analyze the instructions that clearly state what can be changed, such as transforming the ceiling fan into a snow globe scene. This involves changing the form of the fan, its environment, and adding new elements like snowflakes and a cartoon-style design. The exterior setting specifies a tabletop under soft lighting with a warm and minimalist background, allowing for changes in the overall scene. Adjustments like quantity, proportion, angle, etc., are also permissible within these guidelines.

Allowed Changes List:
Specific element 1 that allows for changes: The form and style of the ceiling fan (changing it into a playful, cartoon-style 3D design).
Specific element 2 that allows for changes: The background and scene environment (replacing it with a tabletop under soft lighting with a warm and minimalist background).
Specific element 3 that allows for changes: Adding new elements like snowflakes and a tiny room inside the snow globe.
Specific element 4 that allows for changes: The proportions and angles of the fan blades and other components.

Step 2- Determine the elements that should remain unchanged

Thinking process:
Explain the criteria for determining the core recognition elements: The iconic shape and structure of the ceiling fan must be retained so that it can still be recognized as a fan even after being transformed into a cartoon-style 3D design. The functional/logical association elements, such as the number of blades and their arrangement, need to be preserved to maintain the logical consistency of the fan's design. Remaining elements based on visual coherence and common sense include the metallic texture and color scheme of the fan, which contribute to its identity.

Preservation Targets List:â€‹
(Element 1 that should be maintained): The number of fan blades (four blades).
(Element 2 that should be maintained): The central hub structure of the fan.
(Element 3 that should be maintained): The metallic texture and color scheme of the fan.

Q1: 
Thinking process: The number of fan blades is a key identifying feature because it directly relates to the fan's structure and function. Losing this detail would make it difficult to recognize the object as a ceiling fan.
Question: Does the edited image retain the original four blades of the ceiling fan?
Choices: yes, no
A: yes
Weight: 3

Q2: 
Thinking process: The central hub structure is crucial for maintaining the logical consistency of the fan's design. It serves as the focal point connecting all the blades.
Question: Is the central hub structure of the ceiling fan still present in the edited image?
Choices: yes, no
A: yes
Weight: 3

Q3: 
Thinking process: The metallic texture and color scheme are important for retaining the visual identity of the fan. These details help distinguish it from other objects.
Question: Does the edited image preserve the metallic texture and color scheme of the ceiling fan?
Choices: yes, no
A: yes
Weight: 2

Q4: 
Thinking process: The symmetrical arrangement of the blades is a secondary detail that contributes to the fan's visual coherence. Maintaining this symmetry helps ensure the fan looks balanced and recognizable.
Question: Are the blades arranged symmetrically around the central hub in the edited image?
Choices: yes, no
A: yes
Weight: 2

Q5: 
Thinking process: The connection points between the blades and the central hub are minor details but essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the fan's design.
Question: Are the connection points between the blades and the central hub visible in the edited image?
Choices: yes, no
A: yes
