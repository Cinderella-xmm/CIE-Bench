      "thinking_process": "The gold crown is a core identity feature of the Three Wise Men, symbolizing their royal status. Its presence and shape (especially the ornate design and placement atop the head) are essential for identifying them as kings. In traditional depictions, this crown is always present and clearly visible. Removing or altering it would make the figures unrecognizable as Magi, hence it is a key identification element with a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the gold crown present on the head of each of the three figures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The dark beards and facial hair are distinctive traits in traditional representations of the Magi, especially in Western art. They contribute to the recognition of these figures as wise men of foreign origin. Altering or removing the beards would significantly affect their identity. Since the instruction does not specify any change to facial features, they must be retained. This is a core recognition element, thus weighted at 3 points.",
      "question": "Do all three figures have prominent dark beards?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The clothing colors and trims are critical for distinguishing each king and aligning with traditional iconography (e.g., purple, red, green robes with gold accents). The instruction mentions enhancing “deep, rich hues,” which implies retention of the original palette, not replacement. Changing the primary colors would misrepresent the figures. These colors are essential for visual identification and thematic consistency, so they are important scene-related elements, weighted at 2 points.",
      "question": "Are the robes of the figures colored in purple/green, red/white/gold, and green/blue respectively, with gold trim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "Each figure holds a symbolic gift: a golden vessel, a golden box, or a golden orb. These objects are central to their narrative role in the Nativity. Their presence and type are non-negotiable for maintaining the story's integrity. Even within a snow globe, these items must remain unchanged. This is a functional element tied to their identity and purpose, making it a high-priority preservation target with a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Does each figure hold a golden object (vessel, box, or orb)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The hand positions—holding gifts, clasping hands—reflect their gestures of reverence and offering. These are key to interpreting their actions in the scene. Altering them would distort the narrative meaning. While the instruction allows for repositioning within a globe, the actual gesture must remain consistent. This is a logical-functional detail, essential for coherence, hence weighted at 2 points.",
      "question": "Are the hands of the central figure clasped over the chest, and do the other two figures hold their gifts with both hands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The relative size and posture of the figures (left leaning, center small and reverent, right upright) contribute to their individual characterization and visual balance. While the instruction allows repositioning, the intrinsic proportions and poses must be preserved to maintain recognition. These are secondary but identifiable features that aid in distinguishing the figures. Though not core, they are important for visual consistency, thus weighted at 1 point.",
      "question": "Is the central figure noticeably smaller than the other two, and is he standing upright with hands clasped?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
