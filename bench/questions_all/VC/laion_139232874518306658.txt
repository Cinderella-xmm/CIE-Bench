Description of reference image: The subject is a woman standing outdoors in a bright, sunlit environment, facing slightly to the right with her head turned toward the camera. She wears large black sunglasses with reflective lenses and bold red lipstick. Her hair is styled neatly, pulled back from her face. She is dressed in a burgundy coat with a high collar and visible zipper details, layered over a light pink turtleneck sweater and dark gray skirt. She wears black leather gloves and holds multiple shopping bags in both hands—these bags vary in color (white, black, red, blue, brown) and material (paper, glossy plastic), with some featuring handles in contrasting colors. The background is a plain, light-colored wall with abstract curved shadows or lines, suggesting architectural elements or sunlight patterns. The lighting is strong and directional, casting sharp highlights and shadows on her clothing and face.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions word by word to determine what can be changed:
- "Enlarge the shopping bags, turning them into vibrant geometric patterns" → This indicates the form, size, and design of the shopping bags are allowed to change.
- "Convert the coat into a velvety texture with a darker crimson tone" → The texture and color of the coat are permitted to be altered.
- "Change the gloves to a sleek, glossy finish" → The surface appearance of the gloves can be modified.
- "Surround the subject with illustrated abstract retail symbols on a smooth, matte card" → The background and surrounding elements are to be replaced entirely with new illustrative content.
- "With an open panel for personal messages" → Implies a new structural element (card format) will be introduced, not preserving the original scene.

Thus, the following elements are explicitly allowed to change:
- Shape, size, and pattern of shopping bags
- Texture and color of the coat
- Surface finish of gloves
- Background environment and spatial context
- Overall composition and framing (to fit postcard format)

Allowed Changes List:
- Shopping bag forms, sizes, and designs (including their transformation into geometric patterns)
- Coat texture and shade (from wool-like to velvet, and from burgundy to darker crimson)
- Glove material finish (from leather to glossy)
- Background setting (replaced with abstract retail symbols and matte card layout)
- Composition structure (transition to art postcard format with message panel)

Step 2 - Determine the elements that should remain unchanged

Thinking process:
Core recognition elements: The identity of the subject hinges on key visual traits such as facial features (especially the sunglasses, red lips, and hairstyle), posture (standing upright, holding bags), and general attire silhouette. These are not mentioned for modification, so they must be preserved. For example, the presence of the red lipstick and black sunglasses is critical for recognizing the character’s stylized fashion persona. If these were removed or altered beyond recognition, the essence of the subject would be lost.

Functional/logical association elements: The action of carrying shopping bags is central to the narrative of a fashion shopping scene. Even though the bags themselves may be transformed, the fact that she is holding them in both hands remains essential for logical coherence—the gesture implies recent shopping activity. Thus, the hand positions and grip must remain consistent with the original pose.

Non-modified element deduction: After excluding changes to bags, coat texture, gloves, and background, remaining unmentioned visual elements include:
- The woman's facial expression (confident, slightly upward gaze)
- Hairline and style (pulled back, neat, short length)
- Sunglasses shape and position (large, rectangular frames covering eyes)
- Lip color (bright red)
- Turtleneck color and visibility (light pink, under coat)
- Skirt color and silhouette (dark gray, mid-length)
- Position of arms and body orientation (slightly angled, facing right but looking at viewer)
- Lighting direction (strong sunlight from upper left, creating distinct shadows)

These elements are not specified for change and are necessary to maintain visual continuity and identity.

Preservation Targets List:
- Facial features: red lipstick, black sunglasses, neutral expression
- Hair: pulled-back short hairstyle
- Body posture: standing upright, arms extended outward holding bags
- Clothing layers: light pink turtleneck under burgundy coat, dark gray skirt
- Hand positioning: both hands gripping shopping bag handles
- Lighting and shadow direction: strong directional light from upper left
- Original proportions and scale of the figure relative to background

Q1:  
Thinking process: The red lipstick is a core visual identifier of the subject’s fashion-forward persona. It is a distinct, saturated color that contrasts sharply with skin tone and serves as a signature feature in the original image. Its presence is crucial for maintaining the subject’s recognizable identity; if omitted or changed to a different shade, the character’s distinctive look would be compromised. Therefore, this is a key identification feature and must be retained exactly as seen in the original image.  
Question: Is the subject wearing bright red lipstick?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The black sunglasses are another defining feature of the subject’s appearance. Their large, angular shape and reflective lenses contribute significantly to the overall fashion aesthetic. They are positioned centrally on the face and cover the eyes, which is essential for maintaining the subject’s composed, stylish demeanor. Any alteration in shape, color, or placement would disrupt facial recognition and the intended mood. Hence, this is a core identity element.  
Question: Are the sunglasses black with a rectangular frame and reflective lenses?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The subject’s hairstyle—short, neatly pulled back from the face—is a unique detail contributing to her polished appearance. This specific grooming style distinguishes her from other figures and supports the fashion theme. Changing it would alter her visual identity and reduce consistency with the original portrayal. While not as iconic as the lipstick or glasses, it is still a key facial framing element.  
Question: Is the subject’s hair pulled back tightly, revealing her forehead and ears?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The woman is holding shopping bags in both hands, which is a functional and narrative element of the scene. The act of carrying bags defines the context of shopping and fashion consumption. Even though the bags themselves may be redesigned, the physical gesture—hands gripping handles, arms extended—must remain intact to preserve the logic of the action. Altering hand position would break the coherence of the scene.  
Question: Are both hands visibly gripping the handles of shopping bags?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The light pink turtleneck is visible beneath the coat and provides contrast to the darker outerwear. Its color and snug fit are part of the outfit’s layered structure. Since the instruction only modifies the coat’s texture and color, not the inner garment, this element must remain unchanged. It contributes to the fashion ensemble and helps define the subject’s clothing hierarchy.  
Question: Is a light pink turtleneck visible underneath the coat?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The dark gray skirt is a secondary but identifiable component of the outfit. Its color and mid-length cut are consistent with the overall sophisticated fashion look. It anchors the lower half of the figure and balances the upper body styling. Although not as prominent as the coat or accessories, its retention ensures full fidelity to the original attire.  
Question: Is the subject wearing a dark gray skirt?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The lighting direction creates strong shadows on the right side of the face and body, indicating a light source from the upper left. This directional illumination is a key compositional element that adds depth and drama. Preserving the shadow placement ensures the three-dimensional quality of the figure remains consistent, even if the background changes.  
Question: Is there a strong shadow cast on the right side of the subject’s face and body?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2
