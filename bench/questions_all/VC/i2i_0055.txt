### Step 2 - Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged:

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements:  
- The background setting must remain consistent with the train and fence as it provides context for the subject.  
Functional/logical association elements:  
- The posture and context of the person's interaction with the phone must be preserved.  

Non-modified element deduction:  
- Retain the attire of the worker, including the reflective vest, helmet, and other details, ensuring visual coherence and recognition.

Preservation Targets List:  
(Background train and fence)  
(Posture and phone interaction)  
(Worker’s attire)
