**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a hummingbird in mid-flight, positioned centrally in the frame, facing right toward a hanging red hummingbird feeder. The bird has iridescent green plumage on its body, with a shimmering purple throat patch (gorget), long thin beak, and rapidly blurred wings showing pinkish-purple and white edges. Its tail feathers are layered in shades of blue, green, and black. The bird’s wings are spread wide, capturing motion. The background features a lush garden scene: vibrant flowers in pink, yellow, red, and purple hues; a winding grassy path leading into a misty forested area; a small wooden table with tea cups and saucers on the right; and two houses partially visible on either side, one teal-colored with white trim on the left, and another gray-blue structure on the right covered in ivy. Overhead, green leafy vines form an arch framing the top of the image. A clear sky is visible above, and sunlight filters through the foliage, creating a soft, natural glow.

Thinking process:  
The editing instruction specifies transforming the hummingbird into an ethereal garden spirit with specific visual modifications:
- **Wings**: Changed from feathered to iridescent glass-like, shimmering with rainbow colors.
- **Feathers**: Replaced with luminescent petals.
- **Beak**: Transformed into a crystalline spout exuding floral nectar.
- **Tail**: Replaced with trailing vines and tiny blossoms.

These changes apply only to the **hummingbird’s physical form**, specifically its anatomy and texture. The instruction does **not** mention altering the **scene**, **feeder**, **garden layout**, **flowers**, **houses**, **table**, or **lighting**. Therefore, all environmental elements—including their position, color, shape, and arrangement—are implicitly required to remain unchanged unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Allowed Changes List:  
- Hummingbird’s wing structure (feathered → glass-like, rainbow-shimmering)  
- Hummingbird’s body feathers (plumage → luminescent petals)  
- Hummingbird’s beak (thin black → crystalline spout emitting nectar)  
- Hummingbird’s tail (feathered → trailing vines with tiny blossoms)  

All other elements—such as the feeder, garden, flowers, houses, table, lighting, and composition—are not mentioned for modification and must therefore be preserved.

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements:  
The original hummingbird is a distinct biological entity recognizable by its **specific anatomical features**—including the **shape of the beak**, **wing structure**, **tail feather arrangement**, and **iridescent coloration**. However, since the instruction allows full transformation of these features, they are no longer core identity markers post-edit. But **the overall context and scene logic** must remain intact. The **position and function** of the hummingbird relative to the feeder must be preserved to maintain narrative coherence: it must still appear to be approaching or feeding from the feeder.

Functional/logical association elements:  
The **hummingbird’s interaction with the feeder** is essential. Even if transformed, the creature must remain oriented toward the feeder, maintaining spatial logic (e.g., proximity, direction). This ensures functional continuity—the spirit is still "feeding" from the same object. Thus, the **feeder’s presence, location, and design** must be retained.

Non-modified element deduction:  
All elements not listed in the allowed changes list must be preserved. These include:
- The **red hummingbird feeder** with transparent cylindrical reservoir and red base
- The **hanging string** supporting the feeder
- The **wooden round table** with four cups and saucers
- The **colorful flower beds** (pink, yellow, purple, red)
- The **pathway** leading into the forest
- The **two houses** (teal and gray-blue)
- The **ivy-covered wall** and **leafy arch overhead**
- The **sunlit sky** and **soft lighting effect**

These elements define the scene’s identity and provide contextual grounding. Removing or altering them would break the consistency between original and edited versions.

Preservation Targets List:  
- The red hummingbird feeder with transparent reservoir and red base  
- The hanging string suspending the feeder  
- The wooden round table with four cups and saucers  
- The teal house on the left with white-trimmed windows  
- The gray-blue house on the right covered in ivy  
- The winding grassy path leading into the forest  
- The overhead leafy arch formed by vines  
- The colorful flower clusters (pink, yellow, purple, red) in the foreground  
- The soft sunlight filtering through the trees  
- The positioning of the hummingbird near the feeder (spatial relationship preserved)

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

Q1:  
Thinking process: The red hummingbird feeder with its transparent cylindrical reservoir and red base is a key functional object in the scene. It defines the purpose of the hummingbird’s presence and anchors the action. If this object is altered or removed, the narrative logic collapses. Its distinct shape and color make it uniquely identifiable. Therefore, preserving its exact form is critical for scene consistency and functional coherence.  
Question: Is the red hummingbird feeder with a transparent cylindrical reservoir and red base present in the same position and form as in the original image?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The hanging string that supports the feeder is a structural detail necessary for the feeder’s suspension. Its presence maintains the physical plausibility of the setup. While minor, its absence would disrupt the logical placement of the feeder and suggest an unsupported floating object, breaking realism. It is a functional support element tied directly to the feeder.  
Question: Is the thin vertical string suspending the hummingbird feeder visible and extending upward from the feeder’s top?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The wooden round table with four metallic cups and saucers is a distinctive environmental feature. It adds human presence and scale to the garden, contrasting with nature. Its specific shape, material, and contents are unique enough to serve as a landmark within the scene. Altering it would change the garden’s character and reduce visual coherence.  
Question: Is the circular wooden table located on the right side of the image, with four cups and saucers arranged on it?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The teal house on the left with white-trimmed windows is a key architectural element that frames the left side of the scene. Its color and window design contribute to the suburban garden aesthetic. Changing it would alter the spatial balance and identity of the environment. It is a fixed background structure that must remain unmodified.  
Question: Is the teal-colored house with white-trimmed windows visible on the left side of the image?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The gray-blue house on the right, covered in dense ivy, forms a complementary architectural contrast to the left house. The ivy covering is a defining texture that contributes to the overgrown, naturalized feel of the garden. Removing or changing the ivy would affect the mood and visual rhythm of the scene.  
Question: Is the gray-blue house on the right side of the image fully covered in green ivy?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The winding grassy path leading into the misty forest serves as a compositional guide and depth indicator. It connects the foreground garden to the distant background, establishing perspective. Its presence is crucial for spatial continuity. Altering its shape or removing it would flatten the scene and disrupt the sense of depth.  
Question: Is there a narrow grassy pathway running from the foreground toward the misty forest in the background?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The overhead leafy arch formed by vines creates a natural frame around the central action. It enhances the garden’s enclosed, magical atmosphere. Its shape and density are visually prominent and contribute to the framing of the hummingbird and feeder. Removing it would eliminate a key compositional device.  
Question: Is the arch-shaped canopy of green leaves forming a frame at the top of the image?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q8:  
Thinking process: The cluster of pink, yellow, purple, and red flowers in the foreground provides color contrast and visual richness. Their specific placement and variety define the garden’s vibrancy. While individual flower types may vary slightly, their collective presence and distribution are essential for maintaining the original aesthetic.  
Question: Are there dense clusters of pink, yellow, purple, and red flowers visible in the foreground garden?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q9:  
Thinking process: The soft sunlight filtering through the trees creates a warm, glowing ambiance. This lighting condition is critical for mood and time-of-day consistency. It affects shadows, highlights, and overall tone. Preserving this lighting ensures the scene retains its serene, early-morning or late-afternoon feel.  
Question: Is the scene illuminated by soft, diffused sunlight coming from above, casting gentle highlights on the foliage and flowers?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q10:  
Thinking process: The spatial relationship between the hummingbird and the feeder is critical for narrative logic. Even if transformed, the spirit must still appear to be approaching or interacting with the feeder. This positioning maintains the original intent of the image—feeding behavior. Any significant shift in distance or orientation would break the connection.  
Question: Is the hummingbird positioned near the feeder, facing it directly, as if about to feed?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3
