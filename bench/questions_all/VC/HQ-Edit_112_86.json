      "thinking_process": "The central rose is the most prominent and iconic element of the floral design, serving as the focal point of the decoration. Its presence and specific placement at the center of the teapot’s body are essential to the visual identity of the original piece. If removed or relocated, the entire aesthetic balance and recognizability of the design would be compromised. This is a core identifying feature, hence weighted 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the large central rose still present and located at the center of the teapot's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The arrangement of leaves and smaller flowers surrounding the central rose forms a coherent botanical pattern that defines the decorative style. Altering this layout would break the visual harmony and make the design unrecognizable as a derivative of the original. This pattern is not just decorative but structurally significant, making it a key retention target with a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Are the surrounding leaves and smaller flowers arranged symmetrically around the central rose in the same configuration as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The spout's position on the left side of the teapot is a functional and compositional necessity. Changing its side would disrupt both the usability and visual balance of the object. The curved shape of the spout is also a distinctive feature that contributes to the teapot’s elegance. This spatial and morphological detail is crucial and thus carries a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the spout still positioned on the left side of the teapot and shaped with a smooth, curved extension?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The handle’s placement on the right side is essential for ergonomic and visual symmetry. While its material may change, its location and general arch shape must remain to preserve the teapot’s functional logic and balance. This is a critical structural element, so it is assigned 2 points for importance in maintaining logical consistency.",
      "question": "Is the handle still attached to the right side of the teapot and maintains an arched shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The finial on the lid is a distinctive decorative element that crowns the teapot and adds to its ornate character. Its presence and position on top of the lid are part of the object’s signature silhouette. Removing or relocating it would diminish the teapot’s identifiable form. As a key design feature, it is worth 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the finial still present on top of the lid and retains its decorative knob-like shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The lid itself, including its domed shape and the band of engraved scrollwork near the edge, is a core component of the teapot’s structure. While the texture may change, the lid must remain closed and positioned correctly to maintain the object’s integrity. This is a secondary but important element affecting functionality and appearance, thus rated 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the lid still covering the top of the teapot and retaining its domed shape with the decorative band near the rim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The overall rounded body shape of the teapot is fundamental to its identity as a traditional teapot. Any drastic change in volume or contour would make it unrecognizable. Although the material changes, the silhouette must remain consistent. This is a foundational structural feature, warranting 2 points.",
      "question": "Does the teapot retain its rounded, bulbous body shape with a smooth transition between the base and the upper section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
