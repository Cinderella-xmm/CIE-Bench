Description of reference image: The subject consists of two distinct logos positioned side by side on a solid green background. On the left is the "SEARCH FOR A STAR" logo, featuring bold black text with a blue outline and a large orange star centered within the word "STAR," where the star's points extend into the letters. The typography has a dynamic, slightly angular style with sharp edges and a 3D-like effect created by layering and shadowing. On the right is the "RISING STAR" logo, also in bold black text with a blue outline, incorporating a golden-yellow star replacing the letter "A" in "STAR." Below this logo is the "SUMO DIGITAL" branding, consisting of a red stylized "S" emblem with a white inner swirl and the words "SUMO DIGITAL" in black sans-serif font beneath it. Centered below both logos is the text "Character Art Directory 2018" in clean white sans-serif font, evenly spaced and horizontally aligned. The overall layout is symmetrical and balanced, with all elements clearly legible against the vibrant green gradient background that transitions subtly from light to dark green.

Thinking process: First, analyze the instructions that explicitly allow transformation of specific elements:  
- "Transform the 'Search for a Star' and 'Rising Star' logos into stylized, gleaming golden award statuettes" → This indicates the form, color, and material of these logos can be changed; their original typographic structure and star shapes are no longer required.  
- "Set them against a rich, dark velvet curtain background replacing the current green" → The background is explicitly replaced, so the green gradient background is not to be retained.  
- "Render the 'Sumo Digital' logo as an embossed seal on a polished wooden plaque beneath the 'Rising Star' logo" → The Sumo Digital logo’s form and placement are being modified (from flat graphic to embossed seal), and its position relative to the Rising Star logo is altered.  
- "Present the 'Character Art Directory 2018' text in elegant, engraved silver lettering" → The text content remains, but its style, color, and texture are to be changed from white sans-serif to engraved silver.

Allowed Changes List:  
- The visual form of the "Search for a Star" logo (including its typography and star shape)  
- The visual form of the "Rising Star" logo (including its typography and star shape)  
- The background color and texture (green gradient → dark velvet curtain)  
- The appearance and positioning of the "Sumo Digital" logo (flat graphic → embossed seal on wooden plaque)  
- The style, color, and texture of the "Character Art Directory 2018" text (white sans-serif → engraved silver)

Step 2 - Determine the elements that should remain unchanged

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements: Although the logos are to be transformed, the instruction does not specify changing the *identity* or *meaning* of the logos—only their visual representation. Therefore, the core identity of each logo must be preserved through recognizable features such as the presence of the star symbol, the textual content ("SEARCH FOR A STAR", "RISING STAR"), and the association with "Sumo Digital". However, since the instruction allows full transformation into statuettes and seals, only those elements that are *not* mentioned for change and are essential to the original identity must be retained. But note: the instruction says "using the provided image as a structural guide"—this implies that the spatial arrangement and relative positions of the elements may need to be preserved even if forms change.

Functional/logical association elements: The spatial relationship between the logos and the text is critical. The "Character Art Directory 2018" text is centrally located below both logos, suggesting a hierarchical layout where the logos are above and the title is below. This positional logic must be preserved to maintain coherence. Additionally, the "Sumo Digital" logo is originally placed beneath the "Rising Star" logo, which suggests a brand affiliation. Even though it will be repositioned to a wooden plaque beneath the Rising Star statuette, the *relative placement* under the Rising Star must be maintained.

Non-modified element deduction: After excluding allowed changes, the following must remain:
- The presence of the "SEARCH FOR A STAR" text (even if stylized)
- The presence of the "RISING STAR" text (even if stylized)
- The presence of the "SUMO DIGITAL" branding (even if transformed)
- The presence of the "Character Art Directory 2018" text (content must remain identical)
- The central alignment of the "Character Art Directory 2018" text
- The relative vertical stacking of the logos above the directory title
- The fact that "Sumo Digital" is associated with "Rising Star" (via placement)

Preservation Targets List:  
- The textual content "SEARCH FOR A STAR"  
- The textual content "RISING STAR"  
- The textual content "SUMO DIGITAL"  
- The textual content "Character Art Directory 2018"  
- The central horizontal alignment of the "Character Art Directory 2018" text  
- The relative vertical order: "Search for a Star" and "Rising Star" logos above the directory title  
- The placement of "Sumo Digital" beneath the "Rising Star" logo (spatial relationship)  

Q1:  
Thinking process: The text "SEARCH FOR A STAR" is a core identity element of the original image. It is the primary name of one of the featured programs and serves as a key identifier. Even though the instruction allows transformation into a golden statuette, the actual text content must remain unchanged to preserve the identity of the program. If the text were altered or omitted, the reference would be lost. Therefore, this is a core recognition feature with a weight of 3 points.  
Question: Is the text "SEARCH FOR A STAR" present in the edited image?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The text "RISING STAR" is another core identity element, directly tied to the second program. Its presence is essential for maintaining the identity of the event. While the visual form may change, the exact wording must remain to ensure correct identification. Loss of this text would result in misidentification of the program. Thus, it is a core recognition feature with a weight of 3 points.  
Question: Is the text "RISING STAR" present in the edited image?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The "SUMO DIGITAL" branding is a functional element indicating the company behind the event. It is part of the original composition and must be preserved in content, even if its form changes to an embossed seal. Removing or altering the text would break the brand association. This is a core identity element for the organization involved, hence a weight of 3 points.  
Question: Is the text "SUMO DIGITAL" present in the edited image?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The phrase "Character Art Directory 2018" is the main title of the publication and is central to the image's purpose. It identifies the document type and year. The instruction specifies changing its style but not its content. Therefore, the exact text must remain to preserve the document's identity. This is a core recognition feature with a weight of 3 points.  
Question: Is the text "Character Art Directory 2018" present in the edited image?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The central horizontal alignment of the "Character Art Directory 2018" text is a key compositional element that maintains visual balance and hierarchy. The instruction does not mention changing the alignment, and preserving this ensures the layout remains coherent. While not a core identity feature, it is a critical scene element affecting overall consistency. Therefore, it is assigned a weight of 2 points.  
Question: Is the text "Character Art Directory 2018" horizontally centered in the image?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The relative vertical positioning of the logos above the directory title establishes the visual hierarchy. The instruction uses the original image as a structural guide, implying that the top-to-bottom order must be preserved. Changing this would disrupt the intended layout and logical flow. This is an important scene element, thus a weight of 2 points.  
Question: Are the "Search for a Star" and "Rising Star" logos positioned above the "Character Art Directory 2018" text?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The spatial relationship between the "Sumo Digital" logo and the "Rising Star" logo is functionally significant—it indicates brand ownership. The instruction specifies placing the Sumo Digital logo beneath the Rising Star logo, even in its new form. This relative placement must be preserved to maintain logical association. This is an important functional element, hence a weight of 2 points.  
Question: Is the "Sumo Digital" logo positioned beneath the "Rising Star" logo in the edited image?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
