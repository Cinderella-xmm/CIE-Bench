      "thinking_process": "The \"Canon\" logo is the primary brand identifier and essential for recognizing the character as \"Canon the Explorer.\" It is centrally located on the top of the camera and appears in white sans-serif font on a black background. If removed or altered beyond recognition, the character loses its core identity. Therefore, preserving this logo is critical and warrants the highest weight.",
      "question": "Is the \"Canon\" logo present in white text on the top of the camera body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The \"SX 60 HS\" model designation is a unique identifier for this specific camera model. It appears in silver text on the lower right of the camera body and distinguishes it from other models in the lineup. Even in a cartoon form, retaining this label ensures accurate representation of the product being personified. Losing it would make the character ambiguous.",
      "question": "Is the \"SX 60 HS\" text visible in silver lettering on the lower right side of the camera body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The lens barrel contains two lines of technical text: \"CANON ZOOM LENS 65x IS\" and \"3.8-247.0mm 1:3.4-6.5 USM\". These are defining features of the camera’s optical capabilities and are integral to its identity. While the lens may become an eye, the surrounding text should remain legible to preserve authenticity. Altering or removing this text would undermine the connection to the real product.",
      "question": "Are the inscriptions \"CANON ZOOM LENS 65x IS\" and \"3.8-247.0mm 1:3.4-6.5 USM\" visible around the lens barrel?",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The rubberized grip texture on the left side is a distinctive ergonomic feature that differentiates this camera from others. It provides tactile feedback and is visually identifiable due to its pebbled pattern. Even when stylized, the texture should be recognizable to maintain consistency with the original object.",
      "question": "Is the textured grip area on the left side of the camera body clearly visible with a pebbled or dimpled surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The mode dial on the top left is a functional control element and a key design feature of the camera. Its position and circular shape are consistent across the PowerShot series. While it may be exaggerated or turned into a brow, its location and basic form should be preserved to maintain logical coherence with the original device.",
      "question": "Is the mode dial located on the top left of the camera body, near the grip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The flash unit is a small, circular component located directly above the lens. It is a standard feature of this camera model and contributes to its overall silhouette. Although it might be incorporated into the character’s expression (e.g., as a nose or eyebrow), its position and general shape should be retained to avoid misrepresentation.",
      "question": "Is there a small circular flash unit positioned above the lens on the top center of the camera?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The camera body is predominantly black with silver accents. This color scheme is a signature design choice for this model. While the cartoon version may use brighter colors, the base color should remain black to preserve the original identity. Any significant deviation would make it unrecognizable as the original camera.",
      "question": "Is the main body of the camera black in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
