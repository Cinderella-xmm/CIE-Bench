      "thinking_process": "The three large arched windows are the most prominent architectural feature of the building and serve as a key identifier of its design. Their shape, number, and symmetrical arrangement are essential for recognizing the building as the Marina Theater. If these are altered in shape or count, the structure loses its defining character. Thus, preserving their presence and configuration is critical for identity retention.",
      "question": "Are the three large arched windows on the upper level of the building present and arranged symmetrically?",

      "thinking_process": "The central vertical black sign is a unique and highly visible element at the apex of the building. It contributes to the building's silhouette and serves as a landmark feature. Its removal or replacement would fundamentally alter the building's profile and diminish its recognizability.",
      "question": "Is the tall vertical black sign positioned at the center top of the building?",

      "thinking_process": "The decorative cornice with spire-like finials along the roofline is a distinctive architectural detail that adds to the building’s historical and stylistic identity. This ornamentation is part of the building’s cultural and visual signature and must be preserved in form and position to maintain authenticity.",
      "question": "Does the building retain the decorative cornice with spire-like finials along the roofline?",

      "thinking_process": "The Walgreens and Marina Theater signs are functional and symbolic elements that define the commercial use of the building. Their positions—left and right respectively—and their red script lettering are crucial for identifying the establishments. Changing their location or removing them would misrepresent the scene.",
      "question": "Are the Walgreens and Marina Theater signs located on the left and right sides of the ground floor respectively, with red script lettering?",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The two vintage cars are placed in specific positions relative to the storefronts: one in front of Walgreens, the other in front of the Marina Theater. This spatial relationship reflects real-world usage and enhances the scene’s coherence. Altering their positions would break the logical connection between vehicles and businesses.",
      "question": "Are the two vintage cars positioned in front of the Walgreens and Marina Theater entrances respectively?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The presence of people near the entrances adds life and scale to the scene. Their existence indicates activity and helps establish the building as an active public space. While their appearance may change in a LEGO version, their location near the doors must be preserved for narrative consistency.",
      "question": "Are there people visible near the entrances of the Walgreens and Marina Theater?",

      "thinking_process": "The sidewalk and curb line provide context for the street-level environment and support the realism of the scene. Their presence ensures the viewer understands the spatial relationship between the building and the road. Removing them would make the scene feel incomplete or floating.",
      "question": "Is there a sidewalk and curb line in front of the building?",
