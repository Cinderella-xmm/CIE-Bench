      "thinking_process": "The stepped ziggurat-like central tower is the most iconic architectural feature of the fortress. Its layered, pyramidal shape is a core identifier; if this structure is flattened or replaced with a different form, the fortress would lose its defining identity. This is a key visual element required for recognition, making it a 3-point question.",
      "question": "Is the central tower of the fortress composed of multiple stacked, progressively smaller rectangular tiers forming a stepped pyramid shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The crenellated battlements along the top of the fortress walls are a functional and visual hallmark of medieval fortifications. Their presence defines the defensive nature of the structure. Even in a cookie version, these should remain to preserve architectural authenticity. Removing them would make the structure appear incomplete or non-fortified, affecting identification.",
      "question": "Are there regular, alternating tooth-like projections (crenellations) along the upper edges of the fortress walls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The large arched gateway at the base of the fortress is a key entry point and structural feature. It anchors the design and provides logical access. Its position and shape are essential to the fortress's function and appearance. Losing this arch would distort the building’s symmetry and purpose.",
      "question": "Is there a prominent arched opening located at the lower front section of the fortress, serving as a main entrance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The waterfall directly beneath the fortress wall is a critical environmental and compositional element. It establishes the interaction between the fortress and the river, reinforcing the sense of height and natural defense. Even if made of icing, its location and flow direction must match the original to maintain spatial logic.",
      "question": "Does the waterfall originate from a gap in the cliff face directly beneath the fortress wall and cascade downward into the river below?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The fortress is positioned on a high cliff above a river gorge, creating a dramatic elevation contrast. This spatial relationship is fundamental to the scene’s grandeur and strategic positioning. Although the background may change to a platter, the relative placement of the fortress above the river must remain unchanged to preserve the original composition.",
      "question": "Is the fortress situated on a raised cliff overlooking a river that flows through a narrow canyon below?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The presence of dense green vegetation along the canyon walls and near the riverbank adds ecological context and visual contrast. While trees may be replaced with marzipan, their **placement** and **distribution** around the gorge should be preserved to maintain environmental realism. This is a secondary detail but contributes to scene coherence.",
      "question": "Are clusters of green shrubs and trees visible along the canyon walls and riverbanks surrounding the fortress?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The fortress has a distinct rectangular base with vertical walls and corner towers. This geometric foundation supports the upper structures and is necessary for structural consistency. Even in cookie form, the basic rectangular footprint must remain to ensure the structure is recognizable.",
      "question": "Does the fortress have a solid rectangular base with vertical walls and corner towers supporting the upper levels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
