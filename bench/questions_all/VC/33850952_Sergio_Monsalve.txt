**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a modern high-rise building with a highly sculptural, undulating facade composed of smooth, flowing metallic panels. The structure features continuous, wave-like horizontal curves that wrap around the building’s exterior, creating dynamic shadows and light reflections. Each floor has large, irregularly shaped glass windows embedded into the curved surface, many of which are framed by transparent glass railings forming private balconies. The windows vary in shape—some are oval or kidney-shaped—aligned along the organic contours of the facade. The material appears to be brushed stainless steel or a similar reflective metal, exhibiting subtle gradients from dark gray to light silver depending on sunlight exposure. The overall form is fluid and biomorphic, resembling natural growth patterns. The architectural style is futuristic and parametric, with no sharp edges or rectilinear geometry. The lighting suggests daytime, with strong directional sunlight casting defined shadows across the curved surfaces.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction explicitly transforms the building facade into an **organic, alien-like structure** on a strange planet. This includes:  
- Turning the **curves into tentacle appendages** → indicates a radical transformation of form; thus, the original curvilinear shape can be altered in purpose and interpretation.  
- Adding **fibrous textures across sections** → implies new surface detail, so existing texture (smooth metal) is replaceable.  
- Replacing **window surfaces with translucent, membrane-like panels** → allows full replacement of window materials and transparency properties.  
- Detailing the **metal with iridescent, scale-like patterning** → means the original metallic finish is to be replaced.  
- Incorporating **bio-luminescent lines along edges emitting eerie glow** → introduces new luminous elements not present originally.

These instructions clearly allow for:
- Transformation of **form** (from architectural curves to biological tentacles)
- Replacement of **material textures** (smooth metal → fibrous, scaly, iridescent)
- Replacement of **window type** (glass → translucent membranes)
- Addition of **new lighting effects** (glowing bio-luminescent lines)

Thus, all **structural form**, **surface material**, **window composition**, and **lighting characteristics** are permitted to change.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
- The shape of the facade curves (can become tentacle-like)  
- Surface texture of the metallic panels (can be replaced with fibrous, scaly, iridescent patterns)  
- Window materials and appearance (can be replaced with translucent membrane-like surfaces)  
- Lighting effects (can add glowing bio-luminescent lines)  
- Overall context/environment (can shift to an alien planet setting)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
Despite the extensive modifications allowed, certain **core visual elements** must remain intact to preserve the identity and coherence of the original image as a reference point. These include:

1. **Core recognition elements**:  
   - The **presence of multiple floors** arranged vertically — this is fundamental to identifying the object as a multi-story building. Even if transformed into tentacles, the vertical stacking of levels should logically persist in some form to maintain structural logic.  
   - The **overall orientation and perspective** of the building (side view, upward angle) — this defines how we perceive depth and scale. Changing this would alter the viewer’s spatial understanding.  
   - The **position and alignment of balcony railings** — while their material may change, their placement relative to windows and floors is a key architectural feature. Their absence would remove critical spatial cues.

2. **Functional/logical association elements**:  
   - The **relationship between windows and balconies** — each balcony corresponds to a windowed unit. This functional pairing must remain consistent even if both are stylized, otherwise the building loses architectural logic.  
   - The **repetition of floor units** — the rhythmic pattern of windows and balconies across stories is a defining trait of the design. Disrupting this rhythm without reason undermines structural integrity.

3. **Non-modified element deduction**:  
   After excluding allowed changes (e.g., texture, material, lighting), what remains?  
   - The **number of visible floors** (at least 8–10 distinct levels)  
   - The **spatial arrangement of windows per floor** — each level has a cluster of windows grouped in a specific arc  
   - The **existence of glass railings** — though they may become membranous, their function as barrier elements must be preserved  
   - The **presence of indoor furnishings** (e.g., chairs, tables visible through glass) — these indicate habitation and human scale, which should remain evident even if stylized

Therefore, despite the fantastical transformation, **the structural hierarchy, spatial layout, and functional relationships** between components must be preserved.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
- The vertical stacking of at least eight distinct floor levels  
- The presence of glass railings on each balcony, positioned adjacent to windows  
- The repeating pattern of windows per floor, aligned along curved arcs  
- The existence of interior furnishings visible through windows (e.g., chairs, plants)  
- The side-on perspective showing the building's height and curvature  
- The relationship between each window and its corresponding balcony

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

Q1:  
Thinking process: The vertical stacking of floor levels is a core architectural feature that defines the building as a high-rise structure. Removing or altering this would fundamentally change the subject from a skyscraper to something unrecognizable. Even if transformed into tentacles, the hierarchical layering must remain to preserve logical continuity. Thus, this is a 3-point question as it directly affects identity recognition.  
Question: Are there at least eight distinct horizontal levels stacked vertically along the building facade?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The glass railings on each balcony are a defining functional element that separates living space from exterior. Their presence is essential for maintaining the architectural logic of private outdoor spaces. Even if replaced with membrane-like structures, their location and role must be retained. This is a 2-point element because it supports scene coherence and functional plausibility.  
Question: Is there a transparent railing structure visible on each balcony, positioned directly outside the windows?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The repeating pattern of windows per floor, following the curved contour, is a signature design trait of this building. Altering this rhythm would break the visual identity. While the windows themselves may be replaced, their clustered, arced arrangement must remain to preserve the original aesthetic. This is a 2-point element due to its importance in design recognition.  
Question: Are the windows on each floor arranged in a continuous, curved arc along the building’s surface?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q4:  
Thinking process: Interior furnishings such as chairs and potted plants visible through windows confirm human occupancy and scale. Their presence grounds the building in reality and provides contextual clues. Even if stylized, they must remain visible to maintain narrative consistency. This is a 1-point detail but necessary for coherence.  
Question: Can furniture items (such as chairs or tables) be seen inside the rooms through the windows?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The side-on perspective with upward tilt is crucial for conveying the building’s height and curvature. Changing the viewpoint would disrupt spatial understanding and make the edit inconsistent with the original framing. This is a 2-point element because it defines the viewer’s relationship to the structure.  
Question: Is the building viewed from a low-angle side perspective, showing its height and curving profile?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The relationship between each window and its adjacent balcony is a functional architectural pairing. This one-to-one correspondence must be preserved to maintain logical consistency. Even if both are transformed, their adjacency must remain. This is a 2-point element due to its structural significance.  
Question: Does each window have a corresponding balcony immediately outside it, aligned horizontally?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2
