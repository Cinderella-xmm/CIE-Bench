Description of reference image: The subject is a grand concert hall featuring a central black grand piano positioned on a polished wooden stage, facing an audience seated in tiered rows across multiple levels. The hall has a circular, opulent architectural design with rich golden ornamentation along the balconies and walls. A large, elaborate chandelier hangs from the center of the domed ceiling, which features a painted fresco with floral and classical motifs surrounded by gilded borders. The audience consists of numerous individuals dressed formally, seated in red upholstered chairs, filling the entire auditorium. The lighting is warm and dramatic, highlighting the golden tones of the interior and casting soft reflections on the piano’s glossy surface. The perspective centers on the piano, drawing attention to its open lid and keyboard, while the audience forms a symmetrical arc around it.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions to determine what can be changed. The instruction specifies transforming the scene into a vintage-style theater program cover, which implies changes to overall style, color palette, and composition. Specifically:
- "Enhance the chandelier with ornate detailing" → allows modification of chandelier’s visual complexity.
- "Add intricate patterns to the ceiling" → permits alteration of ceiling texture and design.
- "Simplify the audience into silhouette figures" → explicitly allows changing audience appearance.
- "Instill a sepia-toned color palette" → permits global color shift.
- "Frame the grand piano as the central motif" → confirms piano remains central but may be emphasized stylistically.
- "Place 'AN EVENING OF CLASSICAL MAJESTY' in elegant serif typography at the top" → adds new text element, not present originally.

Thus, the following elements are allowed to change:
- Chandelier details (ornamentation)
- Ceiling patterns (additional intricacy)
- Audience representation (simplified to silhouettes)
- Color scheme (shift to sepia tone)
- Text overlay (new typographic addition)

Allowed Changes List:
- Chandelier’s level of detail
- Ceiling decorative patterns
- Audience figures (from full-color individuals to silhouettes)
- Overall color palette (to sepia tone)
- Addition of textual title at top

Step 2 – Determine the elements that should remain unchanged  
Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements: The grand piano is the central object and functional centerpiece of the scene. Its presence, form, and position are essential for identifying the scene as a classical music performance setting. While the piano's styling may be enhanced, its fundamental shape—especially the open lid, curved body, and visible keyboard—must remain recognizable. The stage floor’s reflective wooden surface also contributes to the authenticity of the concert environment and supports the piano’s placement.

Functional/logical association elements: The piano must remain on the stage, centrally located, and oriented toward the audience. This spatial relationship is critical to the logic of a concert performance. Changing this would disrupt the narrative function of the image. Additionally, the stage’s polished wooden floor must retain its reflective quality and directional alignment to maintain spatial coherence.

Non-modified element deduction: After excluding the allowed changes, the following elements must be retained based on their visual uniqueness and role in defining the original scene:
- The piano’s structural form (curved side, open lid, legs, keyboard)
- The stage’s polished wooden surface with reflection
- The dome-shaped ceiling with its central fresco and surrounding gold trim
- The general layout of the auditorium (tiered seating, balconies, symmetry)
- The chandelier’s basic structure and position (though details may be enhanced)

Preservation Targets List:  
- The black grand piano with open lid and visible keyboard  
- The polished wooden stage floor with reflective surface  
- The central dome ceiling with painted fresco and gilded border  
- The symmetrical arrangement of tiered audience seating  
- The chandelier’s central hanging position and basic crystal structure

    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The black grand piano is the core subject of the image and its distinctive shape—especially the curved side, open lid, and visible keyboard—is essential for identifying it as a concert piano. Any significant alteration to these features would render it unrecognizable as such. Therefore, preserving the piano’s form is critical for maintaining the image’s identity and purpose.
    Question: Is the black grand piano with an open lid and visible keyboard present in the center of the stage?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The polished wooden stage floor with its reflective surface is a key environmental feature that grounds the piano and enhances the sense of realism and luxury. It defines the space and reflects light and objects, contributing to the overall atmosphere. Losing this detail would disrupt the visual coherence of the scene.
    Question: Is the stage floor made of polished wood with visible reflections of the piano and ambient light?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The central dome ceiling with its painted fresco and surrounding gilded border is a signature architectural element of the concert hall. It provides the backdrop and defines the opulence of the venue. Even if additional patterns are added, the original fresco and its placement must remain intact to preserve the hall’s identity.
    Question: Is the central dome ceiling featuring a painted fresco with floral motifs and a surrounding gilded border still present?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The chandelier’s central position and basic structure—its multi-tiered crystal form and candle-like lights—are iconic elements that define the hall’s grandeur. While the instruction allows enhancement of ornate detailing, the chandelier’s fundamental shape and location must remain unchanged to maintain continuity with the original scene.
    Question: Is the large chandelier suspended from the center of the ceiling, composed of multiple tiers of crystals and candle-like lights?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The symmetrical arrangement of tiered audience seating is a defining spatial feature of the concert hall. It establishes the scale and context of the performance. Although the audience may be simplified into silhouettes, their layered, curved configuration around the stage must be preserved to maintain the architectural logic and visual balance.
    Question: Are the audience seats arranged in multiple curved tiers surrounding the stage in a symmetrical fashion?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
