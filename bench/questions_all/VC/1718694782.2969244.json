      "thinking_process": "The character’s reddish-brown hair is a core identity feature. Its color and styling (slightly tousled, swept back) distinguish him from other characters. If changed in hue or form, the character becomes unrecognizable. This is a key visual identifier, hence weighted 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the character's hair reddish-brown in color and styled with visible curls and a swept-back motion?",

      "thinking_process": "The beige pants are part of the character’s consistent outfit. Their color and slight creasing at the knees are noticeable details that contribute to realism and identity. Changing them would disrupt visual continuity. While not as iconic as the hoodie, they are important enough to retain for coherence, hence weighted 2 points.",
      "question": "Are the character's pants light beige or khaki in color with visible creases at the knee area?",

      "thinking_process": "The hiking boots are functional and stylistic elements. Their dark brown color, thick soles, and tied laces are specific details that ground the character in a realistic outdoor context. Altering them would affect believability and identity.

      "thinking_process": "The facial expression—specifically the wide eyes, open mouth showing teeth, and joyful demeanor—is crucial to conveying emotion and character personality.

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The distant mountain with a sharp peak is a key environmental landmark. Its shape and position establish the setting. Even if the sky is enhanced, the mountain silhouette must remain to preserve spatial context. This is a critical background element, thus weighted 2 points.",
      "question": "Is there a prominent sharp-peaked mountain visible in the background?",

      "thinking_process": "The rocky cliff edge with yellow wildflowers is a unique environmental detail. It adds specificity to the location and enhances visual storytelling.

      "question": "Is the cliff edge covered with patches of yellow wildflowers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The presence of clouds in the sky is part of the atmospheric composition. Although their color and animation may be enhanced, their existence is essential for maintaining the original sky’s mood. Removing them would fundamentally alter the scene. This is a key environmental component, thus weighted 2 points.",
      "question": "Are there clouds visible in the sky above the mountains?",
