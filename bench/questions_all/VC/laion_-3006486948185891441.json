      "thinking_process": "The raised left front leg is a defining posture of Tang dynasty prancing horse sculptures, distinguishing them from static or walking poses. It is a core identity feature; if removed or altered, the sculpture would no longer represent the intended dynamic motion typical of this style. Thus, preserving this specific limb position is critical for authenticity.",
      "question": "Is the left front leg of the horse raised off the ground?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The flowing mane is a signature stylistic element of Tang horse sculptures, often rendered with long, vertical striations to suggest movement. Its presence and direction are key to recognizing the sculpture as authentic. Removing or simplifying it would destroy the visual character of the piece.",
      "question": "Does the mane flow downward along the neck in long, wavy strands?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The tail draping over the rear flank is a distinctive compositional choice in Tang horse statuary, contributing to balance and elegance. Its position is integral to the sculpture’s aesthetic and historical accuracy. Altering its placement would disrupt the intended form.",
      "question": "Is the tail positioned over the left side of the rear flank?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The saddle cloth with its pleated folds and spherical decorations is a historically significant accessory. These elements are not merely decorative but reflect Tang military and court attire. Their presence and arrangement are crucial for identifying the sculpture as a high-status horse representation.",
      "question": "Are there pleated folds and spherical ornaments on the saddle cloth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The red-orange pigment traces on the saddle, bridle, and limbs indicate original polychromy, a key feature of Tang terracotta figures. These remnants are evidence of the artwork’s historical finish and must be preserved to maintain authenticity.",
      "question": "Are there visible traces of red-orange pigment on the saddle and bridle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The facial features—especially the large eyes, flared nostrils, and upright ears—are characteristic of Tang horse iconography. They contribute to the animal’s expressive quality and must be preserved to retain the sculpture’s identity.",
      "question": "Do the horse’s ears stand upright and pointed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The hoof positions define the stability and motion of the sculpture. With three hooves touching the base and one raised, the stance is balanced and dynamic. Changing any hoof position would affect the perceived movement and structural integrity.",
      "question": "Are three hooves in contact with the base and one lifted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "thinking_process": "The texture of the terracotta surface, including chipping and weathering, contributes to the artifact’s aged appearance and historical authenticity. While minor surface variations may be acceptable, the overall roughness and patina should remain intact.",
      "question": "Is the surface of the horse showing signs of chipping and aging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
