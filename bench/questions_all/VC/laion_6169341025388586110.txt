**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a large stone statue of Lord Shiva, depicted in a seated meditative posture (likely padmasana), with multiple arms. The statue is carved from light gray stone, featuring smooth, detailed textures typical of monumental Hindu sculpture. The figure has four visible arms: the right front hand holds a trident (trishul) vertically; the left front hand rests on the knee, palm down; the upper right hand is raised in abhaya mudra (gesture of protection); the upper left hand holds a damaru (small drum). A golden serpent (naga) coils around the neck and shoulders, with its head raised near the right shoulder and another snake emerging from beneath the arm near the waist. The statue wears a beaded mala around the neck, golden bangles on each wrist, and a crescent moon adorns the hair. The third eye is clearly marked on the forehead. The background features a soft gradient sky at dusk or dawn, with a faint crescent moon visible in the upper left corner. The base of the statue includes ornate architectural elements resembling temple motifs.

**Thinking process:**  
First, analyze the editing instructions word by word to determine what can be changed:

- "Transform the statue into a **3D clay model**" → The material and form of the statue are to be changed from stone to clay.
- "Encased in a **large circular glass dome** resting on a decorative pedestal" → The environment and containment structure are to be altered significantly.
- "Add ornate patterns to the glass featuring motifs like lotuses and waves" → The glass surface is to be decorated; this affects the new scene but not original content.
- "Inside, spotlight highlights the trident, snake, and drum" → Lighting effects are added, emphasizing specific objects.
- "Accentuate the muscular contours with intricate shadowing" → Visual enhancement of muscle definition through shading; implies stylization but does not remove original anatomy.
- "Place small incense holders around the base for aromatic ambiance" → Adds new environmental elements.

Key insight: While the **form**, **material**, **container**, and **lighting** are being modified, the **core identity of the deity and symbolic attributes** are referenced as objects to be highlighted (trident, snake, drum), suggesting they must remain identifiable.

Thus, the allowed changes include:
- Material transformation (stone → clay)
- Environmental enclosure (open air → glass dome)
- Background (sky → interior of dome)
- Lighting (natural daylight → spotlight)
- Addition of new elements (glass dome, incense holders, decorative patterns)
- Stylistic enhancements (shadowing, color accentuation)

**Allowed Changes List:**
- The physical material of the statue (stone → clay)
- The surrounding environment (open sky → enclosed glass dome)
- The presence of a decorative pedestal and glass dome
- Ornamental patterns on the glass (lotus/wave motifs)
- Spotlight lighting effects
- Incense holders placed around the base
- Enhanced shadowing on muscles
- Color emphasis on golden elements (snake, jewelry)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
Now apply exclusion based on the above allowed changes to identify what **must remain unchanged**.

**Core recognition elements:**  
Lord Shiva is identified by specific iconography that cannot be altered without losing religious and cultural identity:
- The **trident (trishul)** is a defining attribute of Shiva — its shape, position, and function (held in right hand) are essential.
- The **damaru (drum)** in the upper left hand is unique to Shiva and symbolizes cosmic rhythm.
- The **serpent (naga)** coiled around the neck and body is a key identifier — especially its golden hue and placement.
- The **third eye** on the forehead is an iconic feature distinguishing Shiva from other deities.
- The **crescent moon** in the hair is a signature element.
- The **mala (beads)** around the neck and **bangles** on wrists are traditional accessories.
- The **posture** (seated, legs crossed, hands in specific mudras) defines the meditative aspect of Shiva.

These elements are not mentioned as changeable in the instructions and are central to identity. Even if the statue becomes clay, these symbols must retain their form and position.

**Functional/logical association elements:**  
- The **trident’s grip** in the right hand must remain functional — it should still appear held properly.
- The **drum’s orientation** in the left hand must allow for logical holding.
- The **snake’s coil path** must follow anatomically plausible routes around the neck and shoulder.
- The **position of the hands** (abhaya mudra, dhyana mudra, etc.) must preserve ritual meaning.

Changing these would break symbolic logic and visual coherence.

**Non-modified element deduction:**  
Even though the material changes, the **shape and configuration** of limbs, facial features, jewelry, and accessories must remain consistent with the original image. For example:
- The **facial expression** (calm, serene, eyes half-closed) must persist.
- The **muscular definition** of torso and arms must remain recognizable.
- The **base architecture** may be replaced, but the **statue’s pose and proportions** must stay intact.

Although the instructions say “accentuate the muscular contours,” this implies enhancement, not redesign — so the original musculature must still be present.

**Preservation Targets List:**
- The trident held in the right hand
- The damaru held in the upper left hand
- The golden serpent coiled around the neck and shoulder
- The third eye on the forehead
- The crescent moon in the hair
- The beaded mala around the neck
- The golden bangles on all wrists
- The abhaya mudra in the upper right hand
- The seated posture with crossed legs
- The facial features (eyes, nose, lips, calm expression)
- The overall anatomical proportions and limb positions

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The trident (trishul) is the most iconic weapon associated with Lord Shiva. Its three-pronged shape and vertical orientation in the right hand are essential for identification. If it were removed or altered in form, the statue would no longer be recognized as Shiva. This is a core identity feature, hence weighted at 3 points.
    Question: Is the trident with three prongs clearly visible and held vertically in the right hand?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
