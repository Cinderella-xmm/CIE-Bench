      "thinking_process": "The two-layered structure is the most fundamental identifier of this chocolate cake. It distinguishes it from single-layer cakes or other types of desserts like cheesecake or mousse. In the edited image, even if the cake is anthropomorphized, the internal composition must reflect this dual-layer design to maintain authenticity. Losing this feature would fundamentally alter the cake’s identity. Therefore, this is a core recognition element with a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Does the cake retain its two distinct layers of dark chocolate sponge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The glossy chocolate glaze is a signature feature of this cake, contributing significantly to its visual appeal and identity. The instruction explicitly requires retaining the \"luscious chocolate glaze,\" making it a core element. The glaze’s sheen and fluidity are essential to its recognition. If replaced with matte frosting or omitted entirely, the cake would lose its defining characteristic. Thus, this is a high-weight retention requirement.",
      "question": "Is the top of the cake covered in a glossy, reflective chocolate glaze?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The drips of glaze are not random; they follow a specific pattern—three prominent streams flowing down the front side of the cake. This detail adds realism and uniqueness to the cake’s appearance. Even in a stylized manga version, these drips should be preserved in form and position to ensure continuity. Their absence would make the cake look different from the original. This is a key identifying detail, hence a weight of 2 points.",
      "question": "Are there three visible streams of chocolate glaze dripping down the front face of the cake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The dark brown color and porous texture of the sponge layers are essential to identifying the cake as a chocolate sponge cake. Lighter or smoother textures would suggest a different type of cake. The instruction emphasizes preserving the \"layered design,\" which includes both structure and material appearance. This texture is a secondary but important identifier, so it carries a weight of 2 points.",
      "question": "Do the cake layers exhibit a dark brown, moist, and porous sponge texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The cake is presented on a white circular plate, which is a consistent element in the original image. The instruction mentions \"elegant presentation on the plate,\" implying that the plate must remain part of the composition. While the plate may be stylized in the manga version, its basic shape and color should be preserved to maintain the original context. This is a contextual detail that supports the cake’s identity, so it is assigned a weight of 1 point.",
      "question": "Is the cake placed on a white circular plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The triangular shape of the cake slice is a direct result of how it was cut from a round cake. This geometric form is a defining visual trait that helps identify it as a slice rather than a whole cake or another shape. Even when anthropomorphized, the base silhouette should retain this angular form to preserve recognition. This is a structural detail that contributes to identity, so it is given a weight of 2 points.",
      "question": "Does the cake maintain its triangular cross-sectional shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
