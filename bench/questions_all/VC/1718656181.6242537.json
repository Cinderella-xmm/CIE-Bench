Its presence and structure (a vertical stem with a rounded, billowing cap) are essential for identifying the event. Even in pop art form, this silhouette must be preserved to maintain the core identity of the explosion. Loss of this shape would make the image unrecognizable as a nuclear blast, undermining the entire reference. Thus, this is a 3-point element.",

While it may be simplified into abstract shapes, its existence as a landmass must be retained to preserve the logical setting of the event. Removing or replacing it entirely would break the spatial context. Therefore, the presence of a landmass beneath the explosion is critical and must be retained.",
