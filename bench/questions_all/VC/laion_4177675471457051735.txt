Description of reference image: The subject is a woman with dark brown hair styled in a sleek, pulled-back manner, adorned with a black beaded mesh veil that covers her forehead and extends down to frame her face. She wears large, ornate dangling earrings composed of dark gemstones and intricate metalwork. Her lips are painted in a deep burgundy shade, and her skin tone is warm and radiant. She is wearing a black sheer gown with vertical beaded stripes and a plunging neckline detailed with rows of dark triangular spikes and beadwork along the edges. The background is softly blurred, showing indistinct figures and warm ambient lighting, suggesting an indoor event or red carpet setting. A man in formal attire is partially visible behind her, slightly out of focus.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions that clearly state what can be changed:  
- "Transform the image into a Renaissance portrait on canvas" → indicates a complete stylistic transformation; the overall composition, medium, and aesthetic must shift toward classical European art.  
- "Converting the figure into an elegantly dressed noble" → allows for change in clothing style, social role, and possibly posture.  
- "Recreate the black attire in deep velvet" → explicitly changes material and texture of clothing.  
- "The jewelry as pearl adornments" → replaces existing gemstone earrings with pearls.  
- "Background as a classic interior with heavy tapestries" → fully replaces current background.  
- "Using warm earth tones and intricate detailing for authenticity" → permits color palette and detail style changes.

Allowed Changes List:  
- Hairstyle (can be reimagined as elaborate Renaissance coiffure)  
- Clothing (material, design, and silhouette can be transformed into noble attire)  
- Jewelry (gemstone earrings replaced with pearls)  
- Background (current blurred event scene replaced with classical interior)  
- Color scheme (shift from modern contrast to warm earth tones)  
- Medium (from photograph to oil-on-canvas painting)  
- Pose and expression (may be adjusted for nobility portrayal)

Step 2 - Determine the elements that should remain unchanged

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements: The original subject is identifiable by specific facial features and accessories. While the hairstyle, clothing, and background are permitted to change, certain visual identifiers must remain to preserve identity. These include:
- Facial structure: The shape of the nose, jawline, and eye placement are unique and essential for recognition.
- Skin tone and texture: Warm, even-toned complexion is a defining feature.
- Lip color and shape: Deep burgundy lipstick with defined lip line is distinctive.
- Earring shape and structure: Though material may change, the form and dangle style must be preserved if not explicitly altered.
- Veil pattern: The black beaded mesh netting over the face is iconic and visually striking—its presence and grid-like structure are key to identity.

Functional/logical association elements: None directly tied to function, but logical consistency requires preservation of the subject’s identity through facial features. The veil and earrings serve as signature accessories; their structural form should remain even if materials change.

Non-modified element deduction: After excluding allowed changes (clothing, background, jewelry material), remaining elements include:
- Facial features (eyes, nose, mouth)
- Skin tone
- Veil's mesh pattern and coverage area
- Earring silhouette and attachment point
- Gown’s neckline structure (plunging V-shape with spiked trim)

Preservation Targets List:  
- Facial structure (eye position, nose shape, jawline)  
- Skin tone and texture  
- Deep burgundy lip color  
- Black beaded mesh veil with grid pattern covering forehead and upper face  
- Dangling earring shape and attachment to earlobe  
- Plunging V-neckline with spiked trim on gown

    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The deep burgundy lip color is a highly distinctive feature of the subject in the original image. It is a core identifier used in public recognition and media representation. Changing this would significantly alter the subject’s recognizable appearance, especially when paired with other features like the veil and earrings. This makes it a high-weight visual anchor.
    Question: Is the deep burgundy lip color present on the subject's lips?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The black beaded mesh veil is a signature accessory that defines the subject’s look in this image. Its grid pattern and coverage across the forehead and cheeks are unique and immediately recognizable. Even if transformed into a Renaissance-style headdress, the underlying geometric structure and placement must be retained to maintain visual continuity.
    Question: Is the black beaded mesh veil covering the forehead and extending over the eyes present?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The shape and dangle style of the earrings are critical to identifying the subject’s fashion choice in this moment. Although the instruction allows changing them to pearls, the silhouette and how they hang from the earlobe must remain consistent to preserve the original visual rhythm and balance of the face.
    Question: Are large, dangling earrings attached to the earlobes, featuring a multi-tiered, ornate structure?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The facial structure—specifically the eye placement, nose bridge, and jawline—is essential for identity retention. These features are immutable under artistic reinterpretation unless the subject is completely replaced. Any deviation would compromise recognition.
    Question: Are the eyes positioned symmetrically, with a prominent nose and defined jawline visible?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The plunging V-neckline with spiked trim is a distinctive garment detail that contributes to the overall aesthetic and identity of the outfit. While the fabric may change to velvet and the style may become more noble, the structural outline of the neckline and the arrangement of spikes must be preserved to maintain coherence with the original.
    Question: Does the gown feature a deep V-neckline with triangular spike embellishments along the edge?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2

{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The subject’s skin tone is a core biometric identifier. While lighting and tone may shift in a Renaissance rendering, the natural warmth and evenness of the skin must be preserved to ensure accurate representation of the individual.
    Question: Is the subject’s skin tone warm and evenly toned without visible discoloration?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
