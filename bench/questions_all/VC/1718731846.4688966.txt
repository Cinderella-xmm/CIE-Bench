Description of reference image: The subject is a stylized, cartoonish figurine of a small dog resembling a French Bulldog or similar breed, sitting upright on all fours. It has large, expressive eyes with prominent black pupils and subtle reflections, giving it a lifelike gaze. The face is split vertically down the center into two distinct color zones: the left half is black fur with a smooth texture, while the right half is white fur with soft, slightly textured rendering. The ears are pointed and erect, with pink inner ear linings and dark outer edges. The muzzle is predominantly white with a small black nose and defined whisker lines. The body is primarily white, with soft, rounded contours suggesting plushness and volume. A silver collar is worn around its neck, featuring a circular tag with a visible eye-like symbol and a smaller spherical charm. The background is a neutral gradient from light gray to pale blue, softly lit to emphasize the figure without casting harsh shadows. The overall aesthetic is clean, polished, and digitally rendered with high detail in textures and lighting.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions that clearly state what can be changed:  
- "Transform the small dog figurine into a polished wood carving" → This implies the **material** and **texture** of the subject must change from plastic/plush-like to wood.  
- "Maintain its black-and-white color pattern through contrasting wood tones" → Color pattern (black/white split) is preserved but via **wood tone contrast**, not pigment. So the **color division** remains, but **material origin** changes.  
- "Use smooth, rounded contours for realism" → Contours may be refined but remain **smooth and rounded**, so shape integrity is maintained.  
- "Accentuate facial features with fine carved lines" → Facial details like eyes, nose, and mouth will now have **carved line emphasis**, implying added texture but not altering their positions or forms.  
- "Position it on a minimalist wooden platform" → Background/environment changes; original neutral gradient background is replaced by a **wooden platform**, meaning scene elements are altered.

Thus, allowed changes include:
- Material transformation: from digital plush-like surface to **polished wood**
- Texture: from soft fur-like to **carved wood grain**
- Surface finish: from matte/soft to **glossy/polished**
- Collar and tags: likely to become **wooden or carved versions** unless specified otherwise
- Background: from gradient to **minimalist wooden platform**

Allowed Changes List:
(Surface material of the dog figurine)
(Texture of fur and skin surfaces)
(Color representation method — using wood tones instead of pigments)
(Background environment — replacement with wooden platform)
(Collar and tag materials — if implied to match wood carving style)
(Facial detailing method — use of carved lines)

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements:  
The dog's **distinctive black-and-white facial split** is central to its identity. Even though the color will be simulated via wood tones, the **vertical division** must remain intact. The **large, round eyes** with reflective highlights are key to its expressive character. The **upright sitting posture**, **pointed ears**, and **white muzzle with black nose** are essential anatomical identifiers. These features define the subject as a specific stylized puppy, and changing them would alter its core identity.

Functional/logical association elements:  
The **collar and tags** serve a functional role (identification), and although they may be reinterpreted in wood, their **presence and position** should remain consistent. If removed or relocated, it breaks the logical continuity of the figurine being a pet with accessories.

Non-modified element deduction:  
After excluding allowed changes (material, texture, background), the remaining visual elements must be preserved:  
- **Facial symmetry and split pattern**  
- **Eye shape and placement**  
- **Ear structure and positioning**  
- **Muzzle shape and nose location**  
- **Body posture and limb arrangement**  
- **Collar and tag presence and relative position**

These are not explicitly allowed to change and are critical for maintaining the figurine’s identity and coherence.

Preservation Targets List:  
(The vertical black-and-white facial split pattern)  
(The large round eyes with reflective highlights)  
(The upright sitting posture with front paws forward)  
(The pointed ears with pink inner lining and dark outer edge)  
(The white muzzle with black nose and defined whiskers)  
(The presence and position of the collar with attached tags)

    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The vertical split between black and white fur on the face is the most iconic feature of this figurine, defining its unique appearance. It is the primary identifier that distinguishes it from other dog representations. Even if rendered in wood tones, the **division line must remain exactly vertical and bisecting the face**, preserving the symmetry and duality. Losing this would fundamentally alter the subject’s identity.
    Question: Is the vertical facial split between black and white fur still present, dividing the face precisely down the center?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3

{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The large, round eyes with glossy reflections are essential to the figurine’s expressive and cartoonish character. They are positioned symmetrically and dominate the facial area. Their **shape, size, and reflective quality** are core to recognition. Any distortion or simplification would diminish the emotional impact and visual identity.
    Question: Are both eyes large, round, and positioned symmetrically on either side of the facial split, with visible highlights reflecting light?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The upright sitting posture with front paws placed forward is a key pose that defines the figurine’s stance and balance. It contributes to the sense of alertness and cuteness. Changing the posture (e.g., lying down or crouching) would disrupt the intended presentation and make it unrecognizable as the same subject.
    Question: Is the dog in an upright sitting position with both front paws flat on the ground and hind legs tucked beneath the body?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The ears are sharply pointed and erect, with a clear pink inner lining and dark outer edge. Their **shape and orientation** are distinctive. While the material may change to wood, the **ear structure must remain unchanged** to preserve the breed-like appearance and overall design.
    Question: Are both ears pointed upward, erect, and symmetrical, with visible pink inner surfaces and dark outer edges?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The white muzzle with a black nose and subtle whisker lines is a defining facial feature. The **nose is centrally located**, and the **whisker lines extend outward** from the snout. These details contribute to the realistic yet stylized look. Altering the nose shape or removing whiskers would degrade facial accuracy.
    Question: Is the black nose centered on the white muzzle, with visible whisker lines extending from the sides of the snout?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The collar and tags are functional accessories that identify the figurine as a pet. Their **presence and position** around the neck are important for continuity. Even if made of wood, they must remain in place. Removing or relocating them would break the narrative logic of the object.
    Question: Is there a collar visible around the dog’s neck with at least one tag hanging from it?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
