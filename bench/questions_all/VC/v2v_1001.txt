### Step 1 - Description of Reference Image and Allowed Changes List

**Description of Reference Image:**  
The subject is a large dinosaur, specifically a sauropod, positioned in a misty forest setting. The dinosaur stands partially submerged in water, facing right with its long neck extended. Its skin appears textured and grayish-brown. The background consists of tall, slender trees shrouded in fog, creating an ethereal and serene atmosphere. The water reflects the dinosaur and surrounding trees faintly.

**Thinking Process:**  
The editing instructions specify adding a ketchup bottle and text while integrating them into the scene. This means the dinosaur, forest, and water elements should remain largely unchanged except for the addition of new elements. The instructions do not mention altering the dinosaur’s appearance, the forest's composition, or the water's reflective quality.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
1. Addition of a ketchup bottle in the lower-right corner, angled slightly toward the center.  
2. Insertion of the text “The king of flavors” in a glossy, ketchup-style script font, hovering in the air with ketchup streams linking back to the bottle.

### Step 2 - Determination of Elements That Should Remain Unchanged

**Thinking Process:**  
Core recognition elements include the dinosaur's distinct shape and posture, the forest's misty ambiance, and the reflective water surface. Functional/logical associations involve the dinosaur's placement in the water and the forest's naturalistic setting. Remaining elements like tree details and water reflections contribute to visual coherence.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
1. The dinosaur's shape, posture, and position in the water.  
2. The misty forest background with tall trees.  
3. The reflective quality of the water surface.  
4. The natural lighting and atmospheric haze.
