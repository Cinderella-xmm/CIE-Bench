Description of reference image: The subject consists of a man and a woman seated on a park bench, viewed from behind. They are positioned closely together under the shade of a large tree with lush green leaves. The man wears glasses, a dark jacket, and trousers; his body posture conveys a relaxed demeanor. The woman has long blonde hair and is dressed in a polka-dotted dress, sitting barefoot. The park setting includes grassy terrain, additional trees in the background, and distant buildings barely visible through a softly diffused light, suggesting early morning or late afternoon.

### Step 1 - Allowed Changes List:

**Thinking process:**  
The instructions specify designing the couple’s backs as a crystal silhouette. This means that the back silhouettes of both individuals may be transformed into crystal-like forms. However, this transformation should likely retain the outlines of their postures, ensuring they are still recognizable as a couple sitting side by side. The atmosphere and lighting conditions could also be adjusted subtly to complement the crystal effect, but other elements such as the park bench, tree, grassy background, and general scene composition should ideally remain.

**Allowed Changes List:**
1. Backs of the couple can be transformed into crystal silhouettes.
2. Potential subtle adjustments to lighting to enhance the crystal appearance.
3. Crystal texture applied to the silhouettes of the couple.

### Step 2 - Preservation Targets List:

**Thinking process:**  
Following the analysis, elements that define the couple as a pair sitting together and the contextual setting of the park should be preserved. Their relative positions and the core visual context of the park elements contribute significantly to the image's integrity.

**Preservation Targets List:**
1. The positioning of the couple on the bench (side by side, leaning slightly towards each other).
2. The park bench design and its placement.
3. The tree and its foliage.
4. The grassy field and general park environment.
5. The overall scene's early morning or late afternoon light quality.
