**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is an ornate antique pocket watch resting on a dark, weathered wooden surface composed of vertical planks with visible grain, knots, and natural discoloration. The watch has a circular, metallic case with richly detailed embossed floral and scrollwork patterns in a bronze or brass finish. At the center is a small circular clock face with Roman numerals (I to XII), black background, and gold-colored hour markers and hands. A central winding crown is located at the top of the watch, connected by a loop ring to a small knob. The outer edge of the watch case features a fine engraved border. The overall texture of the metal shows signs of age, including patina and subtle tarnishing. The lighting emphasizes depth and relief in the engravings, casting soft shadows that enhance the three-dimensional quality of the design. The wooden background provides a rustic contrast, with warm brown tones and pronounced wood grain.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction explicitly transforms the pocket watch into a whiskey bottle while preserving certain decorative elements. Key changes include:
- Changing the shape from circular to cylindrical (glass vessel).
- Replacing the clock face with a label reading "Timeless Reserve".
- Converting the top ring into a cap with a cork stopper.
- Retaining the intricate engravings as embossed patterns on the bottle.
- Adding gold accents to the cap and label area.

From this, we can infer:
- **Subject form**: The circular shape of the watch must be changed to a cylindrical glass bottle → allowed change.
- **Face/center element**: The clock face is replaced with a label → allowed change.
- **Top ring and knob**: Transformed into a bottle cap with cork → allowed change.
- **Engravings**: Must be preserved as embossed patterns → not fully changed; only repurposed.
- **Material**: Metal → glass → allowed change.
- **Scene/background**: Not mentioned for retention → may be altered, but no explicit instruction to change it → assumed optional.

However, the instruction specifies: *"maintaining the intricate engravings as embossed patterns"*, which implies these designs are to be retained in form and detail, even if transferred to a new object. Therefore, the **design pattern itself** is not allowed to be changed — only recontextualized.

Additionally, the **Roman numerals** are referenced again around the label’s edge, suggesting their presence must be preserved in some form.

Thus, the **allowed changes list** includes:

Allowed Changes List:  
- Shape of the main body (from circular to cylindrical)  
- Material (metal → glass)  
- Central face (clock → label)  
- Top structure (ring and knob → cap and cork)  
- Background (optional, not required to preserve)  
- Functional transformation (watch → whiskey bottle)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
We now determine what **must remain unchanged** based on exclusion from the allowed changes list and core recognition logic.

**Core recognition elements:**  
The original pocket watch is defined by its **distinctive ornamental style**, particularly:
- The **symmetrical floral and scrollwork engraving** surrounding the center — this is the dominant visual identity of the object.
- The **central clock face with Roman numerals** — although it will be replaced, the instruction specifies that Roman numerals should appear *around the label's edge*, meaning their **presence and format** are to be preserved.
- The **overall layout of decoration** — radial symmetry, placement of motifs, and density of detailing — constitutes the unique aesthetic signature.

These are **core identity features** because they define the artistic style and craftsmanship of the original object. If lost, the transformed object would lose its visual connection to the original.

**Functional/logical association elements:**  
Although the function changes (timepiece → liquor container), the **logical continuity** of the design is maintained through the reuse of decorative elements. The instruction does not allow changing the **nature of the ornamentation**, only its application. Thus, the **embossed patterns must retain their form, depth, and placement** relative to the center.

**Non-modified element deduction:**  
Even though the object changes shape, the following **visual details** from the original must be preserved:
- The **specific design motifs** (e.g., acanthus-like leaves, swirling scrolls, dot accents) — these are not generic but highly stylized.
- The **radial symmetry** of the design — essential to maintain visual coherence.
- The **Roman numeral sequence** — I, II, III, ..., XII — must appear somewhere in the final design, per instruction.
- The **texture and depth** of the engravings — implied by “embossed patterns” — must be preserved in appearance, even if material changes.

Note: The **wooden background** is not specified for preservation, so it may be changed. However, since it is part of the original composition and contributes to atmosphere, it is not required to be kept unless instructed.

Preservation Targets List:  
- The intricate floral and scrollwork embossed pattern surrounding the center  
- The radial symmetry of the decorative design  
- The presence and arrangement of Roman numerals (I–XII) in a circular layout  
- The depth and relief of the engravings (as embossed texture)  
- The central circular motif (even if reinterpreted as label or cap base)

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The symmetrical floral and scrollwork pattern is the defining visual characteristic of the watch's casing. It is not just decorative but structurally organized in a radial fashion, forming a continuous band around the central dial. This pattern is specifically mentioned to be preserved as embossed on the bottle. Losing this exact design would result in a loss of identity and artistic continuity, making the edited object unrecognizable as derived from the original. Hence, this is a core identity feature.
    Question: Is the radial floral and scrollwork pattern with symmetrical swirls and leaf-like motifs present around the central area of the object?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The Roman numerals (I to XII) are key functional and stylistic elements of the original clock face. Although the instruction replaces the face with a label, it explicitly requires that Roman numerals appear around the label’s edge. Their specific sequence and circular arrangement are essential to maintaining the temporal theme and visual consistency with the original. Without them, the thematic link between time and "Timeless Reserve" breaks down.
    Question: Are the Roman numerals I through XII arranged in a circular sequence around the central label or design element?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The embossed texture of the engravings gives the object its three-dimensional character and luxurious feel. The instruction specifies that these engravings become "embossed patterns" on the bottle, meaning their physical depth and raised nature must be visually preserved. If flattened or simplified, the transformation loses authenticity and fails to honor the original craftsmanship.
    Question: Do the decorative patterns exhibit clear embossed relief with visible depth and shadowing, indicating raised surfaces?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The central circular motif, originally housing the clock face, is a structural anchor point. Even though it becomes a label, the instruction implies it remains a focal point. Its position at the geometric center of the object maintains compositional balance. Removing or displacing it would disrupt the radial symmetry and weaken the design’s coherence.
    Question: Is there a clearly defined central circular element positioned at the geometric center of the object?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The dense arrangement of small dots and flourishes within the scrollwork adds richness and complexity to the design. These minor details contribute to the ornate aesthetic and distinguish it from simpler patterns. While not core identifiers alone, their absence would make the design appear simplified or inaccurate, affecting visual fidelity.
    Question: Are small decorative dots and filigree details integrated into the scrollwork, particularly at junctions and tips of curves?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
