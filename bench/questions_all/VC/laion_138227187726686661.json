      "thinking_process": "The red football with white laces is a core identifying feature of the quilt’s sports theme. Its distinct oval shape and lacing pattern are unique to American footballs and distinguish it from other balls. If this element is omitted or replaced with a non-football shape, the quilt loses its thematic integrity. Since the instruction says to “mimic” the balls with LEGO tiles, the shape must still be recognizable. Thus, preserving the football’s form is essential for identity recognition and carries maximum weight.",

      "thinking_process": "The soccer ball’s black-and-white hexagonal pattern is iconic and instantly recognizable. It is one of the most prominent elements in the quilt and serves as a key visual anchor. Replacing it with a generic round tile would fail to preserve the intended theme. Even in LEGO form, the pattern must retain the characteristic black pentagons and white hexagons to be identifiable. Therefore, its presence is critical for maintaining the original design’s identity.",

      "thinking_process": "The orange basketball with black lines is another defining element of the sports theme. Its circular shape and distinctive line pattern differentiate it from other balls. Removing or altering this would distort the thematic balance of the quilt. Since the instruction requires recreating the original patchwork design, the basketball must appear in the same relative location and form.",
      "question": "Is the orange basketball with black lines present in the quilt’s design?",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The white baseball with red stitching is a smaller but significant detail that contributes to the variety of sports represented. It adds completeness to the sports theme. Its presence ensures the quilt is not limited to just three sports. Even in LEGO form, the red stitching must be visible to maintain recognition. Omitting it would reduce the richness of the design and compromise the original intent.",
      "question": "Is the white baseball with red stitching present in the quilt’s design?",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The patchwork grid layout of squares is a structural element that defines the quilt’s composition. It organizes the sports balls and stars into a coherent pattern. If the layout is changed to a random or solid block arrangement, the design loses its original aesthetic and becomes unrecognizable. The instruction specifies “recreate the original patchwork design,” which implies the grid must be preserved.",
      "question": "Is the quilt composed of a grid of colored squares arranged in a patchwork pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The blue and white stars are recurring decorative elements that enhance the sports theme and provide visual contrast. They are not functional but are integral to the quilt’s design language. Their absence would make the pattern feel incomplete or unbalanced. Since they appear consistently in the original, they must be included in the LEGO version to maintain visual fidelity.",
      "question": "Are blue and white stars present between the sports ball motifs in the quilt?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The relative positioning of the sports balls within the grid is crucial for pattern recognition. For example, the football in the top-left corner, the soccer ball near the center, etc. Changing their positions would disrupt the visual logic and make the design unrecognizable as a recreation of the original. The instruction implies preservation of the design, so spatial relationships must be maintained.",
      "question": "Are the sports balls positioned in the same relative locations within the patchwork grid as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
