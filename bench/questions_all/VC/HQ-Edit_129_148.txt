**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a young Black girl seated gracefully on the ground in front of a large baobab tree with thick, textured trunks. She wears an elaborate traditional African-style dress made of vibrant green fabric adorned with large red and orange circular patterns, some filled with dotted textures. The dress has puffed short sleeves with red-orange trim and decorative beaded bands at the shoulders and arms. Her hair is styled into a high, intricate braided crown wrapped with multicolored fabric in black, red, and green, forming a sculptural headdress. She wears multiple layered silver necklaces around her neck and gold bangles on her upper arms. Her posture is composed, with hands gently resting on her lap, facing forward with a calm expression. The background features a warm golden-hour lighting, dry grass beneath her, and blurred natural scenery suggesting a savanna environment. The texture of the tree bark is deeply grooved and earth-toned, contributing to the natural authenticity of the scene.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction specifies transforming the original image into a **miniature diorama inside a vintage globe**, where the figure becomes a **stylized 3D model**, still **seated gracefully**. The new setting includes:  
- A **vintage globe** as the container  
- An **earthy color palette** with **vibrant tribal patterns mirrored on walls**  
- **Tiny, detailed roots interwoven beneath** for depth  
- **Miniature wildlife** peeking from the textured ground  

Key transformation points:  
- The **subject’s form** is to become a **stylized 3D model** → implies allowed changes in rendering style (e.g., smoother surfaces, stylization), but **not necessarily altering identity-defining features**  
- The **scene is completely replaced** by a globe-based diorama → background, environment, scale, and spatial context are changed  
- **"Seated gracefully"** is preserved → posture must remain consistent  
- **"Vibrant tribal patterns mirrored on walls"** → indicates that **the pattern design** (from the dress) should be **reused in the environment**, so **pattern motifs must be retained**  
- **"Tiny, detailed roots interwoven beneath"** → suggests **root-like structures** should be present, but these are **new elements not in original**, so not required to retain original roots  
- **"Miniature wildlife"** → new addition, not present originally, so not required to retain  

Thus, **allowed changes** include:  
- Environment/background: fully replaced by globe diorama  
- Scale: reduced to miniature  
- Rendering style: stylized 3D model  
- New elements: roots, wildlife, globe structure  
- Scene lighting and atmosphere: modified to fit enclosed globe setting  

However, **the subject’s core identity and key visual traits** must remain recognizable despite stylization, especially since she is central to the narrative.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
- Background environment (baobab tree, savanna, sky)  
- Lighting and overall atmosphere  
- Texture and material rendering (e.g., smooth 3D surface vs. photographic detail)  
- Scale and perspective (miniature diorama)  
- Addition of new elements: vintage globe, mirrored tribal patterns on walls, tiny roots, miniature animals  
- Styling of figure: stylized 3D model representation  
- Positional context: now inside a globe, not outdoors

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
We now apply exclusion logic to identify what **must be preserved** based on the original image and constraints from the instructions.

**Core recognition elements:**  
- The **subject’s face**: facial features (dark skin tone, almond-shaped eyes, defined cheekbones, full lips) are essential for identity recognition. Even if stylized, the **proportions and expression** must remain consistent.  
- The **distinctive hairstyle**: the high braided crown wrapped in black, red, and green fabric forms a unique sculptural shape — this is a **key cultural identifier** and must be preserved in form, even if rendered differently.  
- The **dress pattern**: the **green base with red/orange polka dots**, some with internal dot textures, is a signature design element. It is explicitly referenced in the instruction ("vibrant tribal patterns mirrored on walls") — thus, **this pattern must be preserved** in both the dress and the environment.  
- The **posture**: "seated gracefully" is explicitly stated — the **sitting position with hands folded on lap** must be maintained.  
- The **neckwear**: multiple silver necklaces stacked around the neck — this is a **cultural accessory** and part of the character’s identity; it must remain visible and structurally intact.  
- The **arm bangles**: gold-colored bracelets on upper arms — another **identity-defining accessory**, must be retained.  

**Functional/logical association elements:**  
- The **relationship between the subject and her attire**: the dress must still be worn correctly — no change in how it drapes or fits.  
- The **visual coherence of accessories**: necklaces and bangles must remain attached to the body in correct anatomical positions.  
- The **spatial orientation**: even in a globe, the subject must remain **seated upright**, facing forward — this preserves the emotional tone and narrative focus.  

**Non-modified element deduction:**  
After excluding allowed changes (background, lighting, scale), all **subject-specific visual details not mentioned as changeable** must be preserved. These include:  
- The **color scheme** of the dress and headdress (green, red, orange, black) — crucial for cultural authenticity and pattern replication  
- The **texture of the fabric** (visible weave and dot fillings) — important for identifying the textile style  
- The **shape of the puffed sleeves** — a distinctive silhouette  
- The **layered structure of the necklace** — multiple strands, not single  

These are not explicitly mentioned as changeable, and their removal would distort the character’s identity and violate the instruction's intent to mirror tribal patterns.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
- The subject’s facial features (skin tone, eye shape, expression)  
- The high braided crown hairstyle with black, red, and green fabric wrapping  
- The green dress with red and orange circular patterns (some with internal dot textures)  
- The posture of being seated with hands resting on lap  
- The multiple layered silver necklaces around the neck  
- The gold bangles on upper arms  
- The puffed short sleeves with red-orange trim  
- The color palette of green, red, orange, and black in clothing and headdress  
- The structural integrity of the dress (full skirt, fitted bodice)

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The high braided crown with black, red, and green fabric is a unique and culturally significant feature of the subject’s identity. Its sculptural shape and color arrangement are essential for recognition. If altered or simplified, the character would lose her distinctiveness. This is a core identity element, hence weight 3.
    Question: Is the high braided crown hairstyle with black, red, and green fabric wrapping preserved in the edited image?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The green dress with red and orange circular patterns (some containing internal dot textures) is a defining visual trait. The instruction explicitly references mirroring this pattern in the environment, confirming its importance. Loss of this pattern would break continuity and cultural representation. This is a core identity and functional element, hence weight 3.
    Question: Is the green dress with red and orange circular patterns (some with internal dot textures) preserved in the edited image?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The subject’s seated posture with hands resting on her lap is explicitly required by the instruction ("seated gracefully"). This defines her demeanor and spatial relationship. Changing this would contradict the narrative intent. It is a key functional and compositional element, hence weight 3.
    Question: Is the subject seated with her hands resting on her lap in the edited image?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The multiple layered silver necklaces are a prominent cultural accessory and integral to the subject’s appearance. Their presence and stacking pattern contribute to identity. Removing or simplifying them would alter the character’s visual authenticity. This is an important accessory element, hence weight 2.
    Question: Are the multiple layered silver necklaces around the neck preserved in the edited image?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The gold bangles on the upper arms are specific accessories that add cultural detail. While not as central as the dress or hairstyle, they are part of the complete visual identity. Their absence would reduce authenticity. This is a secondary but identifiable detail, hence weight 2.
    Question: Are the gold bangles on the upper arms preserved in the edited image?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The puffed short sleeves with red-orange trim are a distinctive silhouette feature of the dress. They contribute to the garment’s cultural style and must be preserved to maintain visual consistency. This is a minor but coherent detail, hence weight 1.
    Question: Are the puffed short sleeves with red-orange trim preserved in the edited image?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}
{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The facial features — including skin tone, eye shape, and expression — are critical for recognizing the subject. Even in stylized form, these must remain consistent to preserve identity. This is a core recognition element, hence weight 3.
    Question: Are the facial features (dark skin tone, almond-shaped eyes, calm expression) preserved in the edited image?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
