      "thinking_process": "The arched-top wooden treasure chest with brass-riveted metal bands is the central object and core identifier of the scene. Its distinctive dome-shaped lid and horizontal metal straps with evenly spaced rivets are unique to this type of pirate chest. If these structural features are altered or omitted, the object loses its identity as a traditional treasure chest, undermining the entire theme. Therefore, this is a 3-point core recognition element.",
      "question": "Is the treasure chest depicted with an arched top and horizontal metal bands secured by brass rivets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The brass ring handle on the left side of the chest is a functional and iconic feature. It is a signature detail that distinguishes this chest from others and provides a visual anchor. Its absence would make the chest look incomplete or generic. Since the instruction specifies the chest as a central landmark, its key components like the handle must be preserved. This is a 3-point core identification element.",
      "question": "Is there a brass ring handle attached to the left side of the treasure chest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The ornate lock mechanism on the right front panel is a detailed and unique feature that adds authenticity and visual interest. It is part of the chest’s functional design and contributes to its aged, valuable appearance. Removing or altering it would reduce the chest’s recognizability and historical feel. As a distinctive accessory, it is essential for maintaining the chest's identity. This is a 2-point important element.",
      "question": "Is there an ornate lock mechanism present on the right front panel of the chest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The coiled rope knot in the foreground is a key compositional element that grounds the scene and ties it to the ship setting. Its size, shape, and texture are specific and help establish the maritime context. Even if the background changes, the rope must remain intact to maintain continuity with the original scene. This is a 2-point important scene element.",
      "question": "Is there a large coiled rope knot positioned in the foreground to the left of the chest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The scattered pile of gold coins, gemstones, and pottery vessels directly represents the treasure and is referenced in the legend. Their presence, color variety, and arrangement are crucial for the narrative. Altering or removing them would contradict the instruction to include them in the legend. This is a 2-point key accessory element.",
      "question": "Are gold coins, colorful gemstones, and small golden pottery vessels visible near the base of the chest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The positioning of the chest relative to the rope and treasure pile establishes spatial logic. The chest must remain adjacent to both the rope knot and the treasure pile to preserve the original scene’s coherence. Changing this layout would disrupt the narrative flow and visual balance. This is a 1-point logical relationship element.",
      "question": "Is the treasure chest positioned between the coiled rope knot and the pile of coins and gems?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The sails and rigging in the background are critical for establishing the ship setting. Although they will be reused as decorative borders, their original form—vertical ropes and billowing sails—must be preserved to maintain thematic cohesion. Their absence would break the connection to the nautical theme. This is a 2-point important environmental element.",
      "question": "Are vertical rigging ropes and partially visible sails present in the background behind the chest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
