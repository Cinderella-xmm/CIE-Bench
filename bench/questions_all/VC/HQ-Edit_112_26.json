      "thinking_process": "The Siamese cat’s distinct coloration—cream body with dark brown points on ears, face, paws, and tail—is a core identity feature. Without this pattern, the cat would not be recognizable as a Siamese, especially since the instruction specifies a realistic figure must be included beside the box. This trait is essential for breed identification and must be preserved in the realistic version.",
      "question": "Does the realistic cat figure retain the cream-colored body with dark brown points on the ears, face, paws, and tail?",

      "thinking_process": "The bright blue eyes are a defining trait of Siamese cats and are highly prominent in the original image. Their vividness and reflective quality contribute to the cat’s iconic look. Since the instruction requires a lifelike product showcase, the eye color and clarity must be preserved in the realistic figure to maintain authenticity.",

      "thinking_process": "The curled tail forming a dark ring beneath the body is a unique posture in the original image, contributing to the cat’s elegant and composed appearance. This pose is visually distinctive and likely serves as a signature detail. It should be preserved in the realistic figure to maintain continuity with the original.",
      "question": "Is the tail of the realistic cat figure curled tightly around its body, forming a dark ring underneath?",

      "thinking_process": "The wooden windowsill with visible horizontal plank texture and warm tone provides a natural base for the scene and is referenced in the instruction to emphasize \"natural textures.\" Its presence supports the realism of the product showcase. Even if the overall scene is transformed, the wood grain and structure must remain consistent.",
      "question": "Is the wooden windowsill present with visible horizontal planks and warm brown tone?",

      "thinking_process": "The ceramic vase with blue floral pattern and pinkish-purple spherical flowers is a key decorative element in the original image. Although it may be stylized in the final design, its presence and basic form are important for maintaining visual coherence and serving as a source of floral theme inspiration. It should be retained in the scene.",
      "question": "Is the small ceramic vase with blue floral pattern and pinkish-purple spherical flowers present on the windowsill?",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The natural fur texture—smooth, softly shaded with subtle gradients—is critical for achieving the \"lifelike product showcase\" mentioned in the instruction. This detail differentiates the realistic figure from the stylized chibi version and ensures authenticity. It must be preserved in the realistic cat figure.",
      "question": "Does the realistic cat figure display smooth, softly shaded fur with natural gradients and texture?",

      "thinking_process": "The window frame and outdoor scenery (trees, hills, overcast sky) establish the original setting and context. Although the instruction introduces a new isometric view, the background environment likely remains relevant for scene logic and aesthetic continuity. Retaining the window structure and general landscape helps preserve the intended atmosphere.",
