Description of reference image: The subject is a transparent glass perfume bottle with a faceted, geometric design featuring a repeating star-like pattern across its surface. The bottle has a cylindrical shape with slightly tapered sides and a flat base. It contains a golden-hued liquid that reflects light through the cut facets. The cap is a polished gold-colored metallic structure composed of a faceted spherical knob atop a short cylindrical neck, which connects to the bottle via a threaded collar. A small nozzle on the side of the neck emits a fine mist of spray, visible as a soft, diffused plume extending diagonally into the air. The background consists of a rich, brown satin fabric with smooth folds and subtle sheen, creating gentle undulations across the surface. The lighting is warm and directional, casting soft highlights on the bottle’s facets and the fabric’s creases, while the overall tone of the image is deep and luxurious, with a dark brown backdrop that enhances contrast.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions: "Convert the perfume bottle and the fabric background into a stop-motion diorama made entirely of Lego bricks." This explicitly states that both the perfume bottle and the fabric background are to be transformed in form—specifically, they must be reimagined as constructed from Lego bricks. Therefore, the physical materials (glass, metal, fabric) and their real-world textures are no longer required. However, the instruction does not mention altering the **form**, **structure**, or **function** of the objects. The transformation is only in medium (Lego), not in identity. Thus, the **shape**, **proportions**, **position**, **functional elements** (like the spray nozzle), and **spatial relationship** between the bottle and the background must remain consistent. The core identity of the object—the perfume bottle with its specific geometry and spray action—and the scene layout (bottle resting on fabric) must be preserved despite material substitution.

Allowed Changes List:
- Material of the perfume bottle (from glass and metal to Lego bricks)
- Texture of the bottle (from smooth, reflective glass to blocky, matte Lego surfaces)
- Material of the fabric background (from satin to Lego bricks)
- Surface finish of the bottle and fabric (from glossy to plastic brick texture)
- Light reflection behavior (from realistic refraction to simplified Lego shading)

Step 2- Determine the elements that should remain unchanged  
Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements: The perfume bottle's identity hinges on its distinctive **faceted geometric pattern**, **cylindrical body with tapered sides**, **gold faceted cap**, and **side-mounted spray nozzle emitting mist**. These features are essential for identifying it as a perfume bottle with a specific design. The **spray plume** is a functional indicator of use and must remain present to preserve the narrative of spraying. The **overall silhouette and proportions** of the bottle are critical for visual recognition. Similarly, the **fabric background** must retain its **undulating folds and placement beneath the bottle** to maintain spatial logic and context. Even though it becomes Lego, its **form and layout** must match the original.

Functional/logical association elements: The **nozzle’s position** and the **direction of the spray plume** are functionally linked—changing them would break the logic of how a perfume bottle operates. The **bottle’s placement on the fabric** establishes a stable, grounded composition; this spatial relationship must be preserved to maintain realism within the new medium.

Non modified element deduction: After excluding allowed changes (material, texture, reflectivity), the remaining unmentioned aspects—such as the **exact shape of the facets**, **number and arrangement of the star patterns**, **relative size of the cap to the body**, **angle of the spray**, and **fold patterns of the fabric**—must be retained to ensure visual fidelity. These are not explicitly changed by the instruction and are necessary for coherence.

Preservation Targets List:  
- The faceted star-shaped pattern on the body of the perfume bottle  
- The cylindrical shape with tapered sides and flat base  
- The gold faceted spherical cap on top of the bottle  
- The side-mounted spray nozzle and the visible mist plume emanating from it  
- The position and direction of the spray plume relative to the nozzle  
- The undulating folds of the fabric background beneath the bottle  
- The spatial relationship between the bottle and the fabric (bottle resting on fabric)  

Q1:  
Thinking process: The faceted star-shaped pattern is the defining decorative feature of the bottle, responsible for its unique visual identity. Its presence and geometric repetition are key to recognizing the bottle’s design. If lost in the Lego version, the bottle would appear generic and fail to match the original. This is a core identity element, hence weight 3.  
Question: Is the faceted star-shaped pattern covering the body of the perfume bottle preserved in the Lego version?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The cylindrical shape with tapered sides and flat base defines the bottle’s silhouette. Altering this would change the fundamental form and make it unrecognizable as the same object. This is a core structural element, essential for identification.  
Question: Does the perfume bottle maintain its cylindrical shape with tapered sides and flat base in the Lego construction?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The gold faceted spherical cap is a distinct component that contributes to the bottle’s elegance and design symmetry. Its shape and position are iconic. Losing it would alter the bottle’s appearance significantly.  
Question: Is the gold faceted spherical cap positioned at the top of the bottle preserved in the Lego version?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The side-mounted spray nozzle and the visible mist plume are functional indicators of the bottle’s use. Their presence and orientation are crucial for maintaining the narrative of spraying. Removing or misplacing them breaks the logical consistency.  
Question: Is the spray nozzle located on the side of the bottle’s neck, with a visible mist plume extending diagonally outward, preserved in the Lego version?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The undulating folds of the fabric background provide context and grounding for the bottle. Their shape and placement are essential for maintaining the scene’s composition. Changing them would disrupt the spatial relationship.  
Question: Are the undulating folds of the fabric background beneath the bottle preserved in form and position in the Lego version?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The spatial relationship between the bottle and the fabric—specifically, the bottle resting on the fabric—is a logical anchor. If the bottle floats or is placed elsewhere, the scene loses coherence. This is an important scene element.  
Question: Is the perfume bottle positioned directly on top of the fabric background, maintaining contact and alignment with the folds, in the Lego version?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The relative size and proportion of the cap to the bottle body are part of the design balance. If the cap is disproportionately large or small, the bottle’s aesthetic is compromised. This is a detail-level but important proportional element.  
Question: Is the size of the gold cap proportionally consistent with the body of the bottle in the Lego version?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
