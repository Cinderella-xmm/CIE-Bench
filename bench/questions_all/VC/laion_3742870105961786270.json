      "thinking_process": "The cluster of purple grapes is a core visual element in the basket, uniquely identifiable by their dense, spherical arrangement and deep purple coloration. These grapes are a signature feature of the harvest theme and distinguish this figure from others. Their absence would remove a key narrative and aesthetic component. Therefore, their presence and form must be preserved, even if stylized.",

      "thinking_process": "The heart-shaped engraving on the small jug is a distinctive decorative motif that serves as a unique identifier for the object. It is not common in typical jugs and adds symbolic value. Losing this detail would result in the loss of a key attribute that defines the jug’s character in the original image.",
      "question": "Is the heart-shaped engraving present on the small terracotta jug?",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The white goose with an orange beak and webbed feet is a defining secondary character in the scene. Its presence at the woman’s feet is both spatially and narratively significant. Even if transformed into a charm, the basic form (head, beak, body, wings, legs) must remain to maintain recognition. This is a core identity feature of the original composition.",
      "question": "Is the goose depicted with a white body, orange beak, and webbed feet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The gold clasp on the cloak is a small but important detail that adds authenticity to the costume. It is located at the neck and contrasts with the surrounding fabric. While subtle, it is a consistent feature across similar figurines and contributes to the visual richness. Its absence would reduce the fidelity of the costume representation.",
      "question": "Is there a gold-colored clasp visible at the neckline of the cloak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The basket containing multiple fruits (including a red apple, green pear, and purple grapes) is a key accessory that conveys abundance and rural life. The combination of these specific fruits and their placement in a woven basket is a recognizable feature. Removing or altering this basket would disrupt the thematic integrity of the figure.",
      "question": "Is the basket holding a red apple, green pear, and purple grapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The relative position of the basket near the woman’s waist is crucial for maintaining the posture and balance of the figure. It is held in her left arm and sits against her side. Changing its location significantly would alter the dynamic of the pose and undermine the original composition.",
      "question": "Is the basket positioned near the woman’s waist, held in her left arm?",

        "Yes",
