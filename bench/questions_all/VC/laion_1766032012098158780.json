      "thinking_process": "The flared leg silhouette is the most iconic and defining shape of the jeans in the original image. It distinguishes them from straight-leg or skinny jeans and is explicitly referenced in the instruction as the basis for shaping the perfume bottle. Without this silhouette, the design would lose its essential connection to the original jeans, making it unrecognizable as a derivative. Therefore, the presence and shape of the flared legs are critical for identity preservation.",
      "question": "Is the flared leg silhouette preserved in the transformed design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The lace-up details on the outer sides of the lower legs are a distinctive and non-standard feature of the jeans, adding visual interest and serving as a unique identifier. The instruction explicitly states to incorporate these as decorative elements in the perfume bottle, indicating they must be retained in some form. Their absence would break the visual link between the original jeans and the transformed design.",
      "question": "Are the lace-up details present on the outer sides of the lower legs in the transformed design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The denim blue color is central to the identity of the jeans and is directly preserved in the instruction through \"transparent glass tinted with denim blue.\" This ensures the color remains consistent with the original, maintaining visual continuity. Changing the color would disrupt the thematic and aesthetic link between the original jeans and the perfume bottle.",
      "question": "Is the denim blue color retained in the transformed design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The side profile view is the primary perspective used in the original image to showcase the full silhouette of the jeans, especially the flare. While the instruction does not specify viewing angle, preserving the side view ensures consistency in how the flared shape and lace-up details are displayed. Changing the angle could obscure key identifying features.",
      "question": "Is the side profile view maintained in the transformed design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The proportional relationship between the upper leg and the flared bottom is essential to the visual balance and recognition of the jeans. The instruction preserves the \"flared leg jeans silhouette,\" which implies maintaining the relative proportions. Altering this ratio would distort the intended shape and weaken the design's authenticity.",
      "question": "Is the proportional length and tapering from knee to ankle preserved in the transformed design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
