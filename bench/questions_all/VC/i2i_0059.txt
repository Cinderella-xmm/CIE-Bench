**Description of reference image:**  
The image shows a plated meal consisting of a seared steak accompanied by a side of mixed vegetables, including broccoli, carrots, and baby potatoes. The steak has a charred and cooked appearance. The vegetables include bright orange carrots, green broccoli florets, and golden potatoes garnished with herbs. A lemon slice rests next to the potatoes, adding a touch of color. The plate is seated on a colorful, striped tablecloth. 

**Thinking process:**  
- **Analyzing changes:**  
  - The instructions specify transforming an "elephant" – however, this image does not contain an elephant. Thus, the described changes do not apply here, as there is no original subject or scene matching the instructions.  
  - Instructions mention replacing the scene, but since the current image contains food, there’s no direct relevance to steampunk, mechanical elephants, or foggy brass forests.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
None applicable because the editing instructions do not match the original image content.

**Step 2 - Determine elements that should remain unchanged:**  
Thinking process:  
- **Core recognition elements:** The key elements are the food items themselves—the seared steak, mixed vegetables—and their visual presentation. The unique shape of the broccoli florets, the glossy texture of the carrot slices, and the charred surface of the steak are essential identifiers.  
- **Functional/logical association elements:** The arrangement of the food on the plate and the positioning relative to each other contribute to the logical presentation of the dish.  
- **Remaining elements:** The colorful tablecloth beneath the plate adds contextual setting and should be retained for visual coherence.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
(Food items: steak, broccoli, carrots, potatoes)  
(Plate arrangement)  
(Tablecloth context)
