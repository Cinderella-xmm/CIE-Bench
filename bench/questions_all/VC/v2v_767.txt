### Step 1 - Description of Reference Image and Allowed Changes List:

**Description of Reference Image:**  
The image depicts an ancient stone temple emerging from a dense jungle. The temple has a tiered structure with a rectangular base and progressively smaller levels leading up to a flat top. The architecture features intricate carvings and weathered textures, suggesting age and historical significance. The surrounding jungle is lush, with various trees and foliage partially obscuring the temple. The lighting is soft, creating a mysterious and serene atmosphere.

**Thinking Process:**  
The instructions specify designing a creature inspired by the temple, requiring the creature to reflect the temple's shape, textures, and ambiance. The scene's core elements, like the temple's structure and jungle setting, should influence the creature's design. However, the temple and jungle do not need to be physically present in the final image. The orb or capsule must align with the temple's architectural details and natural elements. The creature's name and elemental type should also be included.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
- The temple and jungle can be replaced with a full-body depiction of the creature.
- The scene can be transformed to fit a fantasy monster-catching universe.
- The temple's shape, textures, and ambiance can inspire the creature's design but don't need to be directly depicted.
- The orb/capsule design can be customized while aligning with the temple's details.
- The creature's name and elemental type can be added as text elements.

### Step 2 - Preservation Targets List:

**Thinking Process:**  
Core recognition elements include the temple's tiered structure and weathered textures, which should inspire the creature's design. Functional/logical elements involve the creature's connection to the temple's mystique and the orb/capsule's alignment with the temple's details. Remaining elements like the jungle's lushness can inform the creature's aesthetic but aren't mandatory.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
- The tiered structure and weathered textures of the temple (core recognition).
- The mystical ambiance suggested by the temple and jungle (functional/logical).
- The architectural details and natural elements of the temple (remaining elements).
