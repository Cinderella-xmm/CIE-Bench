      "thinking_process": "The curved shape of the fairway is a core functional element of the golf course, defining the play path and terrain. It is visually distinct due to its smooth, rolling contours that guide the eye from the foreground toward the green. If this shape is distorted or removed, the scene loses its identity as a golf hole. Thus, it is a key structural feature that must be preserved.",
      "question": "Is the curved contour of the fairway, leading from the foreground toward the green, preserved in its original shape?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The sand bunkers are essential hazards in golf course design. Their presence and placement are key to identifying the hole’s difficulty and layout. Even if their texture changes, their physical location and shape must remain to maintain functional consistency. Altering their position would misrepresent the course.",
      "question": "Are the sand bunkers located in their original positions along the fairway, particularly near the green and on the left side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The water hazard in the foreground is a major obstacle and a defining feature of the hole. Its presence and position relative to the fairway are critical for scene recognition. Even if its reflection is transformed, the water body itself must remain in place to preserve the spatial logic of the course.",
      "question": "Is the water hazard present in the foreground, directly bordering the fairway, and reflecting the sky and structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The AT&T GOLF tower and the white event tents are identifiable landmarks that anchor the scene as a professional golf tournament. Their placement in the right midground provides contextual clues about the event. Moving or removing them would break the scene’s narrative coherence.",
      "question": "Are the AT&T GOLF tower and the white event tents located in the right midground, adjacent to the spectator area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The general slope and elevation of the green area, particularly the rise toward the back, are important for understanding the hole’s design. This topography influences ball movement and player strategy. Preserving this gradient ensures the course remains recognizable.",
      "question": "Is the green area elevated at the back, forming a slight incline from the fairway?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The cluster of spectators along the fairway indicates a live event. While their appearance may be abstracted, their general grouping and density along the edge of the course help establish the scene’s atmosphere. Removing or dispersing them entirely would make the event feel empty or unreal.",
      "question": "Is there a dense group of spectators visible along the edge of the fairway, especially near the green?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
