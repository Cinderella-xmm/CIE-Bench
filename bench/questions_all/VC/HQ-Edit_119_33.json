      "question_id": "Q1",
      "thinking_process": "The dark brown skin tone is a core identity feature of the subject. Changing it would fundamentally alter her racial and ethnic identity, making her unrecognizable from the original. Since the instruction does not specify changing skin tone, and no artistic transformation typically alters base pigmentation unless stated, this must be preserved. It is a key identifier and cannot be sacrificed without losing the subject’s identity.",
      "question": "Is the subject's skin tone dark brown?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The presence of a sunflower in the subject's hair is a key compositional and symbolic element. It links her directly to the sunflower field and is a distinctive detail. Although the instruction allows modification of the hairstyle and flower, it implies retention through the phrase \"modify the braided hairstyle and dress\"—suggesting the flower is part of the hair design to be reimagined, not removed. Its absence would break the visual narrative.",
      "question": "Is there at least one sunflower placed in the subject's hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The subject is wearing a yellow dress. While the instruction allows modifying the dress into swirling Art Nouveau motifs, it does not allow changing the garment type or color category. The yellow hue is central to the visual harmony with the sunflowers. Retaining the yellow color ensures continuity with the original theme. Even if stylized, the dress must remain yellow.",
      "question": "Is the subject wearing a yellow dress?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The subject’s head is turned slightly to her right, with her gaze directed toward the viewer. This pose establishes engagement and warmth. Changing the angle or direction of her head would alter the emotional tone and viewer connection. Since the instruction does not mention changing posture, and the pose is integral to the original composition, it must be preserved.",
      "question": "Is the subject's head turned slightly to her right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The background is a sunflower field extending into the distance. While the instruction mandates transforming it into an Art Nouveau tapestry, the **presence of the field** must be retained. The subject is embedded within it. Removing the field or replacing it with an unrelated environment would violate the core scene logic. Thus, the **field must remain**, even if stylized.",
      "question": "Is the subject standing within a sunflower field?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The lighting suggests golden hour, with warm highlights on the subject’s face and shoulders. This light source comes from the upper right and casts soft shadows. While the instruction allows stylistic changes, altering the lighting direction would disrupt the mood and realism. Since no alternative lighting is specified, the original directional lighting should be preserved in essence.",
      "question": "Is the light source coming from the upper right side of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The subject has a gentle smile showing white teeth. This expression is a defining emotional feature. Changing it to a neutral or different expression would alter the mood of the image. The instruction does not mention changing facial expression, so it should remain consistent.",
      "question": "Does the subject have a visible smile showing her teeth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
