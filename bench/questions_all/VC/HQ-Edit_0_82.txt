**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is an elderly man with white hair and a long white beard, standing in a dynamic tai chi stance on a tiled platform. He wears a light blue, flowing traditional Chinese robe with wide sleeves and matching pants. His right leg is bent in a low lunge, left leg slightly raised behind him, barefoot. His right hand forms an "ok" gesture near his face, while the left hand rests gently at his waist. The background features a misty, ethereal garden path lined with cherry blossom trees in full bloom, their pink flowers contrasting against green foliage. The trees curve gracefully along a winding path that recedes into soft fog. A warm sunrise or sunset glows in the upper-right corner, casting golden light through the haze. The ground beneath the man is made of large, square gray tiles with visible grout lines.

Thinking process:  
The editing instruction specifies transforming the image into a **Zen-themed calendar panel**, which includes:
- Changing the style to **subtle line-art** (i.e., sketch-like outlines)
- Softening colors to **pastel watercolors**
- Adding **cherry blossom patterns** in the background
- Integrating **minimalistic monthly date grids**
- Each day’s space should **reflect the subject’s balanced pose**

From this, we can determine:
- The **subject's form** (elderly man) and **pose** (tai chi stance) are to be preserved but stylized
- The **style** (realistic → line-art + watercolor) is explicitly changed
- The **color palette** is allowed to shift to pastels
- The **background elements** (trees, path, sky) are to be transformed with added **cherry blossom patterns**
- The **calendar grid** is new content not present in original
- The **subject’s clothing**, **posture**, and **bare feet** are likely retained in structure but not necessarily texture

Allowed Changes List:  
(Specific element 1 that allows for changes): Visual style (from realistic rendering to subtle line-art)  
(Specific element 2 that allows for changes): Color scheme (to pastel watercolor tones)  
(Specific element 3 that allows for changes): Background textures and composition (addition of cherry blossom patterns)  
(Specific element 4 that allows for changes): Addition of minimalistic monthly date grids  
(Specific element 5 that allows for changes): Rendering technique (e.g., brushstroke effects, transparency, layering)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements:  
- The **elderly man’s posture** — specifically the **low lunge with one leg raised**, **right hand forming an "ok" gesture**, and **left hand at waist** — is central to identifying the action as tai chi. This is not just a pose but a recognizable martial arts stance. Even if stylized, its **structure and balance** must be preserved to maintain the identity of the practice.
- The **bare feet** and **traditional robe** are key cultural identifiers; removing them would alter the authenticity of the scene.
- The **cherry blossom trees** in the background are not only scenic but also symbolic of Zen and springtime renewal. While their appearance may be softened, their **presence and form** (curved trunks, flowering branches) must remain to preserve the thematic setting.
- The **tiled platform** under the man grounds the figure spatially and provides contrast to the natural background. Its **grid pattern** is a structural anchor.

Functional/logical association elements:  
- The **relationship between the man and the environment** — he stands on the platform facing the sunrise, surrounded by blooming trees — creates a narrative of harmony. This **spatial relationship** (man in foreground, path leading into distance, sun rising) supports the Zen theme and should be preserved even if stylized.
- The **balance of the tai chi stance** implies motion and stillness simultaneously; altering limb positions could disrupt the functional logic of the pose.

Non-modified element deduction:  
- Despite changes in style and color, the **core silhouette** of the man (including head shape, beard, robe flow, and foot position) must remain intact. These define the subject’s identity.
- The **tree canopy shape**, **blossom distribution**, and **path curvature** are unique visual cues in the original that contribute to atmosphere and depth. They must be retained in form, even if rendered differently.

Preservation Targets List:  
(Element 1 that should be maintained): The elderly man’s tai chi stance — right leg bent in lunge, left leg lifted behind, right hand in "ok" gesture near face, left hand at waist  
(Element 2 that should be maintained): Bare feet on the tiled platform  
(Element 3 that should be maintained): Light blue traditional robe with wide sleeves and flowing fabric folds  
(Element 4 that should be maintained): Cherry blossom trees with curved trunks and pink blossoms lining the path  
(Element 5 that should be maintained): Tiled platform with visible square tiles and grout lines  
(Element 6 that should be maintained): Spatial composition — man in foreground, path curving into mist, sunrise glow in upper-right  
(Element 7 that should be maintained): Long white beard and white hair of the elderly man

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

Q1:  
Thinking process: The tai chi stance is the core action being depicted and defines the subject’s purpose in the image. The specific configuration — right leg forward in lunge, left leg raised, hands positioned in precise gestures — is essential to identifying the practice. If this pose is altered, the image loses its meaning as a tai chi depiction. This is a 3-point element because it is both functionally and culturally significant.  
Question: Is the elderly man in a tai chi stance with his right leg bent in a lunge, left leg raised behind him, right hand forming an "ok" gesture near his face, and left hand resting at his waist?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3

Q2:  
Thinking process: The bare feet are a key detail indicating simplicity, grounding, and connection to nature — central to Zen philosophy. They also distinguish the figure from someone wearing shoes. Removing or covering them would change the subject’s identity and context. Though the style may shift, the presence of bare feet must be retained. This is a 2-point element due to its symbolic and visual importance.  
Question: Are the man’s feet bare, with the right foot flat on the tile and the left foot raised behind him?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2

Q3:  
Thinking process: The light blue traditional robe is a defining feature of the subject’s attire and cultural identity. Its flowing sleeves and layered fabric folds contribute to the sense of movement and grace. Even if rendered in line-art or watercolor, the shape and color must remain identifiable. Changing it to modern clothing would break the authenticity. This is a 2-point element due to its role in character identification.  
Question: Does the man wear a light blue traditional robe with wide sleeves and visible fabric folds?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2

Q4:  
Thinking process: The cherry blossom trees are not just scenery but iconic symbols of transience and beauty in Zen culture. Their curved trunks and pink blossoms are distinctive visual markers in the background. Even if stylized, their presence and general form must be preserved to maintain the thematic integrity. This is a 2-point element as it defines the environmental context.  
Question: Are there cherry blossom trees with pink flowers and curved dark trunks lining a path in the background?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2

Q5:  
Thinking process: The tiled platform provides a clear ground plane and contrasts with the natural environment. Its square tiles and visible grout lines are specific geometric details that anchor the figure spatially. Altering or removing them would disrupt the composition and make the scene feel ungrounded. This is a 1-point element as it is a structural detail supporting coherence.  
Question: Is the man standing on a surface composed of large square tiles with visible grout lines?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1

Q6:  
Thinking process: The long white beard and hair are key features identifying the man as elderly and wise, aligning with the Zen master archetype. They are part of his facial identity and cannot be removed without changing who he is. This is a 2-point element due to its role in character recognition.  
Question: Does the man have long white hair and a long white beard?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2

Q7:  
Thinking process: The spatial layout — man in front, path curving into mist, sunrise in upper-right — establishes the scene’s mood and direction. This compositional relationship is crucial for visual storytelling. Even if simplified, the relative positioning must remain consistent. This is a 2-point element as it governs the overall scene logic.  
Question: Is the man positioned in the foreground, facing toward the right side of the image, with a curved path receding into mist behind him and a bright light source in the upper-right corner?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2
