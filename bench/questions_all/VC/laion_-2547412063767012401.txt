**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject consists of three men standing on rocky coastal terrain during sunset. The central figure is slightly taller, wearing a plain black t-shirt and dark pants, standing upright with hands by his sides. To his left (viewer’s right), a man with long curly light brown hair wears a black t-shirt and dark pants, leaning slightly forward with one hand resting on a rock. To the right (viewer’s left), a man with long wavy dark hair, glasses, and a black bomber jacket over a dark shirt, stands with hands loosely at his sides; he wears faded jeans and has visible tattoos on his fingers. The background features a vivid sunset with warm orange and yellow hues near the horizon transitioning into soft pink and blue tones above. The ocean is visible in the distance with gentle waves crashing against rocks. A large rock formation appears on the far right. The sun is low, creating a lens flare effect behind the central figure's legs.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instructions explicitly transform the figures into "mythical guardians" with armor reflecting oceanic elements like coral and waves — this indicates that **the human forms, clothing, facial features, and body proportions are to be changed**, as they will be replaced by fantastical designs. The instruction specifies transforming the **background sunset into a mystical sky with vivid blues and purples**, meaning the **natural color gradient and lighting of the sunset can be altered**. The **typography** and **ocean creature motifs** are new additions not present in the original, so those are entirely new design elements.

However, the instruction does **not** state that the **positions or relative arrangement** of the figures should change — they remain “guardians” standing in a similar triangular formation. It also does **not** say to remove or alter the **rocky coastline environment**, only to enhance it conceptually. Therefore, while the **appearance** of the figures and **color palette** of the sky may change, the **spatial layout** (three figures on rocks near sea) and **basic scene structure** must still reflect the original composition.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
- Facial features and expressions of the three individuals  
- Hair texture and style (e.g., length, curl, color)  
- Clothing: replaced with mythic armor incorporating coral and wave patterns  
- Skin tone and body form (transformed into mythical beings)  
- Background sky colors: shifted from natural sunset to mystical blues and purples  
- Lighting: enhanced for dramatic effect, including lens flare modification  
- Addition of ocean creature motifs (e.g., seahorse, octopus, etc.) embedded in armor or background  
- Typography: bold serif lettering added at bottom with weathered ocean-spray texture

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
Core recognition elements must be preserved if they are essential to identifying the original image’s subjects or scene. In this case, the **original subjects are three distinct men** with specific **postures, spatial relationships, and positioning** on the rocks. While their appearances are to be transformed, the **relative positions** and **overall silhouette arrangement** (left, center, right) must remain consistent to preserve the visual logic of the scene. Changing the **spatial layout** would fundamentally alter the image’s identity.

Functional/logical association elements include the **positioning of figures relative to the sun and rocks** — the central figure is directly illuminated by the sun behind him, creating a silhouette effect. This **lighting relationship** is key to the original mood and composition. Even though the lighting will be stylized, the **sun’s position behind the central figure** must remain consistent to maintain the original framing logic.

Non-modified element deduction: After excluding allowed changes (like clothing, face, hair), the remaining **physical structure of the rocks**, **presence of the ocean**, **horizon line**, and **general silhouette of the figures** must be retained. These are not mentioned for change and are critical to maintaining coherence with the original setting. The **three-figure grouping**, **rocky foreground**, and **coastal sea backdrop** define the scene’s core identity.

Preservation Targets List:  
- Relative positions of the three figures (left, center, right)  
- Silhouette shape of each figure (especially central figure’s full upright stance)  
- Presence of rocky outcrops beneath the figures  
- Ocean visible in the background with wave motion  
- Horizon line separating sky and sea  
- Sun positioned behind the central figure, creating backlighting/silhouette effect

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The relative positions of the three figures — left, center, right — form the core compositional structure of the image. If these positions are swapped or rearranged, the visual balance and narrative of the group are lost, making it unrecognizable as the same scene. This spatial layout is essential for identification and must be preserved.
    Question: Are the three figures positioned such that one is on the left, one in the center, and one on the right from the viewer's perspective?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The central figure’s upright posture and full silhouette facing forward is a key identifier. Altering this stance (e.g., turning sideways or crouching) would disrupt the focal point of the image and misrepresent the original composition. This pose defines the dominant presence in the scene.
    Question: Is the central figure standing fully upright with both feet on the rock and facing forward?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The presence of the ocean in the background is a defining environmental feature. Removing or replacing it with land or fantasy terrain would violate the original coastal setting. The water’s presence is essential for establishing the "coastline" context required by the title.
    Question: Is the ocean visible in the background behind the figures, with waves breaking against rocks?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The rocky foreground where the figures stand is a structural anchor of the image. Replacing it with flat ground or abstract platforms would destroy the sense of location and grounding. The irregular shape and texture of the rocks are necessary for continuity.
    Question: Are the figures standing on dark, jagged rock formations in the foreground?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The sun’s placement behind the central figure creates a distinctive backlighting effect and lens flare. Moving the sun to another position or removing it would eliminate the primary light source and symbolic glow, altering the emotional tone and visual focus of the image.
    Question: Is the sun positioned directly behind the central figure, creating a bright glow between his legs?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The horizon line separates the sky and sea and provides spatial orientation. Its absence or distortion would make the scene feel disoriented or unreal. It is a foundational element of landscape composition.
    Question: Is there a clear horizon line separating the sky from the ocean in the background?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The silhouette of the figure on the right (with long hair and glasses) is visually distinct due to the combination of long hair and glasses. While details may be altered, the general shape of the head and hair must remain recognizable to preserve individual identity within the group.
    Question: Does the figure on the right have long, wavy hair extending past the shoulders?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}
{
    Q8: 
    Thinking process: The figure on the left has curly, shoulder-length hair that is visibly different from the others. Retaining this hair type helps distinguish the characters even after transformation. It is a minor but identifiable detail.
    Question: Does the figure on the left have curly, light brown hair reaching past the shoulders?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
