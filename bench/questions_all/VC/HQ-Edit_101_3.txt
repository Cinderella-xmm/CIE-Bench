**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a small, vividly yellow bird perched sideways on a dark brown tree branch. The bird faces right, with its head slightly turned toward the viewer, revealing a large, round black eye with a reflective highlight, a short, pointed dark beak, and soft, fluffy yellow plumage covering most of its body. Its wings feature distinct black stripes running through the yellow feathers, creating a bold contrast. The tail is short and yellow with subtle darker tips. The bird's legs are orange-yellow, gripping the branch firmly. Surrounding the bird are delicate pink cherry blossoms in full bloom, each flower having five rounded petals, pale pink to light rose in color, with visible yellow stamens at the center. Some flowers are fully open, while others are still in bud form. The background is softly blurred, transitioning from a warm olive-green at the top to a deeper green-gray at the bottom, providing a natural and serene atmosphere. The lighting is soft and diffused, enhancing the luminosity of the bird’s yellow feathers and the translucency of the petals.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction specifies:  
- "Convert the bird into an illustrated emblem on the box" → This means the **form** of the bird will change from a photorealistic depiction to a stylized illustration. However, it explicitly says to **keep its vibrant yellow color**, so the **color identity** must remain.  
- "Surround the bird with cherry blossom motifs from the photo" → The **cherry blossoms** are to be retained as design elements, but their **arrangement and context may be adapted** for packaging. They are not required to remain in original spatial layout or density.  
- "Apply an elegant, minimalist typographic logo at the top" → The **typography** is new content, not part of the original image; thus, no conflict.  
- "Soft pastel gradient background" → This replaces the original background, so the **original background is not preserved**.  
- No mention of retaining specific posture, size, or texture details beyond color and symbolic presence.

Thus, the **allowed changes** include:
- Transformation of the bird from realistic to illustrated form (but color must stay vibrant yellow)
- Reorganization and stylization of cherry blossoms as decorative motifs
- Replacement of background with a soft pastel gradient
- Addition of typography

However, **not allowed to change**:
- The **vibrant yellow color** of the bird (explicitly stated)
- The **presence** and **visual identity** of cherry blossoms (they must be included as motifs derived from the photo)
- The **core visual identity** of the bird (it must still be recognizable as the same species-like figure)

---

**Allowed Changes List:**  
- The bird’s form (from photorealistic to illustrated)  
- The spatial arrangement and density of cherry blossoms  
- Background (replaced with pastel gradient)  
- Addition of text/logo  
- Lighting and shadow effects (as part of artistic rendering)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
Core recognition elements:  
- The **bird’s vibrant yellow color** is explicitly instructed to be kept — this is a core identity feature. Even if stylized, the yellow must dominate.  
- The **black striped wing pattern** is a unique visual trait distinguishing this bird from others (e.g., common canary or goldfinch). While the instruction does not specify it, since it is a key identifying feature in the original image and contributes to species-specific recognition, and since it is not mentioned as being changed, it should be retained unless overridden. But note: the instruction only says “convert into an illustrated emblem” and “keep vibrant yellow,” so **stripes may be simplified**. However, due to their strong visual contrast and uniqueness, they are likely intended to be preserved in essence.  
- The **cherry blossoms’ petal shape and pink hue** are specified to be used as motifs — thus, their **form and color** must be retained in some way, even if stylized. The instruction says “motifs from the photo,” meaning they must resemble the original blooms.

Functional/logical association elements:  
- There is no functional interaction between the bird and environment (e.g., feeding), so no logical dependency.  
- However, the **position of the bird relative to the blossoms** in the original image is not required to be preserved, as the instruction allows reorganization.

Non-modified element deduction:  
- Since the bird’s **yellow color** is explicitly preserved, and **blossom motifs** are required, we infer that the **essential visual characteristics** of both must remain — including the **shape of the bird’s head, eye, beak**, and **petal structure** — because these define their identities.  
- The **texture of feathers** may be simplified in illustration, but the **fluffy appearance** and **smooth gradient of yellow** should be maintained to preserve visual fidelity.  
- The **orange-yellow feet** are minor but consistent with the bird’s overall palette; may be simplified but not altered in tone.

Thus, **elements to retain** are those that ensure the bird remains identifiable as the original yellow bird with distinctive markings, and the blossoms remain recognizable as cherry blossoms.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
- Vibrant yellow color of the bird  
- Black striped pattern on wings  
- Shape of the bird’s head and round black eye  
- Pink color and five-petal structure of cherry blossoms  
- Orange-yellow feet of the bird  
- Presence of multiple cherry blossoms surrounding the bird  

(Note: The background and exact composition are not required to be preserved.)

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The vibrant yellow color is explicitly required to be preserved in the edited version ("keeping its vibrant yellow color"). This is the primary identifier of the bird in the original image, and changing it would fundamentally alter its identity. The yellow is not just a tone but a saturated, luminous hue that makes the bird stand out against the background. Thus, preserving this color is essential for maintaining visual consistency and brand identity.
    Question: Is the bird rendered in a vibrant yellow color matching the original image?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The black striped pattern on the wings is a defining morphological feature of the bird in the original image. It distinguishes it from other yellow birds and adds visual contrast. Although the instruction allows stylization, the presence of contrasting black lines within the yellow wing area is necessary to maintain the bird’s identity. Removing or altering this pattern would make it unrecognizable.
    Question: Are there distinct black stripes visible on the bird’s wings?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The round black eye with a reflective highlight is a key facial feature that gives the bird expression and realism. In an illustrated emblem, the eye may be simplified, but its presence and shape must remain to preserve the bird’s character. Without it, the bird would lose its distinct look and become generic.
    Question: Does the bird have a clearly defined round black eye?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The cherry blossoms are required to be used as motifs in the design. Their five-petal structure and soft pink color are essential for accurate representation. Even in stylized form, the petal count and color must be retained to ensure they are recognizable as cherry blossoms. Losing this detail would break the nature-infused theme.
    Question: Are the cherry blossoms depicted with five rounded petals and a pale pink color?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The bird’s feet are orange-yellow, matching the overall color scheme and adding to its natural appearance. While not the most critical feature, their color and position contribute to the bird’s anatomical accuracy. Changing them to another color or omitting them would reduce visual coherence and make the bird appear unnatural.
    Question: Are the bird’s feet orange-yellow in color?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}

{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The bird is shown perched on a branch, which is a key contextual element in the original image. Although the branch may be stylized or removed in favor of a clean design, the instruction implies the bird is central and associated with nature. However, since the instruction does not require the branch to be present, and it may be omitted in favor of a minimalist design, this is not a required retention. But since the bird is described as perched, and the feet are gripping something, the **posture of gripping** must be preserved to show it is resting. Therefore, the **gripping pose** of the feet is important.
    Question: Are the bird’s feet positioned as if gripping a branch?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
