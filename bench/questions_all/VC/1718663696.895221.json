      "thinking_process": "The white powdered wig is a core identity feature of the historical figure depicted, especially in 18th-century portraiture. Its specific shape—curled at the sides and back, with a high forehead and voluminous back—is unique and essential for recognition. Changing its style or removing it would make the figure unidentifiable. Therefore, it is a key visual element with a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the white powdered wig with curled ends present on the figure's head?",

      "thinking_process": "The deep navy blue color of the uniform is a signature element of the historical military attire associated with the figure. It is paired with gold trim, forming a distinct visual contrast. Altering the base color would fundamentally change the identity of the outfit and disrupt historical accuracy. Thus, the color is a core recognition feature, warranting a weight of 3 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The golden staff is a central prop introduced in the edit, symbolizing the \"Flame Commander of Liberty.\" Its presence and form—especially the flame-shaped top—are crucial to the character’s identity. Removing or altering its shape would break the thematic connection. Hence, its existence and design are core to the concept, earning a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the golden staff with a flame-shaped top being held in the right hand?",

      "thinking_process": "The flame atop the staff is a functional and symbolic element representing \"Fire Mastery\" and liberty. Its appearance—dynamic, orange-yellow, with visible sparks—must be preserved to maintain the magical or heroic quality implied in the RPG context. Losing this would undermine the character’s theme. Therefore, it is a key visual element with a weight of 3 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The gold sash crossing diagonally from the right shoulder to the left hip is a structural and symbolic element of military rank and authority. Its position and color are integral to the uniform’s design. Changing its path or color would disrupt the visual balance and historical authenticity. As a major accessory, it earns a weight of 2 points.",

While not as central as the wig or uniform, it contributes to the period accuracy and completeness of the portrayal. Its absence would reduce visual coherence. It is a minor but important detail, so it receives a weight of 1 point.",
