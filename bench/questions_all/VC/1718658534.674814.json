      "thinking_process": "The spiky dorsal ridge formed by braided yarn loops is a unique structural feature that distinguishes this toy from generic pig plushies. It is a key identifier of the object’s design and serves as a core visual signature. If this ridge is removed or altered beyond recognition (e.g., replaced with smooth ceramic), the edited object would lose its identity as the original knitted toy, even if shaped like a pig. Therefore, the **presence and form** of the ridge must be preserved in the ceramic version, albeit potentially translated into engraved lines. This is a 3-point element because it is central to recognition.",
      "question": "Is the dorsal ridge composed of a series of raised, looped structures running along the back of the pig?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The tail is a distinct appendage with a specific form—a thin strand ending in a pom-pom knot. While the material may change, the **shape and attachment point** of the tail are essential for preserving the toy’s identity. In the ceramic version, the tail must retain its curved path and terminal fluffiness, even if rendered differently. Losing this would alter the silhouette significantly. This is a 2-point element because it contributes strongly to the object’s recognizable form but is secondary to the ridge.",
      "question": "Does the tail extend from the rear of the pig and terminate in a fluffy pom-pom?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The pig has four short legs positioned symmetrically under the body. Their placement and relative size are crucial to maintaining the correct posture and balance of the figure. Changing their number, length, or position would distort the form. Although the instruction allows material change, the **leg count and spatial arrangement** must remain intact. This is a 2-point element because it affects structural integrity and identification.",
      "question": "Are there four short legs attached beneath the body, two on each side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The snout is a prominent feature at the front of the pig, defined by a rounded protrusion with a slight indentation for the nose. Its shape is key to identifying the animal as a pig rather than another creature. Even if made of ceramic, the **snout’s convex shape and forward projection** must be preserved. This is a 3-point element because it is a core facial feature essential for species recognition.",
      "question": "Is there a rounded snout extending forward from the face of the pig?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The ears are small, upright, and located on top of the head. They are part of the pig’s facial anatomy and contribute to its cartoonish, stylized appearance. Though small, their **position and shape** are important for maintaining consistency with the original design. If omitted or moved, the face would appear incomplete. This is a 1-point element because it is a minor detail but still aids in visual fidelity.",
      "question": "Are there two small, upright ears positioned on the top of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
