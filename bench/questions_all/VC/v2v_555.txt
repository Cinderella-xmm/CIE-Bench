Description of reference image: The subject consists of two cups of coffee with latte art depicting the Colosseum and Big Ben. Both cups are white, placed on matching saucers, and rest on a wooden table. The latte art is detailed, showing the iconic structures in brown tones against the creamy background of the coffee foam. The background is simple, focusing solely on the cups and their contents.

Thinking process: First, analyze the instructions that clearly state what can be changed, such as transforming the latte art into a snow globe design. This involves changing the form of the latte art while retaining the iconic symbols (Colosseum and Big Ben). The scene's background can be replaced with a softly blurred café atmosphere, and lighting adjustments are allowed to create a warm glow. Quantity, proportion, and angle changes are not specified, so these should remain consistent.

Allowed Changes List:
Specific element 1 that allows for changes
- Latte art form (transformed into a snow globe design)
- Scene environment and background elements (replaced with a cozy café atmosphere)
- Lighting adjustments (to create a warm, gentle glow)

Step 2- Determine the elements that should remain unchanged

Thinking process:
Core recognition elements: The iconic symbols of the Colosseum and Big Ben must be retained as they are key identifiers. Their shapes and details should remain recognizable within the new snow globe design.
Functional/logical association elements: The relationship between the two structures (one cup per structure) should be maintained to preserve logical consistency.
Non modified element deduction: Details like the color scheme of the latte art (brown tones), the white cups and saucers, and the wooden table surface should be retained for visual coherence.

Preservation Targets List:​
(Element 1 that should be maintained): Iconic symbols of the Colosseum and Big Ben
(Element 2 that should be maintained): Shape and details of the structures within the latte art
(Element 3 that should be maintained): White cups and saucers
(Element 4 that should be maintained): Wooden table surface

Q1: 
Thinking process: The iconic symbols of the Colosseum and Big Ben are core identity features. Losing these would make the image unrecognizable. The question focuses on whether these symbols are still present in the edited image.
Question: Are the Colosseum and Big Ben still recognizable as iconic symbols within the snow globe design?
Choices: yes, no
A: yes
Weight: 3

Q2: 
Thinking process: The shape and details of the structures are important for maintaining the identity of the latte art. These should be preserved even in the new design.
Question: Do the shapes and details of the Colosseum and Big Ben remain intact within the snow globe depiction?
Choices: yes, no
A: yes
Weight: 2

Q3: 
Thinking process: The white cups and saucers are part of the original setting and contribute to the overall scene. They should be retained for visual consistency.
Question: Are the white cups and saucers still present in the edited image?
Choices: yes, no
A: yes
Weight: 2

Q4: 
Thinking process: The wooden table surface provides context and grounding for the scene. It should be retained to maintain visual coherence.
Question: Is the wooden table surface still visible in the edited image?
Choices: yes, no
A: yes
Weight: 1

Q5: 
Thinking process: The brown tones of the latte art are a unique detail that helps identify the original image. Retaining this color scheme is important for consistency.
Question: Are the brown tones of the latte art preserved in the snow globe design?
Choices: yes, no
A: yes
