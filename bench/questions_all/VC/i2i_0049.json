The text \"START\" is an iconic symbol for the event's beginning and must remain unchanged. Losing this text would make it unclear what event is taking place. Therefore, the presence of this text is a key element with high weight.",

      "thinking_process": "The skier's posture, specifically holding ski poles and wearing skiing gear, is essential as it defines their activity. Without these elements, the image would lose significant context regarding the activity. The correct posture and equipment are logically associated with skiing events and form a core function.",

While it is not a core element, it is an important accessory that helps maintain the context and authenticity of the event. Removing or altering this detail would detract from the overall consistency.",

These elements support the logical narrative that the skier is participating in a skiing event, thus they should be retained for scene integrity.",

      "thinking_process": "The skier's position relative to the starting line, including their forward-leaning posture, is a functional element that captures the moment before commencement of the race. This posture reflects readiness and is pivotal to the context of the image. Altering this posture would disrupt the visual narrative and diminish the coherence of the scene.",
