**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

Description of reference image:  
The subject is a vintage green steam locomotive numbered "1902," with a black front, red buffer beam, and gold detailing, emitting a large plume of white smoke. The train travels along a curved track through a pastoral countryside landscape featuring patchwork fields in shades of yellow, green, and brown, bordered by stone walls and hedgerows. In the background, modern wind turbines stand atop a hill, creating a juxtaposition between old and new technology. To the right of the track, a small stone railway station building with a moss-covered roof shelters several people dressed in early 20th-century attire—men in suits and hats, women in long dresses and bonnets—sitting on benches or standing near luggage. Luggage trunks are placed on the platform, and the entire scene is bathed in bright daylight under a blue sky with fluffy clouds.

Thinking process:  
The editing instruction explicitly states to transform the scene into a **vibrant puzzle scenery**, where:
- The **steam train** becomes **large colorful blocks**
- The **smoke** becomes **swirling white forms**
- The **landscape** becomes **geometric designs**
- The **people** are replaced with **smaller puzzle pieces depicting vintage attire**
- The **entire scene** is positioned on a **light wooden tabletop**

This means that the **form and structure** of the original elements (train, people, landscape) can be changed dramatically. However, the **identity** of these elements must still be recognizable through their transformed versions—especially if they are to remain faithful to the original concept.

Allowed Changes List:  
- Form and structure of the steam locomotive (can become block-like puzzle shapes)  
- Shape and texture of the smoke (can become abstract swirling patterns)  
- Landscape composition (fields, hills, trees can become geometric patterns)  
- People (can be replaced with puzzle pieces showing vintage clothing)  
- Background elements (wind turbines, buildings, etc., can be stylized or reimagined as puzzle components)  
- Overall scene setting (can be repositioned onto a wooden tabletop)  
- Color palette (can be made more vibrant and playful)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements:  
- The **number "1902"** on the front of the locomotive is a key identifier for the specific train model. It is visually prominent and central to the identity of this particular engine. Even in a puzzle transformation, its presence should be preserved to maintain recognition of the train’s identity.
- The **green color of the locomotive body** is distinctive and contributes to its visual signature. While colors may be altered for vibrancy, the core color association should not be lost entirely.
- The **presence of the wind turbines** in the distant background is an intentional contrast between historical and modern technology. Their symbolic role suggests they should be retained in some form, even if stylized.
- The **stone railway station building** with its moss-covered roof and arched doorway is a unique architectural feature that anchors the scene. Its structural outline and material texture (stone, moss) should be preserved in essence, even if converted into puzzle form.
- The **luggage trunks** on the platform are functional props indicating travel; their presence supports narrative coherence and should be retained in transformed form.

Functional/logical association elements:  
- The **relationship between the train and the track** must remain logical: the train must still appear to be moving along the rails, even if both are now puzzle pieces. Disrupting this spatial logic would break the scene's realism.
- The **positioning of passengers relative to the station**—some seated, some standing, some with luggage—must reflect the original layout to preserve narrative context.
- The **relative placement of the wind turbines on the hilltop** must remain consistent with the original scene’s geography to avoid confusion about scale and perspective.

Non-modified element deduction:  
After excluding all allowed changes (forms, colors, textures, materials), the following visual features must remain intact:
- The **number "1902"** on the locomotive
- The **green body of the locomotive**
- The **stone texture of the station building**
- The **moss on the roof**
- The **presence of luggage trunks**
- The **wind turbines on the hill**
- The **curved track layout**
- The **platform area with benches**
- The **clothing styles of the figures** (even if represented as puzzle pieces)

These are not just decorative—they are essential for maintaining the identity of the scene and ensuring continuity between the original and edited versions.

Preservation Targets List:  
- The number "1902" on the front of the locomotive  
- The green color of the locomotive body  
- The stone construction of the station building  
- The moss-covered roof of the station  
- The presence of luggage trunks on the platform  
- The wind turbines on the hilltop  
- The curved railway track  
- The platform benches and their arrangement  
- The vintage clothing styles of the figures (in terms of silhouette and detail)

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The number "1902" is the primary identifier of the locomotive and a core visual element that distinguishes it from other trains. Its loss would make the train unrecognizable as the specific model depicted. This is a critical identity marker, hence assigned 3 points.
    Question: Is the number "1902" clearly visible on the front of the locomotive?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The green color of the locomotive body is a defining characteristic that sets it apart from other trains. While the edit allows for color enhancement, the base green hue must remain to preserve recognition. Changing it entirely would alter the train’s identity.
    Question: Does the locomotive retain a dominant green color on its body?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The stone texture of the station building is a key architectural detail that grounds the scene in a rural British setting. Even if stylized, the material appearance must be preserved to maintain authenticity and visual coherence.
    Question: Is the station building constructed from stone material with visible texture?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The moss on the roof is a minor but distinctive environmental detail that adds character and realism to the station. Its presence reinforces the aged, natural setting. While not core, its absence would reduce visual fidelity.
    Question: Is there moss growing on the roof of the station building?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}

{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The luggage trunks are functional objects that support the narrative of travelers waiting at the station. Their presence is essential for contextual accuracy and must be preserved even if transformed into puzzle pieces.
    Question: Are there luggage trunks present on the platform near the passengers?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The wind turbines on the hilltop serve as a symbolic contrast between past and future technologies. Their location and form must be retained to preserve the intended thematic message of the image.
    Question: Are wind turbines visible on the hilltop in the background?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The curved railway track defines the path of the train and creates depth in the composition. Its shape must be maintained to preserve spatial logic and continuity of motion.
    Question: Is the railway track visibly curved as it extends into the distance?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q8: 
    Thinking process: The platform benches are key elements of the station infrastructure. Their arrangement and presence support the social aspect of the scene and must be retained in form, even if stylized.
    Question: Are there wooden benches on the platform where passengers are seated?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}

{
    Q9: 
    Thinking process: The clothing styles of the figures—such as top hats, long dresses, and waistcoats—are essential for identifying the time period. Even if rendered as puzzle pieces, the silhouettes and details of vintage attire must be preserved.
    Question: Do the figures on the platform wear clothing consistent with early 20th-century fashion (e.g., top hats, long dresses)?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
