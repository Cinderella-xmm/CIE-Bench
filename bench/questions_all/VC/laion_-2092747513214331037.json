      "thinking_process": "The cyclist's aerodynamic posture—specifically leaning forward with hands gripping the aerobars—is the defining action of a time trial rider. This pose is essential for identifying the activity as a time trial rather than a casual ride or sprint. Altering it would fundamentally misrepresent the scene. It is a core identification feature, hence weighted 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the cyclist in a forward-leaning position with hands on aerobars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The support car with two bicycles mounted vertically on the roof rack is a distinctive feature indicating team support in competitive cycling. Its presence defines the context of professional racing. Removing or changing this configuration would disrupt the narrative logic of the scene. This is a key functional element, thus weighted 3 points.",
      "question": "Are two bicycles mounted vertically on the roof rack of the black car?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The road markings—white edge lines and yellow center line—are essential for establishing the setting as a structured roadway suitable for a time trial. Their absence or distortion would make the location ambiguous. While color may be enhanced, their structural presence must remain. This is an important scene element, so weighted 2 points.",
      "question": "Are there white lane markings and a yellow center line on the road?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The orange traffic cone in the background serves as a visual cue for course demarcation, reinforcing the idea of a controlled race environment. Though small, its presence contributes to scene logic. It is not central but helps maintain environmental coherence. Therefore, it is a secondary detail, weighted 1 point.",
      "question": "Is there an orange traffic cone visible in the background near the cyclist?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The license plate \"BOC-480\" is a specific identifier on the car. While not visually dominant, it provides authenticity and anchors the image to reality. Replacing it without reason would reduce fidelity. As a minor but verifiable detail, it is retained unless explicitly changed. Thus, it is a detail-level element, weighted 1 point.",
      "question": "Does the car have a license plate reading \"BOC-480\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The relative positioning of the cyclist and car—parallel, close proximity, with the car slightly ahead or alongside—establishes the dynamic of support during a race. Changing this could imply pursuit or obstruction, altering the intended narrative. This spatial relationship is crucial for logical consistency, making it a key scene element, weighted 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the cyclist riding parallel to the car on the same road?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The arid, hilly landscape with sparse vegetation provides environmental context for the location. While lighting and color may shift with the futuristic theme, the basic terrain shape and lack of greenery must remain to preserve geographical plausibility. This is a background feature contributing to scene coherence, so it is weighted 1 point.",
      "question": "Is the background composed of dry hills with sparse vegetation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
