Its presence beneath the beak is crucial for species identification. Even if exaggerated in a cartoon style, its location and basic form must remain to preserve the pelican’s identity. Losing this would make the bird unrecognizable as a pelican. Hence, it is a core identity element.",
      "question": "Is there a visible gular pouch located beneath the lower mandible of the beak?",

      "thinking_process": "Webbed feet with visible claws are key identifiers of aquatic birds and are essential for confirming the pelican’s natural biology. Though the style may change, the presence of webbing and claw structure must remain to maintain biological accuracy within the stylized version. Their absence would suggest a non-bird or land-based creature, undermining authenticity.",

      "thinking_process": "The instruction explicitly requires maintaining the original texture. The layered, striated feather pattern is a unique visual trait of real pelicans and contributes to their realistic appearance. Even with pastel colors, the underlying texture must be preserved to honor the original image’s detail and fulfill the edit’s requirement. Losing this would result in a smooth or flat-feathered bird, altering its fundamental look.",
      "question": "Are the feathers on the body composed of layered, striated structures with visible individual feather shafts and overlapping edges?",

While proportions may be exaggerated, the general shape must remain consistent to avoid misidentification. This silhouette is a core structural feature that supports recognition.",
      "question": "Does the bird have a long neck curving down from the head to a broad, rounded body?",

      "thinking_process": "The standing posture with legs positioned directly beneath the body is a natural stance for pelicans and contributes to spatial logic. Changing this could imply an unnatural pose or floating state, disrupting the sense of balance and realism. While the style may be cartoonish, the basic weight distribution must remain.",
      "question": "Are both legs positioned under the body, supporting the pelican in a grounded standing pose?",

      "thinking_process": "The eye is a key facial feature, though the instruction allows bulging. However, the **presence** of a single dark, round eye must remain—even if enlarged—to retain facial structure. Removing or replacing it entirely (e.g., with a cartoon dot) would violate biological consistency unless specified. Since the instruction does not remove it, it must be preserved.",
