**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a bearded blacksmith in a stone-walled forge, wearing a white turban wrapped around his head and a brown leather apron over a long-sleeved gray tunic. He is positioned slightly to the left of center, leaning forward with intense focus as he hammers a glowing red-hot metal piece on an anvil. His right hand grips a large hammer with a wooden handle and iron head, while his left holds a long metal rod (tongs) to manipulate the heated metal. The anvil rests on a circular wooden stump, surrounded by scattered metal fragments and tools like a chisel and small hammer. Behind him, another figure in similar attire stands near a blazing furnace built into a stone archway, holding a tool and observing. The forge features arched stone doorways, hanging oil lamps emitting warm yellow light, and walls lined with various tools and metalwork patterns. The background has a cool blue glow emanating from behind the arches, contrasting with the fiery orange-red glow of the furnace and molten metal. The overall atmosphere is one of ancient craftsmanship within a medieval or fantasy-style workshop.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction specifies a transformation into a **Middle Ages illuminated manuscript page**, which implies a complete stylistic overhaul: the scene must be rendered in a flat, decorative, symbolic style typical of medieval manuscripts, including gold leaf, ornate borders, and stylized figures. The central figure is to be reimagined as a **saintly blacksmith** with a **golden halo**, wearing **flowing medieval robes** rather than practical clothing. His tools are to become **divine instruments**, suggesting symbolic transformation (e.g., hammer becomes a sacred mallet). The **forge is to be ethereal**, with glowing embers and **entwining vine borders**, and the **edges inscribed with ornate calligraphy**.

Key changes explicitly allowed:
- **Transformation of the central figure**: From a realistic blacksmith to a saintly figure → change in appearance, clothing, and symbolism.
- **Change in tools**: From functional blacksmithing tools (hammer, tongs) to divine instruments → form and function altered.
- **Forge environment**: Transformed into an ethereal furnace with glowing embers and vine borders → visual style and composition changed.
- **Scene framing**: Edges to be adorned with ornate calligraphy and vine borders → new structural elements added.
- **Style shift**: From photorealistic to illuminated manuscript → entire rendering technique changed.

Thus, **allowed changes include**:
- The **clothing** of the central figure (from apron and tunic to flowing robes).
- The **tools** (hammer and tongs → divine instruments).
- The **appearance of the forge** (realistic fire → ethereal glow).
- The **overall artistic style** (photorealism → manuscript illumination).
- The **addition of borders and calligraphy** around the scene.
- The **introduction of a golden halo** around the central figure.

**Allowed Changes List:**
- The clothing style and material of the central figure
- The form and function of the hammer and tongs
- The visual representation of the forge and fire
- The presence and design of the golden halo
- The addition of vine borders and calligraphic text
- The overall artistic rendering style (from realism to manuscript)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
We now exclude all elements that are explicitly allowed to change, and retain only those that are either **core identity features** or **functionally/logically essential** to the original image’s structure and coherence.

**Core recognition elements:**  
While the figure is being transformed into a saint, the **original identity of the blacksmith at work** remains foundational. The **act of forging metal on an anvil** is central to the scene’s narrative. Even if the tools are divine, the **action of hammering a hot metal object on an anvil** must remain recognizable — this is the core functional logic of the scene. Without it, the scene loses its purpose.

Additionally, **the anvil itself** is a key object — its shape (blocky, with a pointed horn), position (on a wooden stump), and role (supporting the metal) are critical. Though its appearance may be stylized, its **iconic silhouette and placement** must be preserved for recognition.

**Functional/logical association elements:**  
The **relationship between the hammer, tongs, and metal** is essential. The hammer must still strike the metal, and the tongs must hold it — even if transformed into divine instruments, their **functional roles must remain**. Otherwise, the action becomes nonsensical.

The **position of the anvil on a wooden stump** is also logical — it provides stability. This spatial relationship should be retained.

**Non-modified element deduction:**  
Other elements not mentioned in the instructions for change must be retained unless they conflict with the new style. However, since the instruction mandates a full transformation into a manuscript style, **only the core functional and structural elements** need to be preserved in their **essential form**.

Therefore, the following must be retained:
- The **presence of the anvil** and its **distinctive shape** (rectangular base with a pointed end)
- The **act of hammering a glowing metal object** on the anvil
- The **use of tongs to hold the metal**
- The **wooden stump supporting the anvil**
- The **basic layout of the forge** (stone walls, furnace, second figure in background)
- The **relative positions** of the blacksmith, anvil, and furnace

These are not merely details — they define the **scene’s identity** as a blacksmith at work. Even in a stylized form, their **visual essence** must persist.

**Preservation Targets List:**
- The anvil's distinctive blocky shape with a pointed horn
- The glowing metal object being hammered
- The hammer striking the metal
- The use of tongs to hold the metal
- The wooden stump beneath the anvil
- The stone furnace in the background
- The second blacksmith figure standing near the furnace
- The arched stone architecture of the forge
- The relative positioning of the central figure, anvil, and furnace

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The anvil is a core functional object in the scene, uniquely defined by its blocky rectangular base and elongated pointed horn. Its shape is iconic and necessary for identifying the activity as blacksmithing. Even if stylized, its fundamental silhouette must remain intact to preserve the scene’s identity. Losing this would make the scene unrecognizable as a forge. Therefore, this is a 3-point core element.
    Question: Is the anvil present with a blocky rectangular base and a pointed horn?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The glowing metal object on the anvil is the focal point of the action. Its luminous red-orange color and placement directly on the anvil surface indicate it is being forged. This is a key functional element — without it, the hammering action lacks purpose. Its presence and position are essential to the scene’s logic. Thus, it is a 3-point core element.
    Question: Is there a glowing red-orange metal object resting on the anvil?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The hammer is actively striking the metal, and its motion is central to the scene. Even if transformed into a divine instrument, the act of hammering must be visually preserved. The hammer must be depicted in contact with or about to strike the metal. This is a functional action element critical to the narrative. Therefore, it is a 2-point important element.
    Question: Is the hammer positioned above or in contact with the glowing metal on the anvil?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The tongs are used to hold the hot metal, and their presence is essential for the action to make sense. They must be visible in the blacksmith’s hand, gripping the metal. Even if stylized, their functional role must be clear. This is a 2-point important accessory element.
    Question: Are tongs visible in the blacksmith’s left hand, holding the glowing metal?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The wooden stump supports the anvil and is a minor but consistent environmental detail. It grounds the anvil in the scene and contributes to the workshop setting. While not core, its absence would disrupt visual coherence. Thus, it is a 1-point detail element.
    Question: Is the anvil placed on a circular wooden stump?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The stone furnace in the background emits light and heat, providing context for the forge. Its arched opening and glowing interior are key to the environment. Even if stylized, its presence and location must be retained to maintain scene logic. This is a 2-point important scene element.
    Question: Is there a stone furnace with a glowing interior visible in the background to the right?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The second blacksmith figure in the background adds depth and context to the scene. His presence near the furnace suggests a working forge. Even if stylized, his position and general form must be preserved to maintain the scene’s narrative. This is a 1-point detail element.
    Question: Is there a second figure in similar attire standing near the furnace in the background?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}
{
    Q8: 
    Thinking process: The arched stone architecture defines the setting as a medieval forge. The arches and stonework are characteristic of the environment. Their preservation ensures the scene remains grounded in the original setting. This is a 2-point important scene element.
    Question: Are there arched stone doorways visible in the background?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
