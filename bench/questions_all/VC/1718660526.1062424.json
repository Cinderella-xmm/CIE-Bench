      "thinking_process": "The striped pattern (orange with black stripes) is the defining visual trait of the subject, distinguishing it from other animals or toys. Even though the material changes, the stripe configuration — including spacing, direction, and coverage — must be preserved to maintain identity. Loss of this pattern would fundamentally alter recognition of the animal.",
      "question": "Are the black stripes evenly distributed across the body, head, and legs in the same pattern as the original knitted animal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The snout with two dark circular nostrils is a core facial feature that defines the animal’s species-like morphology. The instruction specifically requires retaining the snout with precisely cut tiles, so its shape and position must remain identical. Altering the snout would break the visual logic of the transformation.",
      "question": "Is the snout present with two clearly defined, dark circular nostrils positioned symmetrically on the upper portion of the snout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The large round eyes with white sclera and black pupils are central to the animal’s expressive character. They are explicitly mentioned as needing precise tile recreation, meaning their size, shape, and placement must be preserved. Their loss would destroy the emotional appeal and identity of the figure.",
      "question": "Are the eyes large, round, and positioned symmetrically on the face, each consisting of a white outer ring and a central black pupil?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The mouth shape — a gentle upward curve forming a smile — contributes to the character’s friendly expression. Though not a structural component, it is a key detail for emotional recognition. Since the instruction retains \"expressive facial features,\" the mouth must remain intact in form and position.",
      "question": "Is the mouth a clearly visible curved line forming a smile below the snout, consistent with the original animal’s expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The four-legged stance with one front leg forward conveys motion and balance. This posture is integral to the subject’s dynamic presence. Changing limb positions would disrupt the sense of movement and misrepresent the original pose.",
      "question": "Is the animal in a walking pose with the left front leg extended forward and the right front leg grounded behind it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The small rounded ears on top of the head are distinctive anatomical markers. Their shape and position contribute to the overall silhouette. Although not central to identity like stripes or eyes, they are part of the original design and must be preserved for visual coherence.",
      "question": "Are there two small, rounded ears positioned symmetrically on top of the head, pointing slightly outward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The sandy textured platform serves as the immediate ground surface and is explicitly required by the instruction. Retaining its rough, granular texture contrasts with the smooth tiles and maintains environmental logic. While the broader beach may be removed, the platform must preserve the tactile quality of sand.",
      "question": "Is the sculpture placed on a surface with a visibly granular, uneven texture resembling natural sand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
