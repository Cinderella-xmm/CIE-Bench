Description of reference image: The subject is a man standing in front of a bookshelf, wearing a black jacket over a black T-shirt with a white graphic design in the center. His hair is short and styled neatly, and he has a friendly smile. Behind him is a beige wall with a shelf holding books – some are blue and some are red. To the right, there’s a golden decorative item.

### Step 1 - Allowed Changes List
Thinking process: The instructions specify enlarging the head, cartoonifying the body, and placing the figure on a bookshelf. This implies allowed changes include:
- Enlarging the head while keeping facial features recognizable.
- Cartoonification of the body while changing its proportions.
- Placement of the bobblehead figure on a bookshelf, replacing the current background partially or entirely.
- Adjusting the position to fit the bookshelf setting.

Allowed Changes List:
Specific element 1 that allows for changes: Head size enlargement.
Specific element 2 that allows for changes: Cartoonification of body parts.
Specific element 3 that allows for changes: Background placement adjustment.

### Step 2 - Preservation Targets List
Thinking process: 
- Core recognition elements (e.g., the man's facial features, expression, and hairstyle) must remain to maintain his identity.
- Functional/logical association elements: The positioning of the subject relative to the bookshelf should be retained if possible, as per the instruction to place the bobblehead on it.
- Remaining elements for visual coherence: The shirt design and color are recognizable and should be preserved even in the cartoonified body.

Preservation Targets List:
(Element 1 that should be maintained: Facial features and expression)
(Element 2 that should be maintained: Distinctive hairstyle)
(Element 3 that should be maintained: Black T-shirt design)
