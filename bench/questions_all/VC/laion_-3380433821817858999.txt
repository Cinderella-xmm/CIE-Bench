Description of reference image: The subject is a collectible figurine of Vegeta from the *Dragon Ball* series, depicted in his Super Saiyan Blue form. He is captured mid-air in a dynamic pose, with both arms raised above his head and legs bent backward as if executing a powerful jump or attack. His hair is spiky and light blue, consistent with the Super Saiyan Blue transformation. He wears a blue bodysuit with white gloves and boots, a white armored chest plate with yellow accents on the sides, and a yellow collar around the neck. His facial expression is fierce, with an open mouth showing aggression and intense eyes. The figure is mounted on a simple black circular base via a central vertical pole, which supports the floating posture. The background is plain white, emphasizing the figure without distraction.

Thinking process:  
First, analyze the editing instructions: they explicitly state transforming the figure into an **anime-style tutorial infographic** titled “Master the Power Jump,” featuring **three illustrated steps** with **dynamic illustrations**, **bold outlines**, **vibrant colors (blues and whites)**, and **energetic fonts**. This indicates that the **original figurine's physical form will be replaced or reinterpreted** into a **step-by-step visual guide**, meaning the **figurine itself is no longer the primary subject** but a **source for character design and pose inspiration**.

The instruction allows for:
- Replacing the current static figure with **illustrated step-by-step poses**
- Changing the **format** from a 3D figurine to a **2D infographic**
- Introducing **new elements**: captions, numbered steps, text boxes, and instructional layout
- Using **different artistic style** (anime-style with bold lines and vibrant colors)
- Modifying **posture** to represent different stages of the jump

However, the instruction does **not** specify changes to:
- The **core identity of the character** (Vegeta)
- The **key visual traits** defining Vegeta’s Super Saiyan Blue form
- The **essential action sequence** implied by the original pose (a power jump)

Thus, while the **form** and **presentation** are allowed to change, the **character identity**, **iconic appearance**, and **action logic** must remain intact to maintain coherence and recognition.

Allowed Changes List:  
- The 3D figurine format → can be changed to 2D infographic  
- The base and stand → can be removed or redesigned  
- The background → can be changed to include instructional panels  
- The overall composition → can be transformed into a multi-panel tutorial  
- The color palette → can be enhanced with vibrancy, though blues and whites should dominate  
- The pose → can be broken down into sequential steps  

Step 2 - Determine the elements that should remain unchanged  

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements:  
Vegeta is a well-known character from *Dragon Ball*, and his **Super Saiyan Blue form** is iconic. Key features include:
- **Light blue spiky hair** – essential for identifying the transformation
- **Blue bodysuit with white armor and yellow accents** – signature outfit
- **Fierce facial expression with open mouth and intense eyes** – characteristic of battle-ready state
- **Muscular build and athletic proportions** – core to the character’s design

These are **non-negotiable identity markers**; changing them would result in a different character or transformation level.

Functional/logical association elements:  
The **pose** represents a **powerful jump**, likely the "Galick Gun" or similar aerial attack. The **mid-air posture** with arms raised and legs tucked implies **kinetic energy and momentum**. The **sequence of motion** described in the instructions (kneeling → leap → tuck) must logically stem from the original pose. Thus, the **motion logic** must be preserved, even if broken into steps.

Non-modified element deduction:  
Although the **figurine’s base and support structure** are not critical to the character’s identity, they are **part of the original object** and may be retained visually in the infographic as part of the context. However, since the instruction allows for full transformation, their retention is optional. But **any representation of Vegeta must retain his defining visual traits**.

Preservation Targets List:  
- Light blue spiky hair  
- Blue bodysuit with white chest armor and yellow side panels  
- White gloves and boots with yellow tips  
- Fierce facial expression with open mouth and sharp eyes  
- Muscular physique and dynamic mid-air pose  
- Character identity as Vegeta in Super Saiyan Blue form

    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The light blue spiky hair is the most distinctive feature of Vegeta’s Super Saiyan Blue transformation. It is a core identity marker that distinguishes him from other forms (like Super Saiyan God or base form). Without this specific hair color and style, the character would not be recognizable as Super Saiyan Blue Vegeta. Therefore, its presence and color must be preserved.
    Question: Is the character depicted with light blue spiky hair?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The blue bodysuit with white chest armor and yellow side panels is Vegeta’s signature outfit. This combination is unique to his design and is crucial for identification. Any deviation in color or pattern would misrepresent the character.

    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The white gloves and boots with yellow tips are part of Vegeta’s standard attire and contribute to his visual consistency across media. These details are minor but help maintain authenticity. Their absence would reduce visual fidelity.
    Question: Are the gloves and boots white with yellow tips at the fingers and toes?

    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The fierce facial expression with an open mouth and intense eyes is characteristic of Vegeta during battle. This expression conveys aggression and power, essential to his persona. Losing it would make the character appear passive or unrecognizable.

    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The muscular build and dynamic mid-air pose are central to the action being depicted. The pose suggests a powerful jump, which aligns with the tutorial’s theme. Preserving the anatomical structure and movement ensures the tutorial remains grounded in the original action.
    Question: Is the character shown in a dynamic mid-air pose with arms raised and legs bent backward?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The character’s identity as Vegeta is fundamental. Even if stylized, the face shape, hairstyle, and outfit must clearly indicate he is Vegeta. Misidentifying the character undermines the entire purpose of the tutorial.
    Question: Is the character clearly identifiable as Vegeta from Dragon Ball?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
