**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a male basketball player captured in a dynamic low crouch, dribbling a basketball with his right hand. He has short, bleached blonde hair and a light beard. He wears a royal blue sleeveless jersey with black trim, matching blue shorts, black knee pads on both knees, black socks, and high-top basketball shoes with black uppers, blue midsoles, and orange soles. His posture shows forward momentum: left leg extended back, right leg bent under him, body leaning slightly forward, eyes focused ahead. The background features an outdoor urban basketball court with a bright blue surface marked with white lines. Behind the player is a chain-link fence covered in vibrant graffiti art featuring large stylized letters in purple, teal, yellow, pink, and magenta, with splatter effects and sharp outlines. A standard basketball hoop with a red rim and white net is visible above the graffiti wall. The building behind the wall has gray concrete walls with windows and air conditioning units.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction specifies:  
- "Depict the basketball player in a **stylized cartoon form** with **exaggerated movements and dynamic muscles**" → This allows for transformation of the subject’s form, proportions, and anatomy into a cartoon style. Therefore, **the realistic human anatomy, facial features, and natural proportions** are allowed to change.  
- "Adjust colors to bold neons reflecting the backdrop graffiti" → The color palette of the subject (especially clothing, skin, hair) can be altered to match neon tones (e.g., electric blue, hot pink, lime green), but **only if such changes align with the original visual elements**—i.e., the **original color scheme of the jersey and shoes remains as a base**, even if intensified.  
- "Include a **blank graffiti-style text area on the side for custom messages**" → This introduces a **new element not present in the original image**, so it is not part of retention. However, the **presence of graffiti** must remain consistent with the theme.  
- "Enhance street art vibrance" → Suggests amplification of existing graffiti elements, but does **not require removal or replacement** of the graffiti backdrop. Thus, **the graffiti wall itself should be preserved**, though its style may be exaggerated or stylized.

From this, we extract:

**Allowed Changes List:**  
- Subject’s physical form (proportions, muscle definition, pose exaggeration) — allowed to become cartoonish and dynamic  
- Color scheme of the subject (clothing, skin, hair) — allowed to shift toward neon hues based on graffiti  
- Addition of a blank graffiti-style text area — new element, not required to be retained  
- Stylization of graffiti background — allowed to be more vivid or abstract, but **must retain core graffiti presence and layout**  
- Artistic rendering style — allowed to shift from photorealism to cartoon

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
We now exclude the allowed changes and determine what **must remain** based on identity, function, and visual coherence.

**Core recognition elements:**  
- The **basketball player's action** (dribbling) is central to the scene. Even if stylized, the **act of holding and bouncing the ball** must remain intact because it defines the context and purpose of the image.  
- The **basketball itself** is a functional object essential to the scene. Its **presence and spherical shape** must be preserved, even if color or texture is changed.  
- The **blue jersey and matching shorts** are key identifiers of the player’s outfit. While color may shift to neon, the **color contrast between blue and black trim** and the **overall silhouette of the uniform** must remain recognizable.  
- The **knee pads** are distinctive protective gear; their **placement and black color** are important for identifying the player’s equipment and sport context.  
- The **shoes** have a distinct design: black upper, blue midsole, orange sole. This **three-color combination and high-top structure** are unique identifiers. Though color may shift, the **basic structure and position** must remain.  
- The **graffiti wall** is not just background—it is a thematic anchor. Its **presence, location behind the player, and general layout** must be retained to preserve the urban/street art context. Even if stylized, the **wall must remain in the same spatial relationship** to the player and hoop.

**Functional/logical association elements:**  
- The **player’s interaction with the basketball** (right-hand grip, ball near ground) is critical. Changing this would break the logical action of dribbling.  
- The **hoop and backboard** must remain in place because they define the basketball setting. Their **position above the graffiti wall and behind the player** is essential for scene logic.  
- The **court markings** (white lines on blue surface) provide spatial context. While not focal, they support the authenticity of the environment and should remain visible.

**Non-modified element deduction:**  
After removing allowed changes (cartoon form, neon colors, added text box), the remaining elements that exist in the original and are not permitted to be changed include:  
- The **presence of the basketball**  
- The **player’s stance** (low crouch, legs apart, forward lean)  
- The **relative positions** of the player, ball, hoop, and graffiti  
- The **structure of the hoop and net**  
- The **texture and pattern of the court surface** (though may be stylized, basic layout must stay)

Thus, these are the **preservation targets**.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
- The basketball (present, spherical, held in right hand)  
- The player’s low-dribble stance (crouched, right leg bent, left leg extended)  
- The blue jersey with black trim and matching shorts  
- The black knee pads on both knees  
- The high-top basketball shoes with black upper, blue midsole, orange sole  
- The graffiti-covered wall behind the player  
- The basketball hoop with red rim and white net  
- The court surface with blue base and white lines

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

Q1:  
Thinking process: The basketball is a core functional object in the image. Its presence and spherical shape are essential to identify the activity as basketball. Even if stylized, its **shape and location in the player’s hand** must remain. Losing it would make the scene unrecognizable as a basketball scene. This is a **core identity feature** with weight 3.  
Question: Is the basketball present and being held in the player’s right hand?  
Choices: Yes, No
