      "thinking_process": "The golden tufted grasses are distinctive desert flora present in the original image, arranged in clusters around the base of the cactus. Their spherical, spiky form and golden-brown color are key identifiers of the specific desert ecosystem depicted. If these are removed or replaced, the environmental authenticity and ecological context of the original image are lost, undermining visual consistency. Since the instruction does not allow replacing the flora, their presence is essential for maintaining the desert setting. This is a core environmental feature tied to the scene’s identity, thus warranting a weight of 3 points.",

They contrast with the golden grasses and contribute to the biodiversity of the scene. These plants are not mentioned in the editing instructions as being removable or transformable, and their removal would alter the ecological balance of the foreground. As an important secondary plant element contributing to scene coherence, their retention ensures fidelity to the original environment. This makes them a significant detail, worth 2 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The sandy terrain with embedded pebbles is a foundational element of the desert floor. The texture and color of the sand, along with the scattered stones, provide tactile realism and ground-level detail. The instruction specifies anchoring the creature \"on the sandy terrain,\" meaning this surface must remain visually consistent. Altering the texture or removing the pebbles would disrupt the physical grounding of the surreal figure and break environmental logic. This is a critical functional element for anchoring the subject, hence a weight of 3 points.",

Since the instruction does not mention modifying the background, and the surreal creature is described as anchored within this setting, the hills must remain unaltered.

This gradient is not mentioned as something to be changed, and preserving it maintains the lighting consistency required for the shadow alignment. The sky serves as a neutral backdrop that enhances the surrealism without distracting from the subject. Its retention supports visual harmony and realism, making it an important but not core element, hence 1 point.",
