Description of reference image: The image features two blonde dolls as the primary subjects. One doll is positioned in the foreground, striking a ballet pose with a light-colored tutu and a navy cardigan tied around her waist. Her hair is styled in a braid. The second doll is seated on a fuchsia mat, wearing a pink top and jeans. Both dolls are placed on a display table with a pink surface. The background consists of a retail store setting with shelves displaying various dolls and accessories, framed pictures of children, and a large poster of a smiling girl.

Thinking process:  
The editing instructions specify transforming the dolls into a Japanese Ukiyo-e style, which involves bold outlines, flat color planes, and a simplified background. This means the dolls' postures, positions, and some clothing details can be stylized while retaining their core identities. The scene's retail environment can be replaced with a simplified background. However, the dolls' distinctive postures and key clothing features must remain recognizable.

Allowed Changes List:  
- Specific textures of the dolls' clothing and hair can be simplified into flat color planes.  
- The retail store background can be replaced with a subtly patterned, simplified background.  
- The dolls' proportions and angles may be adjusted slightly to fit the Ukiyo-e style.  

Step 2 - Determine the elements that should remain unchanged:

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements include the dolls' postures and key clothing features, such as the tutu and cardigan for the standing doll and the pink top for the seated doll. Functional/logical association elements include the dolls' positions relative to each other and the display table. Remaining elements, such as the dolls' hair styles and the general shape of the tutu, should also be retained for visual coherence.

Preservation Targets List:  
- The ballet pose of the standing doll.  
- The seated position of the second doll.  
- The tutu and cardigan of the standing doll.  
- The pink top of the seated doll.  
- The dolls' hairstyles.
