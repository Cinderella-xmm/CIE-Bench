Description of reference image: The subject is a young child sitting cross-legged on a light wooden floor, facing slightly to the left of the frame. She has light brown hair tied back in a low ponytail with loose strands framing her face. Her facial features are soft and natural, with dark brown eyes focused intently on a black tablet device placed on a small, minimalist wooden table in front of her. The tablet is propped open at an angle using its built-in cover stand. She wears a short-sleeved, rust-colored t-shirt with a round neckline and blue denim jeans. Her hands are clasped together between her knees, and she is barefoot. The background consists of a neutral-toned living room environment: a light gray sofa with clean lines is visible behind her, partially out of focus, against a plain off-white wall. The lighting is soft and diffused, suggesting natural daylight from an unseen window, casting subtle shadows and highlighting the textures of her clothing, skin, and the wood grain of the table and floor.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions that clearly state what can be changed. The instruction specifies transforming the child into a chibi-style Funko Pop figure within packaging, including stylized accessories like headphones or app icons, and rendering a realistic version of the figure outside the box. This implies that the form, proportions, and style of the child’s representation are allowed to change significantly—specifically, her body shape, facial features, and pose may be altered for cartoonish effect. The scene (living room) is not required to be preserved; instead, it will be replaced by a product visualization setup featuring packaging and a separate realistic render. However, the instruction does not allow changes to the core identity of the child as the subject—her appearance must still be recognizable as the original individual. Elements such as hairstyle, clothing color, and posture are referenced in the transformation but are not explicitly stated as modifiable in terms of their essential characteristics. Therefore, while the style and context can change, the visual traits that define her identity must remain consistent.

Allowed Changes List:
- The overall form and proportion of the child (e.g., chibi style, exaggerated head-to-body ratio)
- The artistic style of the figure (Funko Pop, isometric view, cartoon rendering)
- The presence and design of tech accessories (headphones, app icons) added to the figure
- The scene environment (replacement with product packaging and studio-like setting)
- The position and orientation of the figure (sitting cross-legged inside packaging vs. standing outside)
- The texture and lighting of the figure in the realistic render (lifelike textures and lighting)
- The inclusion of a tablet in the packaging (as part of the new design)

Step 2 - Determine the elements that should remain unchanged

Thinking process:
Core recognition elements: The child's identity must be preserved despite stylistic transformation. Key identifiers include her distinct facial structure—particularly the shape of her eyes, nose, and mouth—and her unique hair color and style (light brown, tied in a low ponytail). These are essential for maintaining recognition across different representations. Additionally, her clothing colors (rust-colored t-shirt and blue jeans) serve as strong visual anchors for identification. If these were altered beyond recognition, the edited image would fail to represent the same individual.

Functional/logical association elements: The interaction between the child and the tablet is central to the narrative of the original image. Although the tablet may be repositioned or stylized in the new design, its presence and function as a focal point of attention must be retained. The act of looking at the screen is implied by her gaze direction and posture, which supports the "tech whiz" theme. Thus, the directional focus toward the tablet must be preserved in both the packaged and realistic versions.

Non modified element deduction: After excluding allowed changes (such as style, scale, and environment), the remaining unmentioned details—like the specific shade of her t-shirt, the texture of her jeans, the exact positioning of her hands, and the natural lighting on her skin—must be retained to maintain visual coherence. These elements contribute to the authenticity of the original subject and help distinguish her from other children. Even though they are not core, they support the integrity of the original image.

Preservation Targets List:
- The child’s facial features: eye shape, nose bridge, lip contour
- Hair color and style: light brown, low ponytail with loose strands
- Clothing colors: rust-colored t-shirt and blue denim jeans
- Posture: sitting cross-legged with hands clasped between knees
- Gaze direction: focused toward the tablet
- Presence and placement of the tablet on the wooden table
- Bare feet and lack of footwear
- Natural skin tone and texture
- Light wooden floor and table material

Q1:  
Thinking process: The shape and arrangement of the child’s eyes are critical for facial recognition. In the original image, her eyes are almond-shaped with dark brown irises and a clear reflection of light, indicating a specific gaze direction. This feature is essential for identifying her as the same individual, especially when transformed into a stylized figure. Losing this detail would make the character unrecognizable, making it a core identity element.  
Question: Are the child’s eyes almond-shaped with dark brown irises and a visible light reflection?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The hair color and style are key identifiers. The original image shows light brown hair tied in a low ponytail with loose strands framing the face. This specific combination distinguishes her from others and must be preserved even if stylized. Changing the color or style would alter her identity.  
Question: Is the child’s hair light brown and styled in a low ponytail with loose strands around the face?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The rust-colored t-shirt is a distinctive garment that contributes to the child’s visual identity. Its color and cut are specific and not generic. While the style may be simplified in the Funko Pop version, the color must remain consistent to preserve recognition.  
Question: Does the child wear a short-sleeved, rust-colored t-shirt with a round neckline?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The blue denim jeans are another key clothing item that helps identify the subject. Their color and fit are consistent with the original image. Even if the figure is stylized, the jeans must retain their blue hue and casual appearance.  
Question: Are the child’s pants blue denim jeans?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The posture of sitting cross-legged with hands clasped between the knees is a defining action in the original image. It conveys focus and engagement with the tablet. This pose must be preserved in both the packaged and realistic versions to maintain continuity.  
Question: Is the child sitting cross-legged with her hands clasped between her knees?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The gaze direction toward the tablet is crucial for maintaining the narrative of engagement with technology. The child’s eyes are directed at the screen, which establishes the functional relationship between her and the device. This must be preserved to uphold the “tech whiz” theme.  
Question: Is the child’s gaze directed toward the tablet on the table?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The presence of the tablet on the wooden table is a functional element that supports the scene’s logic. Although the tablet may be stylized, its location and role as the object of attention must remain. Removing or relocating it would break the connection to the original context.  
Question: Is there a black tablet placed on a small wooden table in front of the child?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q8:  
Thinking process: The child is barefoot, which is a minor but identifiable detail. While not central to identity, it adds to the realism and consistency of the original image. Retaining this detail ensures fidelity to the source.  
Question: Is the child barefoot with no footwear on her feet?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q9:  
Thinking process: The light wooden floor and table have a distinct grain pattern and warm tone that contribute to the overall aesthetic. These materials are part of the original environment and should be preserved in the realistic render to maintain visual coherence.  
Question: Is the floor and table made of light-colored wood with visible grain patterns?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes
