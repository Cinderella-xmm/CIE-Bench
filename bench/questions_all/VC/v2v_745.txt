Description of reference image: The image depicts a group of people at a train station platform, preparing to board a blue and orange train. The individuals are dressed in casual attire suitable for travel, with many carrying luggage such as suitcases and backpacks. The train has a sleek design with rectangular windows, and the platform is covered by an overhead structure. The people are positioned in a line near the open doors of the train, suggesting they are about to embark on a journey.

Thinking process: The instructions specify transforming the characters into Chibi-style stickers while retaining their travel-related context. This means the core identity of the characters as travelers and their associated luggage must be preserved. However, the background and scene can be simplified or removed since the focus shifts to individual characters in a stylized format.

Allowed Changes List:
Specific element 1 that allows for changes: The background can be made transparent.
Specific element 2 that allows for changes: The train and platform can be simplified or excluded.
Specific element 3 that allows for changes: The proportions and styles of the characters can be adjusted to fit the Chibi aesthetic.

Step 2 - Determine the elements that should remain unchanged
Thinking process:
Core recognition elements: The characters' roles as travelers must be clear, identifiable by their luggage and travel attire. These elements are crucial for maintaining the travel theme.
Functional/logical association elements: The luggage and travel attire must be retained to support the travel context. The characters' postures and actions should reflect travel-related activities.
Non-modified element deduction: Details like the specific types of luggage (suitcases, backpacks) and the general attire (jackets, jeans) should be kept to maintain visual coherence.

Preservation Targets List:
(Element 1 that should be maintained): Travel-related luggage (suitcases, backpacks).
(Element 2 that should be maintained): Travel attire (jackets, jeans, etc.).
(Element 3 that should be maintained): Characters' postures and actions reflecting travel.
