**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

Description of reference image:  
The subject is a historic church building with a Baroque architectural style, located in an open public square. The church features a white-painted façade with stone trim, a central arched doorway topped by a cross and decorative stonework, a round window above the entrance, and a bell tower with a dome and spire. The roof is red-tiled, and the structure includes multiple ornamental finials and pilasters. To the left of the church, there is a multi-story building adorned with blue-and-white azulejo tiles, featuring balconies and large windows. In front of this building, a café occupies the sidewalk under large white umbrellas, with people seated at tables. Several pedestrians are walking across the paved plaza. A tree with green foliage stands near the café. The sky is partly cloudy with soft daylight illuminating the scene.

Thinking process:  
The editing instruction specifies transforming the entire scene into a **miniature porcelain diorama encased within a baroque-styled dome**, with specific material transformations:  
- The church must be rendered in **fine china** with intricate details.  
- People must be replaced with **tiny pewter figures**.  
- The café tables and trees must be crafted from **delicate glass**.  
- The entire scene must sit atop an **antique marble base**.  

This implies that the **form and composition of the scene** (church, plaza, café, people, trees) can be reinterpreted in miniature scale and altered materials, but the **spatial layout and key structural elements** must remain recognizable to preserve identity.  

Allowed changes include:  
- Material transformation of all objects (e.g., stone → porcelain, flesh → pewter).  
- Scale reduction to miniature.  
- Encasement in a baroque-style dome.  
- Replacement of real humans with figurines.  
- Change in medium (real-world → diorama).  

However, the **identity-defining visual characteristics** of the original elements—such as the church’s shape, the café’s location, the tree’s position, and the overall spatial relationship—must be preserved to maintain recognition.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
- Material of the church (stone → fine china)  
- Material of people (flesh → pewter figures)  
- Material of café tables and chairs (wood/metal → glass)  
- Material of tree (living plant → delicate glass)  
- Scale of the entire scene (full-size → miniature)  
- Enclosure of the scene in a baroque-styled dome  
- Base material (paved plaza → antique marble base)  
- Presence of people (real → figurine form)  
- Overall presentation (realistic photograph → diorama)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements are those that define the identity of the scene or subject. For this image, the **church's architectural form**—specifically its **Baroque façade, central arched doorway, round window, bell tower with dome and spire, and red-tiled roof**—are essential for identification. These features are iconic and distinguish this building from others. Even if made of porcelain, their **shape, proportion, and placement** must be retained.

Functional/logical association elements:  
- The **spatial relationship** between the church and the café area must be preserved (café to the left of the church).  
- The **tree’s position relative to the café** must remain consistent.  
- The **presence of the paved plaza** and **steps leading up to the church** must be maintained in layout, even if transformed into marble.  
- The **relative positions of people** (walking, sitting, standing) should reflect the original scene’s logic.

Non-modified element deduction:  
After excluding allowed changes (materials, scale, enclosure), the remaining **structural forms, proportions, and layout** must be preserved. This includes:  
- The **architectural silhouette** of the church.  
- The **location and orientation** of the café and umbrella structures.  
- The **tree’s placement** near the café.  
- The **cross on the church’s façade** and **bell visible in the tower**.  
- The **azulejo-tiled building** to the left, including its balcony and window pattern.

These are not explicitly mentioned as changeable and are critical for maintaining visual coherence and recognition.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
- The church’s central arched doorway with cross above it  
- The round window above the doorway  
- The bell tower with dome and spire  
- The red-tiled roof  
- The café with white umbrellas positioned to the left of the church  
- The tree near the café  
- The steps leading up to the church  
- The azulejo-tiled building with balconies to the left  
- The cross atop the bell tower  
- The presence of people in the plaza and café, in similar positions

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The central arched doorway with the cross above it is a core architectural feature of the church, uniquely identifying its religious function and Baroque design. Its presence and position are essential for recognizing the building as a church. If removed or altered beyond recognition, the identity of the structure would be lost. Therefore, this is a 3-point question.
    Question: Is the central arched doorway with a cross above it present in the same position on the church facade?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The round window directly above the entrance is a distinctive architectural detail that contributes to the church’s identity. It is a unique feature not found in typical rectangular windows and helps distinguish this building. Its removal would alter the visual signature of the façade, making it less recognizable. Thus, it is a 3-point element.
