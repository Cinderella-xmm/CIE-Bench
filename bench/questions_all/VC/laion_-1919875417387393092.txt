**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a miniature wooden pottery workshop setup, composed of two stacked rustic wooden tables made from weathered planks with visible grain and rough edges. The top table holds several unfinished gray clay objects: two vase-like forms with narrow necks, one flat circular base with a central hole (possibly a potter’s wheel component), and a smaller rounded lump of clay. A rectangular block of gray clay rests on the lower table, alongside a small wooden tool resembling a modeling rib. White fabric scraps are draped over the edge of the lower table and scattered beneath it. The entire structure sits on a flat wooden base, forming a compact diorama-style scene. The background is plain white, emphasizing the object's details. The materials are clearly natural—wood with textured surfaces, unglazed gray clay, and coarse textile.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction specifies transforming the scene into a "charming diorama displayed inside a glass cloche," which implies a complete enclosure and change in presentation format. It explicitly calls for:
- Adding **vibrant patina** to the clay pieces → alters surface appearance but not shape or form.
- Introducing **miniature fairies kneading clay amid tools** → adds new characters and actions not present originally.
- Incorporating **lush moss and tiny flowers around the tabletop edges** → modifies surrounding environment.
- Placing a **wooden plaque with engraved artisan details at the base** → introduces a new structural element.

However, the instruction does **not** state that the original wooden table structure, the basic shapes of the clay vessels, or their placement should be changed—it only describes embellishments and additions. Thus, while the **visual style** and **context** are to be transformed, the **core physical arrangement** and **identity-defining features** of the original pottery setup must remain intact unless overridden by explicit replacement.

Allowed Changes List:
- Addition of glass cloche enclosure
- Application of vibrant patina to clay pieces
- Introduction of miniature fairies
- Addition of moss and tiny flowers along edges
- Placement of wooden plaque with engraving at base
- Alteration of lighting and atmosphere to evoke enchantment

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
Core recognition elements:  
The identity of this object as a **pottery workshop diorama** hinges on its **distinctive wooden table structure**, the **specific shapes of the clay vessels**, and the **presence of tools and raw materials**. These define it as a representation of a potter’s workspace. Even with added fantasy elements, the underlying **form and function** of the setup must persist. For example:
- The **three-tiered wooden shelf structure** with horizontal slats and vertical supports is essential to recognizing the object as a workbench setup.
- The **shapes of the clay vases**—one bulbous with a pinched neck, another more symmetrical—are unique and distinguishable; altering them would lose the original design intent.
- The **rectangular block of clay** and **modeling tool** represent actual working materials; removing or replacing them would misrepresent the scene’s purpose.

Functional/logical association elements:  
The **spatial relationship** between the clay objects and the wooden surfaces is critical. The **placement of the clay on the tables**, especially the larger vase near the front and the flat disc behind it, creates a logical composition suggesting use. Changing positions could disrupt the narrative of a working space.

Non-modified element deduction:  
Any feature not mentioned in the allowed changes list must be retained. This includes:
- The **texture of the wood** (rough, aged, splintered edges)
- The **color and material of the clay** (gray, matte, unglazed)
- The **white fabric scraps** draped over the table
- The **flat wooden base** supporting the structure

Although the instruction allows adding moss and flowers, it does not say to remove existing elements. Therefore, all original components must coexist unless replaced explicitly.

Preservation Targets List:
- The three-tiered wooden table structure with horizontal slats and vertical supports
- The specific shapes of the four clay objects: two vases, one flat circular piece, one rectangular block
- The presence and position of the modeling tool on the lower table
- The texture and color of the wood (weathered, brown, rough)
- The presence of white fabric scraps on and under the table
- The flat wooden base beneath the entire structure
- The spatial layout of objects on the tables (e.g., vases on upper tier, block on lower)

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The three-tiered wooden table structure with horizontal slats and vertical supports is the core architectural form of the diorama. Its existence defines the scene as a workshop bench rather than a display case or altar. Removing or altering this structure would fundamentally change the object's identity. It is a structural anchor and therefore a key identification feature.
    Question: Is the three-tiered wooden table structure with horizontal slats and vertical supports still present?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The two distinct clay vases—one with a pinched neck and irregular shape, the other more symmetrical—are signature forms that identify the pottery being worked on. Their presence and shape are essential to recognizing the scene as a pottery workshop. Losing either would obscure the intended craft context.
    Question: Are both the asymmetrical clay vase with a pinched neck and the symmetrical clay vase still present on the upper tier?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The flat circular clay piece with a central hole is a distinctive component, likely representing a potter’s wheel disk or lid. Its unique shape and position make it an identifiable part of the setup. It contributes to the functional logic of the scene and cannot be replaced without losing authenticity.
    Question: Is the flat circular clay piece with a central hole still positioned on the upper tier behind the vases?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The rectangular block of clay on the lower table is a key indicator of raw material in the process of shaping. Its presence supports the narrative of active pottery work. While its color may change due to patina, its shape and location must remain consistent to preserve the scene’s logic.
    Question: Is the rectangular block of gray clay still present on the lower table?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The white fabric scraps draped over the edge and under the table are minor but visually significant details that add realism and texture to the scene. They suggest cloth used for cleaning or covering tools. Though not central, they contribute to the overall coherence and authenticity of the workshop setting.
    Question: Are the white fabric scraps still visible draped over the edge and under the lower table?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The modeling tool resembling a wooden rib is a functional accessory indicating active craftsmanship. Its placement next to the clay block suggests use. Removing it would reduce the sense of activity and diminish the workshop feel.
    Question: Is the small wooden modeling tool still present on the lower table near the clay block?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The flat wooden base supports the entire structure and grounds it spatially. It is part of the original construction and provides stability. Even if a plaque is added, the base must remain intact to maintain the physical integrity of the diorama.
    Question: Is the flat wooden base supporting the entire structure still present?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
