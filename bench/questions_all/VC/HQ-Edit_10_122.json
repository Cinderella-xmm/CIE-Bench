      "thinking_process": "The subject’s facial features—particularly the shape of the eyes, the fullness of the lips, the high cheekbones, and the warm brown skin tone—are core identification markers.

      "thinking_process": "The large gold hoop earrings are a prominent accessory and a key visual anchor in the image. They are not only stylistic but also functional in framing the face.

      "thinking_process": "The patterned top with its specific color blocks (red, blue, yellow, orange) and central eye-like motif is a key identifier of the cultural attire. The geometric design and symbolic eye pattern are unique to the original image. Altering the pattern or removing the eye motif would lose the cultural specificity and visual coherence.",

      "thinking_process": "The subject’s pose—head turned slightly to the right, hand raised near the chin—is a compositional anchor. It conveys confidence and grace.
