### Step 1 - Allowed Changes List

**Description of reference image:**  
The image shows a clean and minimalistic setup of a desktop computer on a wooden desk. The setup includes a monitor, a computer tower, a speaker, a keyboard, and a mouse. All items are black, contrasting with the light wood of the desk and the neutral wall behind it. The objects are arranged neatly, with the monitor centered, the speaker to the left, the computer tower to the right, and the keyboard and mouse in front.

**Thinking process:**  
The instructions specify transforming the objects into chibi-style collectible figures with exaggerated features, placed inside a pastel-toned box. This means the physical forms of the objects can change significantly. However, the essence of the objects (e.g., their function as a monitor, speaker, etc.) should still be recognizable. The scene is also transformed into a diorama setting, meaning the current background and desk can be altered.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
1. The physical forms of the objects can be changed to chibi-style collectibles with oversized, expressive features.  
2. The scene can be replaced with a diorama setting inside a pastel-toned box.  
3. The arrangement of objects can be adjusted to fit the new diorama layout.

### Step 2 - Preservation Targets List

**Thinking process:**  
Core recognition elements include the identifiable forms of the objects (monitor, speaker, etc.) even in a stylized form. Functional/logical associations mean the objects should still resemble their real-world counterparts in some way. Remaining elements like the color scheme and relative positions contribute to visual coherence.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
1. The recognizable forms of the monitor, speaker, computer tower, keyboard, and mouse.  
2. The black color scheme of the objects.  
3. The relative positions of the objects in relation to each other (e.g., the monitor remains central).

### Step 3 - Question Generation

**Q1:**  
Thinking process: The monitor is a key element, and its recognizable form (even in a stylized version) is crucial for identity. Losing this would make it unrecognizable.  
Question: Does the edited image retain a central object resembling a monitor, even in a stylized form?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

**Q2:**  
Thinking process: The speaker's recognizable form helps maintain the identity of the setup. Its presence is important for the overall scene.  
Question: Does the edited image include an object resembling a speaker, even in a stylized form?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

**Q3:**  
Thinking process: The computer tower's recognizable form is essential for maintaining the tech theme. Its presence ensures the scene's coherence.  
Question: Does the edited image include an object resembling a computer tower, even in a stylized form?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

**Q4:**  
Thinking process: The keyboard's recognizable form is important for maintaining the tech setup's identity. Its presence contributes to the overall scene.  
Question: Does the edited image include an object resembling a keyboard, even in a stylized form?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

**Q5:**  
Thinking process: The mouse's recognizable form is a minor detail but contributes to the completeness of the tech setup. Its presence adds to the scene's coherence.
