**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a traditional Norwegian stave church, characterized by its multi-tiered wooden structure with steeply pitched roofs covered in dark gray shingles. The building features intricate carved wooden patterns along the eaves, gables, and vertical supports, including stylized animal heads and interlacing designs typical of Norse architecture. At the top of the central spire is a cross-shaped finial with ornate metalwork. The roofline includes several upward-curving, horn-like projections resembling Viking ship prows or mythical creatures' antlers. The church stands on a grassy knoll surrounded by evergreen trees dusted with snow, flowering shrubs in pink and purple hues, and a stone pathway leading to the entrance. In the background, rolling hills transition into snow-capped mountains under a bright blue sky with fluffy white clouds. A flock of birds flies overhead in a V-formation. The overall color palette is naturalistic: warm brown wood tones, green grass, pale blue sky, and soft white snow.

Thinking process:  
The editing instructions explicitly state transformations that alter the form, material, and magical properties of the church and surrounding environment. Key changes include:
- Transforming the church into an ethereal magical tower (form change)
- Replacing the roof with shimmering crystal spires (material/structure change)
- Adding luminescent runes along wooden patterns (new surface details)
- Adorning spire tops with glowing celestial orbs (new elements)
- Converting trees into mystical silver spirals (replacement of tree forms)
- Creating ghostly bird apparitions circling the tower (replacement of real birds)

These changes allow for full transformation of the **subject’s physical form**, **roof materials**, **tree types**, **bird appearances**, and **atmospheric effects**. However, no instruction specifies retaining specific architectural motifs, spatial layout, or environmental positioning — meaning these are not explicitly preserved, but may still be foundational if not overridden.

Allowed Changes List:  
- The overall shape and function of the church can be changed into a magical tower  
- Roof material and structure can be replaced with crystal spires  
- Wooden carvings can be overlaid with luminescent runes  
- Spire tips can be adorned with glowing orbs  
- Trees can be transformed into silver spiral forms  
- Birds can be replaced with ghostly apparitions  
- Atmospheric lighting and visual effects can be enhanced with magic-like glow

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements must be identified based on what makes this image uniquely identifiable as a *stave church* in a *Norwegian landscape*. Even though the instructions permit dramatic transformation, certain visual traits define the original identity:

1. **Core Recognition Elements**:  
   - The **multi-tiered, stepped gable design** is iconic to stave churches; it distinguishes them from other wooden structures. While the roof may become crystal, the tiered silhouette should remain recognizable.  
   - The **presence of carved wooden ornamentation**—especially at eaves and gables—is essential to identifying the structure as a stave church. Even if runes are added, the underlying carved pattern should be retained or adapted.  
   - The **central spire with a cross finial** is a key religious identifier. Though it may be embellished with orbs, the cross must remain visible or structurally implied.  
   - The **horn-like projections** (dragon heads or antler motifs) on the roof corners are distinctive Norse decorative elements and should be preserved in form or position even if reimagined magically.  

2. **Functional/Logical Association Elements**:  
   - The **spatial relationship between the church and the surrounding landscape** (e.g., church on a hillside near water, with mountains in the distance) is crucial for scene coherence. While the trees and birds may change, their relative positions should not violate spatial logic.  
   - The **stone pathway leading to the main entrance** establishes access and orientation; it should remain present unless explicitly removed.  
   - The **entrance archway and steps** are functional components that define entry; altering their location would disrupt architectural logic.  

3. **Non-Modified Element Deduction**:  
   After excluding allowed changes (crystal roofs, glowing runes, silver trees), the following must be retained:  
   - The **general layered composition** of the building (base, mid-level, upper tiers)  
   - The **position and orientation** of the central spire and side gables  
   - The **placement of windows and doorways** in relation to the building's symmetry  
   - The **natural color scheme** (wood brown, green grass, blue sky) as a baseline unless overruled by magical tone  

Preservation Targets List:  
- The multi-tiered, stepped gable structure of the church  
- The presence of carved wooden patterns on eaves and gables  
- The central spire topped with a cross-shaped finial  
- The horn-like projections on the roof corners  
- The stone pathway leading to the front entrance  
- The location and orientation of the main arched doorway  
- The relative placement of the church on the hillside overlooking the lake and mountains  
- The presence of snow-dusted evergreens and flowering shrubs in the foreground

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

Q1:  
Thinking process: The multi-tiered, stepped gable structure is the defining architectural feature of a stave church. Its absence or replacement with a single conical tower would fundamentally alter the identity of the structure. This tiered silhouette is a core recognition element across historical references, making it essential to retain even when transformed into a magical tower. Losing it would make the building unrecognizable as a stave church derivative. Therefore, this element carries a weight of 3 points.  
Question: Does the edited image preserve the multi-tiered, stepped gable structure of the church, with at least three distinct roof levels stacked vertically?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The carved wooden patterns along the eaves and gables are unique to stave churches and represent cultural craftsmanship. Even if luminescent runes are added, the underlying carved texture must remain visible or implied to maintain authenticity. Removing or replacing these carvings entirely would erase a critical identifying trait. Thus, this is a key visual detail with a weight of 3 points.  
Question: Are there visible carved wooden patterns along the eaves and gables of the church, even if overlaid with glowing runes?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The central spire topped with a cross-shaped finial is both a religious symbol and an architectural hallmark. Although the instruction allows for glowing orbs, the cross must remain present or structurally recognizable to preserve the building’s identity as a church. Without it, the structure could be misidentified as a tower or monument. This is a core functional and symbolic element, warranting a weight of 3 points.  
Question: Is the cross-shaped finial still present at the very top of the central spire, even if partially obscured by glowing celestial orbs?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The horn-like projections on the roof corners are iconic Norse decorative elements, often representing dragon heads or mythological beasts. These are not just aesthetic—they are culturally significant markers. Even if transformed into swirling cloud shapes, their position and angular form should be retained. Their removal would undermine the architectural style. This is a high-priority detail, assigned 2 points.  
Question: Are there horn-like or antler-shaped projections extending from the corners of the roof sections, especially at the top tiers?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The stone pathway leading to the main entrance provides spatial continuity and logical access. It grounds the structure in reality and connects it to the viewer. While the path may glow or appear enchanted, its existence and route must remain consistent. Its absence would break environmental logic. This is an important structural element, assigned 2 points.  
Question: Is there a stone-paved pathway leading directly from the foreground to the main entrance of the church?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The main arched doorway with steps leading up to it defines the primary access point and symmetrical balance of the building. Changing its position or removing it would distort the architectural integrity. Even if the door glows or becomes translucent, its location and form must be preserved. This is a functional and compositional anchor, assigned 2 points.  
Question: Is there a clearly defined arched doorway located at the center of the front facade, accessible via a short flight of steps?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The surrounding environment—specifically the snow-dusted evergreen trees and flowering shrubs—establishes the setting and season. While trees may become silver spirals, the presence of conifers and pink-purple flowers in the foreground must be retained in some form to preserve the original scene’s atmosphere. Their loss would disconnect the structure from its natural context. This is a secondary but important environmental cue, assigned 1 point.  
Question: Are there evergreen trees with snow on their branches and clusters of pink or purple flowering shrubs in the immediate foreground around the church?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q8:  
Thinking process: The backdrop of snow-capped mountains and a lake beneath a partly cloudy sky creates the geographical context. While the sky may gain magical glow, the mountain range and water body must remain in their relative positions to maintain scene coherence. Their removal or relocation would destroy the landscape’s realism. This is a key environmental feature, assigned 2 points.  
Question: Are snow-covered mountains visible in the background behind the church, with a body of water situated between the church and the mountains?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2
