Description of reference image: The subject is a modern Mercedes-Benz Sprinter van, shown in a metallic gray color. The van is positioned at an angle, showcasing the front and side profile. It has a sleek design with a large windshield, a prominent Mercedes-Benz logo on the grille, and a streamlined hood with air vents. The vehicle features standard side mirrors, wheels, and a closed cargo area with no visible windows on the sides. The background is plain white, emphasizing the van.

### Step 1 - Allowed Changes List:

**Thinking process:**  
The instructions specify transforming the van into a brightly colored vintage surf van from the 1970s. This involves changing the color scheme, adding chrome accents, surfboards, and altering the photographic style. The scene can be changed to a sunny, slightly desaturated beach setting. However, the core structure and basic form of the van must remain intact.

**Allowed Changes List:**
- Color scheme (changing to teal and white with chrome accents)
- Addition of surfboards and roof rack
- Photographic style (sunny, slightly desaturated look)
- Scene transformation (from plain white to a beach setting)

### Step 2 - Preservation Targets List:

**Thinking process:**  
Core recognition elements include the van's iconic shape, the Mercedes-Benz grille, and the overall structure. Functional/logical elements include the placement of wheels and the general proportions of the van. Remaining elements like the van's clean lines and the absence of side windows should also be retained for visual coherence.

**Preservation Targets List:**
- The van's overall shape and structure
- The Mercedes-Benz grille and logo
- The placement and size of wheels
- The clean lines and lack of side windows
