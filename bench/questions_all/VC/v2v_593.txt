### Step 1 - Description of Reference Image:
The subject is a kangaroo captured mid-hop on a dirt path surrounded by lush green grass and trees. The kangaroo has a brown coat with lighter underparts, large hind legs, a long tail, and upright ears. Its posture shows dynamic movement, with its legs extended and tail balancing its motion. The background consists of a serene park-like setting with scattered trees and a clear pathway leading into the distance.

### Thinking Process:
The editing instructions specify transforming the kangaroo into a Funko Pop figure and its packaging while retaining certain elements. The scene and background are not required to be retained, allowing for significant changes. However, the kangaroo's core identity features must be preserved even in its stylized form.

### Allowed Changes List:
- The kangaroo's form can be redesigned into a Funko Pop figure with an isometric perspective.
- The scene can be replaced with a product presentation setup.
- The kangaroo's size, proportions, and some details can be adjusted for the Funko Pop style.
- The background can be entirely changed to focus on the product presentation.

### Step 2 - Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged:

#### Thinking Process:
**Core Recognition Elements:** The kangaroo's iconic features—its large hind legs, long tail, and overall shape—are crucial for recognition. These must be retained in the Funko Pop design.

**Functional/Logical Association Elements:** The kangaroo's pouch and hopping-related elements (hind legs and tail) are essential for maintaining the logical connection to its natural behavior.

**Non-modified Element Deduction:** The kangaroo's brown coloration and the chibi-style depiction inside the box should retain some resemblance to the original for visual coherence.

#### Preservation Targets List:
- Kangaroo's large hind legs and long tail.
- Presence of a pouch.
- Brown coloration of the kangaroo.
- Hopping-related elements (hind legs and tail).

### Step 3 - Generate Yes/No Questions:

#### Q1:
Thinking process: The kangaroo's large hind legs are a core recognition feature. Losing this would make it unidentifiable as a kangaroo, thus it is a key element with a weight of 3 points.

Question: Is the long tail of the kangaroo preserved in the Funko Pop figure?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
Weight: 3

#### Q3:
Thinking process: The pouch is a functional element associated with kangaroos. Its presence helps maintain the logical connection to the animal's identity, making it an important element with a weight of 2 points.
Question: Does the chibi-style kangaroo figure inside the box include a pouch?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
Weight: 2

#### Q4:
Thinking process: The brown coloration is a distinctive feature of the kangaroo. Retaining this color helps maintain visual coherence and assists in identifying the subject, making it an important element with a weight of 2 points.
