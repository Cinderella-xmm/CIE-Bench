      "thinking_process": "The orange circular logo with the white animal figure is a unique identifier on the sack, distinguishing it from generic bags. Its presence is crucial for recognizing the branding and contextual authenticity of the worker’s equipment. If lost or replaced, the sack becomes indistinguishable, undermining the scene’s realism and identity. This is a core visual element with high recognition value.",

      "thinking_process": "The worker’s hand reaching into the tea leaves is the central action of the image. It defines the activity and purpose of the scene. Without this gesture, the image loses its narrative function. Even if enlarged, the hand must still be engaged with the plants. This is a functional and narrative anchor.",
      "question": "Is the worker’s right hand visibly reaching into the tea bush to pick leaves?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The worker’s bent-forward posture is essential to depict the physical effort and method of tea picking. A straight or upright stance would contradict the activity. While proportions may change due to cartoonization, the overall lean must remain. This posture is critical for maintaining the action’s plausibility.",
      "question": "Is the worker leaning forward with her upper body angled downward toward the tea plants?",

      "thinking_process": "The sack is tied around the worker’s waist and hangs from the left side, which is a practical detail reflecting how harvesters carry their yield. Changing its position or removing it would disrupt the functional logic of the scene. Its location is a key spatial relationship.",
      "question": "Is the sack positioned on the left side of the worker’s waist and hanging downward?",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The tea plantation’s layout — rows of green plants extending diagonally across the slope — establishes the environment and scale. While colors may be enhanced, the row structure and terrain slope must remain to preserve the setting’s identity. This is a key environmental feature.",
      "question": "Are the tea plants arranged in distinct diagonal rows across a sloped terrain?",

      "thinking_process": "The olive-green shirt worn by the worker is a defining feature of her attire and helps identify her as a laborer in this context. While cartoonization may simplify folds or shading, the color and long-sleeve shape must remain to maintain visual continuity. This is a secondary but identifiable detail.",
      "question": "Does the worker wear a long-sleeved olive-green shirt?",

      "thinking_process": "The worker’s dark hair tied in a low ponytail with loose strands is a personal detail contributing to her identity and realism. While cartoonization may soften edges, the hairstyle must remain recognizable to preserve the subject’s appearance. This is a minor but consistent trait.",
      "question": "Is the worker’s dark hair styled in a low ponytail with some loose strands near the face?",
