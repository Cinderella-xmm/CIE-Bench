**Step 1 – Analyze editing instructions and determine allowed changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a woman standing in an outdoor gathering, positioned slightly off-center to the right. She wears a bright red headscarf wrapped tightly around her head, with a decorative multicolored beaded band across her forehead. Her facial expression is calm and composed, with a slight smile. She is dressed in a black long-sleeve top beneath a richly embroidered blue vest adorned with intricate geometric patterns in red, yellow, green, and orange threadwork, including fringe details along the neckline. The vest features bold vertical stripes and symbolic motifs resembling traditional African textile designs. She holds a large, hand-painted bowl in both hands; the bowl has a vibrant design with abstract shapes, palm tree silhouettes, and horizontal bands in blue, yellow, red, and green, outlined with pink string trim. The background consists of blurred figures in colorful clothing, trees with dense foliage, and soft natural daylight filtering through the canopy. A tall tree trunk is visible behind her, and other individuals are seen interacting or taking photos.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction explicitly transforms the image into a digital RPG-style character card titled "Guardian of Heritage." This transformation involves significant stylization: rendering the woman in a semi-realistic art style, adding stat bars (Wisdom +9, Cultural Insight +10, Grace +8, Unity +9), inserting a woven-texture title banner at the top, a gold-etched nameplate below, framing with geometric tribal motifs, and placing her against a warm, abstracted nature background featuring trees and gathering figures.  

Key aspects of the original scene—such as the real-world environment, crowd, and lighting—are not required to be preserved. Instead, the instruction mandates a new artistic composition with symbolic elements. However, it does **not** state that the woman’s identity, attire, or held object should be altered in terms of core visual characteristics—only that they be rendered in a semi-realistic art style. Therefore, while the overall presentation changes, the **iconic visual traits** of the subject must remain identifiable.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
- Background environment (real trees and crowd → abstracted nature scene with gathering figures)  
- Image format (photograph → digital collectible card)  
- Art style (photorealistic → semi-realistic digital illustration)  
- Composition layout (natural portrait → framed RPG card with banners, stats, borders)  
- Lighting and color tone (adjusted for warmth and thematic consistency)  
- Presence of surrounding people (can be abstracted or removed)  
- Tree trunk and sky visibility (can be replaced with stylized elements)  
- Proportions and angles (may be adjusted for card framing)  

Note: The instruction does **not** allow changes to the **subject’s identity**, **core attire**, or **held object**—they are to be preserved but re-rendered stylistically.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Step 2 – Determine elements that should remain unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
Core recognition elements are those essential to identifying the subject and her cultural representation. These include:
- The **red headscarf** with the **multicolored beaded forehead band**—a distinctive cultural marker.
- The **blue embroidered vest** with **specific geometric patterns**, especially the **pink fringes** along the neckline and **vertical striped motifs**.
- The **hand-painted bowl** she holds, which features **distinctive painted symbols** (palm trees, abstract shapes, colored bands) and **pink string trim**—this is a key accessory tied to cultural expression.
- The **woman’s facial features**—especially her **skin tone**, **facial structure**, **expression**, and **earring**—which define her identity within the image.

Functional/logical association elements:
- The **act of holding the bowl** must be preserved because it represents a meaningful cultural gesture. Changing this would break the functional narrative of the character as a guardian of heritage.
- The **relationship between the subject and the bowl** (both hands supporting it, central positioning) must remain intact to maintain logical coherence.

Non-modified element deduction:
After excluding allowed changes (background, style, framing), all **visual traits not mentioned as changeable** must be retained. This includes:
- The **color palette** of the outfit (red, blue, black, orange, yellow, green)
- The **texture of beadwork and embroidery**
- The **presence and design of the bowl**
- The **positioning of the headscarf and its fold pattern**
- The **shape and orientation of the face and gaze**

These are not explicitly allowed to change, so they must be preserved even under stylization.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
- The red headscarf with the multicolored beaded band across the forehead  
- The blue embroidered vest with pink fringe and geometric patterns  
- The hand-painted bowl with palm tree motifs, colored bands, and pink string trim  
- The woman’s facial features including skin tone, eye shape, earring, and expression  
- The act of holding the bowl with both hands in front of her body  
- The black long-sleeve base layer under the vest  
- The specific arrangement of colors and patterns on the vest (e.g., vertical stripes, cross motifs)  
- The position of the bowl relative to her torso (centered, held horizontally)

**Step 3 – Generate yes/no questions based on key visual elements**

Q1:  
Thinking process: The red headscarf with the multicolored beaded band across the forehead is a core identity feature. It is visually distinct and culturally significant. If this is altered in color, shape, or placement, the subject's cultural representation and identity would be compromised. Its presence and exact form are critical for recognition, making it a 3-point element.  
Question: Is the red headscarf with the multicolored beaded band across the forehead present and accurately depicted?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3

Q2:  
Thinking process: The blue embroidered vest with pink fringe and geometric patterns is a defining piece of attire. The specific combination of colors, patterns, and texture identifies the cultural origin. Altering these would misrepresent the subject’s heritage. The fringe detail is particularly iconic and must be preserved.  
Question: Is the blue vest with pink fringe along the neckline and vertical geometric patterns visible and correctly represented?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3

Q3:  
Thinking process: The hand-painted bowl is a central object in the image and symbolizes cultural practice. Its unique design—including palm trees, colored bands, and pink string trim—is essential for identification. Removing or altering it would break the narrative of “Guardian of Heritage.”  
Question: Is the hand-painted bowl with palm tree motifs, colored bands, and pink string trim clearly shown and accurately rendered?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3

Q4:  
Thinking process: The woman’s facial features—especially her skin tone, eye shape, earring, and expression—are key to personal identity. Even in stylized art, these must remain recognizable to preserve the subject’s authenticity. Changing them would result in a different person being portrayed.  
Question: Are the woman’s facial features, including her skin tone, eye shape, earring, and slight smile, preserved and clearly visible?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3

Q5:  
Thinking process: The act of holding the bowl with both hands in front of the body is a functional gesture tied to cultural context. It conveys respect and purpose. Altering this pose would disrupt the narrative logic and reduce the authenticity of the character’s role.  
Question: Is the woman holding the bowl with both hands in front of her body, maintaining the same posture as in the original image?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2

Q6:  
Thinking process: The black long-sleeve base layer under the vest is a consistent part of her outfit. While not as visually striking, it provides contrast and structural integrity to the ensemble. Removing it would alter the clothing hierarchy and affect the visual balance.  
Question: Is the black long-sleeve garment visible underneath the blue vest?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1

Q7:  
Thinking process: The specific arrangement of colors and patterns on the vest—such as the vertical stripes and cross motifs—adds to the cultural specificity. These are not random but represent traditional designs. Their preservation ensures accurate representation.  
Question: Are the vertical striped patterns and cross-shaped motifs on the vest accurately maintained in color and placement?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2

Q8:  
Thinking process: The position of the bowl relative to the torso—centered and held horizontally—is important for visual balance and symbolic meaning. Moving it upward or sideways would change the composition and implied action.  
Question: Is the bowl positioned horizontally and centered in front of the woman’s torso?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1
