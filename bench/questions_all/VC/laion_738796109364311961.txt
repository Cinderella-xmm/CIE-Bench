Description of reference image: The subject is a football player in a maroon uniform with the number 24, wearing a red helmet featuring a white cougar logo, running forward while holding a football. He has long dreadlocks extending from under his helmet and is wearing white cleats with gray socks. His posture is dynamic, leaning forward mid-stride, with one leg extended behind him and the other bent beneath him. He is being pursued by an opposing player in a white uniform with the number 89, wearing a black helmet with a yellow "C" logo, who is lunging toward him. The background shows a blurred stadium crowd, with spectators in various colors, some wearing team apparel. The field is green artificial turf with white yard lines visible. Raindrops are faintly visible in the air, indicating wet weather conditions.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions that clearly state what can be changed: the style must be cartoon-inspired, with exaggerated poses, enlarged muscles, vibrant colors, stylized backgrounds, and presentation in a collector’s box. This means the form, proportions, and visual tone of the players can be altered significantly. However, the instruction specifies retaining the **team's logo on the helmet and jersey**, which implies these logos must remain recognizable despite stylistic changes. It also mentions showcasing the **football field** and **roaring crowd** in the background, so these scene elements must be preserved in concept, though their representation may be stylized. Elements not mentioned as changeable—such as the specific positions of the players (e.g., one running, one lunging), the presence of the football, or the color schemes of uniforms—are not explicitly allowed to be changed and thus should be retained unless contradicted by the transformation logic.

Allowed Changes List:
- Player body proportions (muscles enlarged)
- Pose exaggeration (dynamic, cartoon-style action)
- Uniform colors (vibrant, possibly saturated beyond realism)
- Background details (stylized crowd, field, lighting)
- Overall artistic style (cartoon-like, illustrative)
- Presentation format (collector’s box with transparent lid)

Step 2 - Determine the elements that should remain unchanged

Thinking process:
Core recognition elements: The identity of the players is tied to their team affiliations, which are signaled through distinct logos. The cougar logo on the maroon helmet and the "C" emblem on the black helmet are key identifiers for Washington State and Cal teams respectively. These logos are essential for recognizing the teams involved and must be preserved even if stylized. The numbers "24" and "89" are also core identifiers of individual players and must remain present and readable. The football itself is central to the action and cannot be omitted without losing narrative context.

Functional/logical association elements: The interaction between the two players—the runner holding the ball and the defender lunging—is a functional action sequence critical to understanding the scene. The relative positions (one ahead, one reaching) maintain logical spatial coherence and must be preserved to retain the sense of pursuit and motion. The presence of the football in the hand of the player in maroon is a functional detail necessary for the action to make sense.

Non modified element deduction: After excluding allowed changes such as muscle size, pose exaggeration, and background stylization, the remaining unmentioned elements include the actual team logos, player numbers, helmet design, uniform color scheme (maroon vs. white), and the physical presence of the football. These are not explicitly permitted to change and are foundational to identifying the subjects and scene. Even if colors are made more vibrant, the base color schemes (maroon/red for WSU, white/blue/yellow for Cal) must remain identifiable.

Preservation Targets List:
- Cougar logo on the maroon helmet
- "C" logo on the black helmet
- Number "24" on the maroon jersey
- Number "89" on the white jersey
- Football held by player in maroon uniform
- Relative positioning of players (runner ahead, defender lunging)
- Maroon and white uniform color schemes
- Presence of raindrops in the air (as environmental detail)
- Green artificial turf with white yard lines

Q1:  
Thinking process: The cougar logo on the maroon helmet is the primary identifier of the Washington State Cougars team. Its distinctive shape—a white cougar head facing left—is a core visual signature that defines the team's identity. If this logo is removed or altered beyond recognition, the team affiliation becomes ambiguous. Therefore, it must be preserved even if stylized. This is a key recognition element, making its retention essential for accurate identification.  
Question: Is the white cougar logo visible on the red helmet of the player in maroon?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The "C" logo on the black helmet is the official insignia of the California Golden Bears, representing the university. It is a yellow capital "C" with a bear silhouette inside, positioned on the side of the helmet. This logo is unique to the team and critical for identifying the opponent. Any alteration that removes or distorts this symbol would misrepresent the team. Hence, it must be preserved in recognizable form.  
Question: Is the yellow "C" logo with a bear silhouette visible on the black helmet of the player in white?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The number "24" on the back of the maroon jersey is a direct identifier of the player, crucial for distinguishing him from others on the team. In sports imagery, jersey numbers are fundamental to player recognition. Removing or changing this number would misidentify the athlete. While the font might be stylized, the numeral itself must remain intact.  
Question: Is the number "24" clearly displayed on the back of the maroon jersey?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The number "89" on the white jersey identifies the defensive player and is essential for maintaining the correct player representation. Like the other number, it serves as a core identifier. Although the cartoon style may alter its appearance, the numeral must remain legible and consistent with the original.  
Question: Is the number "89" clearly displayed on the front of the white jersey?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The football is physically held by the player in maroon and is central to the action depicted. Without it, the scene loses its narrative meaning—there is no ball carrier, no play in progress. Its presence ensures continuity of the sport-specific context. Even if stylized, the object must remain identifiable as a football.  
Question: Is the football visibly held in the hands of the player in maroon?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The maroon color of the uniform is a defining feature of Washington State University's team identity. While the instruction allows for "vibrant uniform colors," this refers to enhancement, not replacement. The base color must remain maroon to preserve team identity. Changing it to another hue would misrepresent the team.  
Question: Is the player in maroon wearing a uniform primarily colored in maroon?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The white uniform with blue and gold trim is characteristic of the University of California, Berkeley. The white base with navy and gold accents is a key part of their team identity. Even with vibrancy adjustments, the core color combination must remain recognizable.  
Question: Is the player in white wearing a uniform with white base and blue/gold trim?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q8:  
Thinking process: The green artificial turf with white yard lines is a standard feature of American football fields. It provides environmental context and helps ground the scene in reality. While the background may be stylized, the field surface must remain identifiable as a football field to maintain scene logic.  
Question: Is the playing surface green artificial turf with visible white yard lines?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q9:  
Thinking process: Raindrops are visible in the air, indicating weather conditions during the game. This detail adds authenticity and environmental context. While the cartoon style may simplify them, their presence should be retained to reflect the original setting.  
Question: Are raindrops visible in the air around the players?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1
