**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject features two Eiffel Towers positioned side by side in a symmetrical composition, both rendered in the iconic wrought-iron lattice structure with golden-brown metallic tones. The left tower is fully illuminated under bright daylight, while the right one appears slightly darker but structurally identical. Both towers stand on a wide, open plaza bordered by neatly trimmed green hedges forming geometric patterns. A central water feature runs between two parallel walkways, lined with lampposts and populated by numerous small figures representing tourists. In the background, a cityscape of Parisian buildings stretches across the horizon under a clear blue sky with scattered white clouds. The scene is brightly lit, suggesting midday sunlight, and the overall aesthetic is hyper-realistic with vibrant colors and sharp details.

Thinking process:  
First, analyze the editing instructions word by word:  
- "Create a miniature 3D Paris scene illustrating two Eiffel Towers in a dual-tier snow globe." → This indicates a **complete transformation** of the scene into a **snow globe**, which implies changes to scale, perspective, framing, and environment.  
- "Scene details: On the upper tier, an intricate, antique Paris skyline emerges with metallic hues" → The **upper tier** is newly introduced; this means the original skyline can be altered or replaced.  
- "Lower tier features lush, forested gardens in vibrant greens" → The **lower tier** replaces the current garden layout, so the existing garden design may be modified.  
- "Silvery flakes drift between the tiers" → Adds dynamic elements not present in the original.  
- "The base incorporates detailed sculpted cobblestones and classic street lamp motifs" → The base is being redesigned; thus, the original ground surface and lampposts may change.  

Key points:
- The **two Eiffel Towers** are mentioned explicitly — their **presence** must be retained.
- Their **form** (iconic iron lattice) is implied as essential since they are “Eiffel Towers” — but **not specified** whether they should remain in full-scale or reduced form. However, since it's a "miniature" scene, **scale reduction** is allowed.
- The **original spatial arrangement** (side-by-side) is not required to be preserved if the new snow globe format changes layout.
- The **background cityscape** is not required to be preserved — it will be replaced with an "antique Paris skyline" in metallic hues.
- The **gardens and walkways** are not required to be preserved in form — they will be transformed into a lower-tier forested garden.
- The **people and lampposts** are not core to identity and can be changed or removed.
- The **sky and lighting** are not fixed — they will be adapted to fit the snow globe ambiance.

Allowed Changes List:  
(Specific element 1 that allows for changes): The background cityscape (can be replaced with antique metallic Paris skyline)  
(Specific element 2 that allows for changes): The garden layout and vegetation (can be transformed into forested lower-tier gardens)  
(Specific element 3 that allows for changes): The sky and lighting (can be adjusted to match snow globe atmosphere)  
(Specific element 4 that allows for changes): The size and scale of the entire scene (must become miniature)  
(Specific element 5 that allows for changes): The ground surface and lampposts (can be redesigned into cobblestone base with classic lamps)  
(Specific element 6 that allows for changes): Presence and behavior of people (can be reduced or stylized)  
(Specific element 7 that allows for changes): The presence of water feature (can be removed or reimagined)  
(Specific element 8 that allows for changes): Overall scene framing (can be enclosed in a snow globe)  
(Specific element 9 that allows for changes): Atmospheric effects (silvery flakes can be added)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements:  
- The **Eiffel Tower** is a globally recognized symbol. Its **distinctive wrought-iron lattice structure**, **triangular base**, **four-pillar support**, **central archway**, and **spire** are its core identity features. Even in a miniature or stylized version, these must be preserved to maintain recognition.  
- The **presence of two towers** is explicitly stated in the instruction — although their positioning may shift due to the snow globe format, their **dual existence** must be retained.  
- The **architectural style** (Gothic-inspired ironwork) must remain consistent — changing it to a solid block or simplified shape would lose identity.

Functional/logical association elements:  
- The **relationship between the towers and their surroundings** is not functional per se, but the **visual logic** of them being Paris landmarks must be maintained. However, since the scene is being recontextualized into a snow globe, the **physical relationship** (e.g., distance, alignment) is flexible.  
- The **structural integrity** of each tower — such as the cross-bracing, observation decks, and tapering form — must be preserved to ensure authenticity.

Non-modified element deduction:  
After excluding all allowed changes (scene, scale, background, ground, etc.), the only elements **not mentioned as changeable** are the **core structural forms** of the two Eiffel Towers. These are the **only visual content** in the original image that cannot be altered without losing the subject’s identity. Therefore, the following must be retained:
- The **lattice framework** of both towers
- The **three-level structure** with platforms
- The **tapering silhouette**
- The **spire at the top**
- The **arch-like base** supporting the central passage

Important reminder: All preservation targets must be derived from the original image and not invented. They must be **visually verifiable** in Image A.

Preservation Targets List:  
(Element 1 that should be maintained): The distinctive wrought-iron lattice structure of the Eiffel Towers  
(Element 2 that should be maintained): The triangular base with four supporting pillars  
(Element 3 that should be maintained): The central archway beneath each tower  
(Element 4 that should be maintained): The presence of two separate, upright Eiffel Towers  
(Element 5 that should be maintained): The spire at the apex of each tower  
(Element 6 that should be maintained): The three-tiered platform levels visible in the towers’ structure

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The wrought-iron lattice structure is the defining architectural feature of the Eiffel Tower. It consists of crisscrossing metal beams forming a complex grid pattern. If this texture is lost or replaced with solid surfaces, the tower becomes unrecognizable. This is a core identity feature, hence weight 3.
    Question: Does the edited image retain the intricate wrought-iron lattice structure of both Eiffel Towers?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The triangular base with four pillars is essential for structural recognition. Without this, the tower loses its iconic foundation shape. Even in a miniature format, this must be preserved to maintain identity. This is a core element, hence weight 3.
    Question: Are both towers supported by a triangular base composed of four distinct pillars?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The central archway beneath the tower is a key visual feature allowing passage underneath. Its absence would make the tower appear incomplete or incorrectly modeled. This is a critical structural detail, hence weight 2.
    Question: Is there a clearly defined archway beneath each tower through which the path passes?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The presence of two towers is explicitly stated in the instruction and visible in the original image. Removing one would violate the description and destroy the symmetry intended. This is a core compositional element, hence weight 3.
    Question: Are there exactly two Eiffel Towers present in the scene?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The spire at the top is a unique identifier of the Eiffel Tower. It is a tall, slender point extending above the main structure. Losing it would make the tower resemble other structures. This is a key identification feature, hence weight 3.
    Question: Does each tower have a pointed spire at its apex?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The three-tiered platform levels (visible as horizontal bands) are characteristic of the Eiffel Tower’s design. They mark the observation decks. Altering or removing them would distort the tower’s proportions. This is a structural detail critical to authenticity, hence weight 2.
    Question: Are there three distinct horizontal platform levels visible along the height of each tower?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
