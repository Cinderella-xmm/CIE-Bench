      "thinking_process": "The spiky, multi-tiered crown is the most iconic feature of the elephant, serving as a primary identifier of its royal or ceremonial status. Its unique shape—especially the central peak and radiating finials—is critical for recognition. If this crown is absent or significantly altered in form (e.g., flattened or simplified), the subject loses its defining character. Thus, preserving its exact silhouette and structural complexity is essential. This is a core identity feature, hence weighted at 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the spiky, multi-tiered golden crown with a central peak and ornamental base present on the elephant’s head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The chest armor is a key accessory that defines the ceremonial nature of the elephant. Its layered, geometric design with floral motifs is distinctive and not generic. Changing its shape or omitting it would break the visual continuity of the subject. Even though the material may change to metallic resin, the **structure and pattern** must remain identical. This is a functional and symbolic element tied to the subject’s identity, so it is assigned 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the elaborate golden chest armor with overlapping plates and intricate geometric/floral patterns present on the elephant’s torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The golden bands around the legs are recurring decorative elements that match the style of the crown and armor. They contribute to the overall symmetry and ceremonial aesthetic. Their presence and placement are visually significant and help anchor the design language. While minor in size, their absence would disrupt the cohesive look of the adorned elephant. They are important accessories, thus weighted at 2 points.",
      "question": "Are golden bands present around all four legs of the elephant, positioned just above the hooves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The curled-up trunk is a defining posture that conveys majesty and elegance. It is a specific gesture that distinguishes this elephant from others in similar poses. Altering the trunk’s curvature or direction would change the expression and intent of the subject. This is a core postural element tied to the original composition and emotional tone, making it critical to preserve. Weighted at 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the elephant’s trunk curled upward in a distinct spiral shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The visible right tusk is a key anatomical detail that contributes to the realism and balance of the elephant’s profile. In the original image, only one tusk is clearly visible due to the angle. Removing or altering it would make the subject appear incomplete or unnatural. While not the most iconic feature, it is a necessary detail for accurate representation. Weighted at 2 points due to importance in facial symmetry and species identification.",
      "question": "Is the right tusk visible and protruding from the upper jaw of the elephant?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The fanned-out ears are characteristic of an alert or majestic elephant. Their shape and positioning are part of the animal’s expressive anatomy. The original image shows them fully extended, contributing to the grandeur of the pose. Any reduction in size or change in shape would diminish the intended effect. This is a key physical trait, thus weighted at 2 points.",
      "question": "Are the elephant’s ears fully fanned out and extended laterally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The skin texture, particularly the wrinkles on the trunk and joints, is essential for identifying the subject as a real elephant rather than a stylized or cartoonish version. These textures provide depth and realism. Even in a miniature model, such details must be preserved to maintain fidelity. While subtle, they are crucial for visual consistency and biological accuracy. Weighted at 1 point as a detail-level element.",
      "question": "Are visible wrinkles present on the trunk, around the eyes, and at the joint areas of the legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
