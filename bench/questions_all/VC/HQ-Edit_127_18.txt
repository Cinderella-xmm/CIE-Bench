**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a large African elephant standing in profile view, facing right, positioned centrally in a savannah landscape. The elephant has prominent, curved ivory tusks, large flapping ears with visible wrinkles, a long trunk curled slightly upward at the tip, and textured gray skin with deep folds and creases across its body. Its posture is natural and grounded, with all four legs firmly planted in tall golden grass. To the left of the elephant, a single acacia tree with a wide, flat canopy of reddish-brown foliage extends horizontally over the scene. The background features a clear blue sky with voluminous white and light-yellow clouds on the right side, distant mountain ranges with snow-capped peaks on the horizon, and a vast expanse of golden dry grassland stretching into the distance. The lighting suggests late afternoon sun casting warm highlights on the elephant’s back and the grass.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction explicitly transforms the entire scene into a **diorama within a vintage travel case**, using **miniature 3D models**, **textured resin for grass**, a **tiny acacia tree for scale**, **painted clouds on the backdrop lid**, and a **brass compass as decoration**. This indicates that:

- The **form and environment** of the original scene are to be recontextualized.
- The **scale** of elements (elephant, tree, grass) will be reduced and stylized as **miniatures**.
- The **background** will be replaced or modified by a **painted backdrop inside the case lid**.
- New **decorative elements** (compass) are added.
- However, the **core identity** of the subject (elephant), **key visual characteristics** (tusks, ears, skin texture), and **scene components** (acacia tree, savannah grass, mountains) must still be **recognizable** even if miniaturized or adapted.

Thus, changes allowed include:
- Scale reduction of all elements
- Replacement of real-world materials with model equivalents (resin grass, painted clouds)
- Introduction of new objects (compass, travel case frame)
- Alteration of spatial depth via diorama construction
- Use of miniature modeling techniques

**Allowed Changes List:**
- Scale of the elephant and surrounding elements
- Material representation (e.g., real grass → textured resin)
- Background sky → painted clouds on lid
- Scene container → vintage travel case
- Addition of brass compass
- Presence of diorama framing structure
- Miniaturization of all natural elements
- Lighting and shadow effects adjusted for diorama realism

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
We now exclude the allowed changes to identify what **must remain visually consistent** based on core recognition and logical integrity.

**Core recognition elements:**  
The **African elephant** is identifiable by:
- Presence of **large, curved ivory tusks** (distinctive shape and position)
- **Large ears** with characteristic folds and size relative to head
- **Trunk morphology** (long, segmented, curled tip)
- **Skin texture** (deep wrinkles, gray coloration, patterned folds)
- **Body proportions** (massive torso, thick legs, short tail)

These features are essential to identifying the animal as an elephant, especially an African one. Changing them would misrepresent the species.

The **acacia tree** is iconic in African savannas and must retain:
- **Flat-topped canopy** with sparse branches
- **Brownish-orange bark and foliage**
- **Horizontal extension** over the scene
- **Position relative to the elephant** (to the left, partially shading it)

This tree is a key environmental marker; altering its form or removing it would break the scene’s authenticity.

The **savannah grass** must retain:
- **Tall, golden-yellow blades** swaying gently
- **Texture and density** suggesting dryness and height
- **Color gradient** from dark base to lighter tips under sunlight

Even if rendered in resin, the **visual appearance** of the grass should match the original.

The **mountains in the background** serve as geographical anchors:
- Snow-capped peaks
- Distant silhouette
- Blue-gray tone contrasting with sky

They provide depth and context; their **presence and basic shape** must be preserved.

The **sky and cloud formation** are critical for atmosphere:
- Bright blue sky
- Volumetric white and yellow clouds on the right
- Soft shadows cast by clouds

Though painted on a lid, they must replicate the **original cloud shapes and placement**.

**Functional/logical association elements:**  
- The **relative positioning** of the elephant under the acacia tree must be maintained (tree overhead, elephant beneath).
- The **direction of light** (from upper left, casting shadows to lower right) must be preserved to maintain consistency in lighting logic.
- The **overall composition** (elephant centered, tree to left, mountains far behind) must not be disrupted in layout.

**Non-modified element deduction:**  
Any detail not mentioned in the allowed changes list must be retained, including:
- Specific **wrinkle patterns** on the elephant’s skin
- **Tusk curvature and length**
- **Ear flap shape**
- **Grass blade direction**
- **Tree branch structure**
- **Mountain peak outlines**

These are not explicitly permitted to change and are necessary for visual fidelity.

**Preservation Targets List:**
- The presence and shape of the elephant's tusks
- The texture and fold pattern of the elephant’s skin
- The large ear shape and positioning
- The trunk’s curled tip and segmented structure
- The acacia tree’s flat canopy and horizontal branching
- The golden grass field with tall blades
- The distant snow-capped mountains
- The bright blue sky with specific cloud formations
- The relative position of the elephant under the acacia tree
- The lighting direction and shadow cast on the ground

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The curved shape and size of the tusks are the most distinctive features of this African elephant. They are key to species identification and must remain intact even in miniature form. If the tusks are shortened, straightened, or absent, the animal would no longer be recognizable as the same individual or species. This is a core identity feature, making it a 3-point question.
    Question: Are the elephant's tusks present and curved outward in a natural arc, extending from the mouth and tapering toward the tips?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The skin texture with deep wrinkles is a defining physical trait of elephants, particularly African elephants. It contributes to both species recognition and realistic depiction. Even in a diorama, this texture must be replicated to maintain authenticity. Loss of these folds would make the model appear artificial or incorrect. This is a core visual feature, thus weighted at 3 points.
    Question: Does the elephant's skin display deep, wrinkled folds across the forehead, neck, and body, consistent with natural elephant dermatology?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The acacia tree’s flat, umbrella-like canopy is iconic in African savannas and serves as a landmark in the image. Its unique branching structure and horizontal spread are essential for scene recognition. Removing or altering it would disrupt the environmental context. While scaled down, its shape must remain accurate. This is a critical scene element, hence 3 points.
    Question: Is the acacia tree present with a broad, flat canopy and extended horizontal branches above the elephant?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The golden grass field is a key component of the savannah setting. Its height, color, and directional flow contribute to the sense of place. Even if made of resin, the grass must resemble the original in color (golden-yellow) and density. This supports environmental coherence and is important enough to be a 2-point element.
    Question: Is the foreground covered in tall, golden-yellow grass blades that extend upward and show subtle motion from wind?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The distant snow-capped mountains provide geographic depth and contrast to the warm tones of the savannah. Their presence and basic shape (peaked, layered, blue-gray) are essential for maintaining the original landscape’s character. Though possibly simplified in a diorama, their silhouette must remain. This is a major scene element, thus 2 points.
    Question: Are snow-capped mountains visible in the background, forming a distant ridge line behind the elephant?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The elephant’s trunk is a functional and identifying feature. Its curled tip and segmented appearance are crucial for realism. Even in miniature, the curl and texture must be preserved. This is a key anatomical detail that defines the animal’s behavior and identity, so it earns 2 points.
    Question: Is the elephant's trunk curled at the tip and showing segmented ridges along its length?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The large ears of the African elephant are a distinguishing trait compared to Asian elephants. Their size, shape, and flaps are essential for correct species identification. Even in a model, they must retain their broad, fan-like form. This is a core recognition feature, warranting 3 points.
    Question: Do the elephant's ears have a large, broad, fan-shaped outline with visible internal folds and a downward flare?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q8: 
    Thinking process: The lighting direction affects shadows and highlights, contributing to depth and realism. The original image shows sunlight coming from the upper left, casting shadows to the lower right. This must be preserved in the diorama to maintain visual consistency. While lighting may be simulated, its direction must remain unchanged. This is a logical coherence element, so 2 points.
    Question: Is the lighting consistent with a source from the upper left, casting shadows on the right side of the elephant and grass?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
