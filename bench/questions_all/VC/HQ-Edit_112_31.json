      "thinking_process": "The white blaze on the horse’s face is a core identification feature. It is a distinct, narrow strip of white running vertically from the forehead to the nose, clearly visible in the original image. This marking is essential for recognizing this particular horse. If absent or relocated, the identity of the subject is compromised. Therefore, this element must be preserved exactly as seen in the original.",
      "question": "Is there a white blaze running down the center of the horse's face from the forehead to the muzzle?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The large white patch on the horse’s side is a significant part of its unique coloration pattern. This irregular white area contrasts sharply with the chestnut coat and is a key visual identifier. Removing or altering its shape or position would make the horse unrecognizable from the original.",
      "question": "Does the horse have a large white patch on its left side, extending from the shoulder toward the flank?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The horse’s posture and orientation are critical for maintaining scene coherence. In the original, the horse faces slightly left, with its head turned in that direction. This positioning establishes the viewer’s perspective and interaction with the environment. Changing the direction would disrupt the spatial logic.",
      "question": "Is the horse facing slightly to the left of the frame?",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The presence of dandelions in the foreground is a key environmental detail. They are not merely decorative; they establish the setting and scale. The original image shows numerous dandelion seed heads around the horse’s feet. Their absence would break the scene’s authenticity.",
      "question": "Are there multiple dandelion seed heads visible in the foreground, surrounding the horse’s legs?",

      "thinking_process": "The forest in the background provides depth and context. While the instruction allows for a diorama version, the **presence of a forest** behind the horse must be preserved. The silhouette of coniferous trees is visible in the original, and their inclusion maintains environmental continuity.",
      "question": "Is there a forest of tall coniferous trees visible in the background behind the horse?",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The lighting direction is crucial for mood and realism. The original image shows warm sunlight coming from the left, illuminating the horse’s mane and left flank. This directional light creates highlights and shadows that define the form. Preserving this lighting ensures visual consistency even in a stylized version.",
      "question": "Is the sunlight coming from the left side of the image, casting a golden glow on the horse’s mane and left side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The horse’s position relative to the dandelions is important. It is standing *among* them, not above or behind. This proximity indicates scale and immersion in the environment. Moving the horse away from the flowers would misrepresent the original composition.",
      "question": "Is the horse standing directly within the field of dandelions, with flower stalks reaching up to its legs?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The horse’s ears are upright and pointed, a detail that contributes to its alert expression. While the plush version may simplify them, their **presence and orientation** should be maintained to preserve the character’s demeanor.",
      "question": "Are both ears of the horse upright and pointing forward?",
