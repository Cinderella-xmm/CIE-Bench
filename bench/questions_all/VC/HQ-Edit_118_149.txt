**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a young female ballet dancer in a classical ballet studio, captured mid-pose. She stands en pointe on her right foot, with her left leg extended vertically upward in a high arabesque position, supported by the barre. Her arms are gracefully positioned—one hand gripping the wooden barre, the other extended outward—creating an elegant line. She wears a pale pink leotard, white tights, and pink pointe shoes. Her hair is styled into a tight, neat bun at the crown of her head. The setting is a traditional ballet studio with long rows of wooden barres mounted on silver brackets, tall vertical windows allowing natural light to flood in, white radiators beneath the windows, and a polished wooden floor with visible grain and plank lines. The lighting is soft and directional, casting subtle shadows that emphasize form and posture.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction states: *"Convert the ballet dancer's pose into a set of two elegant stickers: one with softened pastel colors emphasizing grace, the other with sharp geometric angles for a modern flair. Add detachable sections around her leg for dynamic layering effects, placing the stickers on a sleek, beige journal for a stylish touch."*

From this:
- The **subject’s pose** is to be transformed into **stickers**, meaning its **physical form** will be reinterpreted as graphic elements.
- The **color palette** may change: one sticker uses **softened pastel colors**, another uses **sharp geometric angles** — indicating stylization.
- **Detachable sections** are added around the leg — implying new visual components not present originally.
- The **scene context** (ballet studio) is replaced entirely: the stickers are placed on a **beige journal**, so the original background is no longer required.
- The **original environment** (barre, windows, radiators, floor) is **not preserved**; it is replaced.

Therefore, **only the core visual identity of the dancer’s pose and appearance** may be retained in stylized form, but **the scene and environmental details are allowed to change**.

**Allowed Changes List:**
- The overall form and presentation of the dancer (now as stickers)
- Color scheme (pastel vs. geometric)
- Addition of detachable layered sections
- Background/environment (studio replaced by journal)
- Lighting and atmosphere (to suit sticker design)
- Proportions and angles (stylized versions allowed)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
Despite the transformation into stickers and relocation to a journal, certain **core recognition features** must remain intact to preserve the identity of the original subject and ensure consistency with the source image. These include:

1. **Core recognition elements**: The dancer’s **pose** (arabesque), **foot position** (en pointe), **arm alignment**, and **bun hairstyle** are iconic identifiers of ballet technique and the specific moment captured. Altering these would fundamentally change the subject’s identity.
2. **Functional/logical elements**: The **relationship between body parts** (e.g., leg lifted straight up, supporting arm on barre) reflects proper ballet anatomy and balance. Even in stylized form, the **spatial logic** of the pose must be preserved to maintain realism or recognizable interpretation.
3. **Non-modified element deduction**: While the environment is changed, the **dancer’s attire** (leotard, tights, pointe shoes) and **hair style** are key to identifying her as a ballet student. These should remain visually consistent in form, even if color or texture is altered.

Even though the scene changes, the **visual essence** of the dancer — including her **posture, clothing type, and hairstyle** — must be retained in some recognizable form, especially since the instruction refers to “her leg” and “her pose,” implying continuity of identity.

**Preservation Targets List:**
- The dancer’s arabesque pose (left leg raised vertically, right leg en pointe)
- The presence of pointe shoes on both feet
- The neat bun hairstyle
- The pale pink leotard and white tights (in form, though color may shift)
- The positioning of arms (one on barre, one extended)
- The orientation of the body (side profile, facing right)

Note: The **barre**, **windows**, **radiators**, and **floor** are **not required** to be preserved because the instruction explicitly replaces the scene with a journal.

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

Q1:  
Thinking process: The arabesque pose — specifically the left leg extended vertically upward while balancing on the right foot en pointe — is the defining movement of the dancer. This posture is central to the image’s identity and ballet authenticity. If this spatial configuration is lost, the dancer’s action becomes unrecognizable as a ballet pose. It is a core identity feature and thus merits the highest weight.  
Question: Is the dancer’s left leg extended vertically upward in a full arabesque, with the right foot en pointe?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3

Q2:  
Thinking process: The pointe shoes are essential to identifying the dancer as a classical ballerina. Their presence, shape (with ribbons wrapped around the ankle), and placement (on both feet) are key indicators of ballet training and performance. Even if stylized, their form must be preserved. Loss would misrepresent the subject’s role.  
Question: Are both feet wearing pink pointe shoes with visible ribbons wrapped around the ankles?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3

Q3:  
Thinking process: The neat bun hairstyle is a signature look for ballet dancers, especially in formal training settings. It is a functional and symbolic element of discipline and uniformity. Its retention ensures the dancer remains identifiable within the ballet context. Though color may shift, the shape and placement must remain.  
Question: Is the dancer’s hair styled into a tight, round bun at the top of her head?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2

Q4:  
Thinking process: The pale pink leotard and white tights are standard ballet attire and contribute to the dancer’s identity. While the instruction allows color modification (e.g., pastel tones), the **form** of the outfit — sleeveless leotard with tights — must remain to maintain coherence with the original subject. Changing it to something like shorts or a dress would break identity.  
Question: Does the dancer wear a sleeveless, fitted pink leotard paired with white tights?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2

Q5:  
Thinking process: The arm positioning — one hand gripping the barre, the other extended sideways — defines the balance and elegance of the pose. This alignment is critical to the composition and function of the movement. Even in sticker form, the spatial relationship between arms must reflect the original gesture.  
Question: Is one arm extended forward and slightly out to the side, while the other grips the barre?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2

Q6:  
Thinking process: The side profile orientation of the dancer — facing toward the right side of the frame — is a key compositional element that establishes depth and direction. Reversing or altering this orientation would change the narrative and visual flow of the pose. It supports the logical structure of the scene.  
Question: Is the dancer facing to the right side of the image, with her body in a side profile view?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1

Q7:  
Thinking process: The visible seam along the back of the leotard (common in dancewear) is a minor detail but contributes to the realism and specificity of the costume. While not critical to identity, its absence could make the garment appear generic or improperly rendered. It supports visual coherence.  
Question: Is there a visible seam running down the center back of the leotard?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1
