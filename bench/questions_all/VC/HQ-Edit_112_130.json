      "thinking_process": "The violin is the central object defining the subject’s action. Its presence and correct orientation are essential for identifying the scene as one of musical performance. If replaced or misaligned, the core narrative collapses. The violin must retain its shape, placement under the chin, and string contact with the bow. This is a core identity element because without it, the scene loses its primary purpose.",
      "question": "Is the violin clearly present under the woman’s chin, held by her left hand, with the bow drawn across the strings by her right hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The woman’s posture—specifically the angle of her body and the alignment of her arms—is critical for conveying the act of playing the violin. Altering the arm positions (e.g., swapping hands or removing the bow) would break the functional logic of the scene. This is a key functional element that supports the action.",
      "question": "Are both arms positioned correctly to support violin playing—left arm holding the instrument, right arm moving the bow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The woman’s facial expression—eyes closed, lips gently parted, serene demeanor—is a key emotional identifier in the original image. It conveys tranquility and immersion in music. While the style may change, this expression is part of the original character’s identity and must be preserved to maintain continuity in mood and intent.",
      "question": "Does the woman have her eyes closed and a calm, focused facial expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The standing posture of the woman—upright, slightly turned toward the viewer—is a compositional anchor. It ensures the viewer’s focus remains on her and the violin. While the clothing may change, the spatial orientation of the body must remain consistent to preserve the original framing and balance.",
      "question": "Is the woman standing upright with her body slightly angled toward the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The interaction between the bow and the violin strings is a detail-level but necessary functional element. The bow must be shown in contact with the strings, suggesting motion. Losing this detail would imply the violin is not being played, undermining the scene’s purpose.",
      "question": "Is the bow visibly in contact with the strings of the violin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The woman’s long dark hair flowing over her shoulders is a distinctive visual feature contributing to her identity and aesthetic. Though not central to function, it is a recognizable detail that helps distinguish her from other figures and maintains continuity in appearance.",
      "question": "Does the woman have long, dark hair flowing down her back and over her shoulders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
