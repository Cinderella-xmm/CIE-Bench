      "thinking_process": "The seated pose with the left hand under the chin is the most iconic and distinguishing feature of the subject in the original image. It defines the contemplative mood and serves as a core visual anchor. Losing this gesture would fundamentally alter the subject’s identity and emotional expression, making it unrecognizable as the same figure. Therefore, this is a critical identification element with a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the gorilla depicted in a seated pose with its left hand resting under its chin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The facial structure, particularly the prominent brow ridge, wide nose, and strong jawline, are essential for identifying the subject as a silverback gorilla. These features distinguish it from other primates and are biologically accurate markers. Altering them would result in misidentification. Hence, they are core recognition elements with a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Does the gorilla have a prominent brow ridge, wide nose, and strong jawline consistent with a silverback gorilla?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The silver saddle — the patch of lighter fur across the back and shoulders — is a defining trait of mature male gorillas. Even though the instruction allows changing color to brown, the **shape and location** of this feature must be preserved to maintain species accuracy. Its absence would make the figure appear juvenile or incorrect. Thus, this is a key biological identifier with a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Is there a distinct patch resembling a silver saddle located across the back and shoulders of the gorilla?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The position of the gorilla on a horizontal platform (the log) is crucial for maintaining spatial logic and compositional balance. Even if the log is transformed into a wooden surface, the subject must remain seated on a raised, horizontal base to preserve the original scene's grounding. Removing this would disrupt the environmental relationship and make the figure appear floating. This is an important structural element with a weight of 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the gorilla positioned on a horizontal surface that resembles a log or platform?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The right arm resting on the knee is a secondary but significant detail that contributes to the overall posture and balance of the figure. It helps define the seated position and adds realism. While less critical than the hand-under-chin gesture, its absence would affect the naturalness of the pose. It is a minor but coherent detail, hence assigned 1 point.",
      "question": "Is the gorilla’s right arm resting on its right knee?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The direction of the gaze — forward and slightly downward — is a subtle but important cue for conveying contemplation. It aligns with the hand-under-chin pose and contributes to the emotional tone. Changing this would alter the intended mood. Although not a primary identifier, it supports narrative consistency and is therefore a key detail worth 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the gorilla’s gaze directed forward and slightly downward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The instruction specifies simplifying the background to an etched wooden surface with scattered leaves. However, the **presence of leaf-like forms** is required to capture the forest essence. These must be present in the background, even if stylized, to fulfill the directive. Their absence would violate the instruction and lose thematic context. Thus, this is a necessary scene element with a weight of 2 points.",
      "question": "Are there leaf-shaped elements present in the background, even if stylized or etched?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
