      "thinking_process": "The circular shape with a central hole is the defining geometric feature of a donut. If this shape is altered (e.g., filled in, reshaped into a sphere), the object loses its identity as a donut. This is a core recognition element, essential for identifying the subject. Losing it would make the character unrecognizable as a donut, even in cartoon form. Therefore, it must be preserved.",
      "question": "Is the donut-shaped object retaining a circular form with a central hole?",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The golden-brown color of the baked dough is a key identifier of the donut’s base material. In the original image, this color distinguishes it from other types of pastries. Even in pop-art style, changing it to bright red or blue would misrepresent the original object. This color is essential for maintaining visual continuity and recognition.",
      "question": "Does the donut retain its golden-brown baked color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The coarse granulated sugar coating is a distinctive texture that differentiates this donut from glazed or frosted varieties. Its presence is a core visual trait in the original image. If replaced with smooth icing or omitted entirely, the donut’s identity as a cinnamon-sugar variety is lost. Thus, this texture must be preserved in some form, even if stylized.",
      "question": "Is the surface of the donut covered in visible coarse granulated sugar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The sugar coating’s texture includes individual granules that are visibly scattered across the surface. This granular quality is not just decorative but diagnostic — it confirms the type of donut. If the texture is smoothed out or replaced with uniform shading, the key detail is lost. This level of detail supports authenticity and should be maintained.",
      "question": "Are there visible individual sugar granules on the donut’s surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The ring-like form, where the dough forms a continuous loop with a hole, is fundamental to the donut’s structure. Even if limbs are added, the body must still reflect this ring shape. If the donut becomes a solid disk or irregular blob, it fails to represent the original. This structural integrity is crucial for recognition.",
      "question": "Is the donut’s body formed as a continuous ring with a central opening?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
