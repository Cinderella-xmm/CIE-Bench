Description of reference image: The subject is the Leeds Parkway Hotel, a multi-story building with a Tudor-style architectural design. The structure features red brickwork on the lower levels and white-painted timber-framed upper sections with dark wooden beams forming a distinctive half-timbered pattern. The roof is covered in dark brown tiles, with dormer windows protruding from the sloped surfaces. The central entrance is sheltered by a modern light blue awning bearing the sign "Leeds Parkway Hotel" and the Mercure logo in red. Below the awning are double wooden doors with glass panels. To the left of the entrance is a black arched door set into a brick wall, flanked by rectangular planters filled with colorful flowers. Additional flower boxes line the window ledges above the ground floor. The foreground includes a paved parking area with yellow road markings. The sky is partly cloudy with patches of blue.

Thinking process: First, analyze the instructions that clearly state what can be changed:  
- "Render the building in paper-cut style with sharp, angular edges" → This indicates the **form and texture** of the building can be stylized, but not its **identity or layout**.  
- "Emphasizing Tudor elements" → The Tudor architectural features (half-timbering, gabled roofs) must still be recognizable, even if stylized.  
- "Enhance window frames and plant motifs with gold foil accents" → Window frames and plants may be altered in material appearance, but their **presence and position** must remain.  
- "Depict the entrance awning in bold crimson hues" → Color of the awning changes, but its **position and function** must stay.  
- "Print on textured cream-colored paper with geometric arch borders" → Background medium and framing change, but **the scene content** remains unchanged.  
- "Frame in simple borderless framing for a modern postcard look" → Framing is added post-production; does not affect original visual content.

Allowed Changes List:  
(Specific element 1 that allows for changes): The overall rendering style (paper-cut aesthetic with angular edges)  
(Specific element 2 that allows for changes): The color of the entrance awning (to crimson)  
(Specific element 3 that allows for changes): Addition of gold foil accents to window frames and plant motifs  
(Specific element 4 that allows for changes): Texture and surface finish of the building (e.g., paper-like cutouts)  
(Specific element 5 that allows for changes): Printing medium and border design (textured cream paper with geometric arches)  

Step 2 – Determine the elements that should remain unchanged

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements: The hotel’s identity hinges on its **Tudor-style architecture**, particularly the **black-and-white half-timbered gables**, **brickwork base**, and **distinctive roofline**. These define the building's character and must remain identifiable despite stylistic changes. The **Mercure branding** and **"Leeds Parkway Hotel" signage** are critical for functional identification and must retain their placement and legibility.  

Functional/logical association elements: The **entrance doors under the awning** serve as the primary access point—changing their location or form would disrupt logical spatial coherence. The **planters with flowers** along the base and windowsills contribute to the aesthetic and environmental context; removing them would alter the scene’s realism and balance.  

Non-modified element deduction: Although the style is to be transformed into paper-cut art, the **relative positions** of key components (e.g., the arched black door to the left, the symmetrical windows, the dormer windows on the roof) must remain consistent to preserve spatial logic. The **flower arrangements** and **window grid patterns** must remain present and correctly placed, even if enhanced with foil.  

Preservation Targets List:  
(The presence and arrangement of the half-timbered gable ends)  
(The positioning and shape of the black arched door on the left side of the building)  
(The location and text of the "Leeds Parkway Hotel" sign on the awning)  
(The placement of the flower planters along the base and window sills)  
(The configuration of the windows, including dormers and bay windows)  
(The overall layout of the building, including the central entrance and adjacent wings)  

Q1:  
Thinking process: The half-timbered gable ends are the defining architectural feature of the Tudor style, immediately identifying the building as such. Their presence and triangular shape are essential for recognition. Even if stylized, they must remain visually identifiable as part of the façade. Losing this feature would make the building unrecognizable as a Tudor-style hotel.  
Question: Are the black-and-white half-timbered gable ends visible and positioned at the top of the central and right-side sections of the building?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The black arched door on the left side is a unique structural element that distinguishes this part of the building from others. It is not merely decorative but serves as a key visual anchor in the composition. Its removal or relocation would misrepresent the building’s layout.  
Question: Is there a black arched door located on the left side of the building, embedded within the brick wall below the window ledge?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The "Leeds Parkway Hotel" sign is the primary identifier of the establishment. Its placement under the awning and legibility are crucial for functional recognition. While the color may change, the text and its location must remain intact.  
Question: Is the sign reading "Leeds Parkway Hotel" present beneath the entrance awning, aligned horizontally above the main doors?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The flower planters along the base and window sills are recurring decorative elements that contribute to the building’s charm and symmetry. They are not merely background details but part of the intentional landscaping. Their absence would reduce visual completeness and break continuity.  
Question: Are there rectangular planters with colorful flowers positioned along the base of the building, both in front of the black arched door and near the entrance steps?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The windows, especially the dormer windows on the roof and the bay window on the right wing, are key architectural features that define the building’s silhouette and proportion. Their grid patterns and placements are consistent with Tudor design and must remain to preserve authenticity.  
Question: Are there multiple windows with white frames arranged in grid patterns, including dormer windows on the roof and a bay window on the right side of the building?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The entrance doors under the awning are the functional entry point and a central focus of the image. Their position directly beneath the awning and their double-door configuration are essential for spatial logic. Changing their location or form would mislead viewers about the building’s layout.  
Question: Are the main entrance doors located centrally under the awning, consisting of two wooden doors with glass panels?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The brickwork base of the building, particularly the red brick walls and the archway around the black door, defines the lower portion of the structure. This material contrast between brick and timber is a core visual feature of Tudor architecture. Altering its texture or removing it would distort the building’s identity.  
Question: Is the lower section of the building constructed from red brick, with an arched opening housing the black door?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2
