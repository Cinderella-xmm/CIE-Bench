**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

Description of reference image:  
The subject is a traditional Japanese-style tea set placed on a bamboo mat in front of a shoji screen window. The teapot is large, rounded, with a woven rattan handle and a small bamboo whistle attached to the lid. It features an intricate floral design with a prominent peony, white chrysanthemum-like flowers, and green leaves painted across its surface. The texture of the teapot appears to be a fine mesh or textured ceramic finish, resembling hand-woven fabric. The spout and lid are smooth and off-white, contrasting with the detailed body. Four teacups surround the teapot: one larger bowl-shaped cup on a saucer, two smaller cups with floral patterns matching the teapot, and one tiny cup with similar motifs. All contain amber-colored tea. A pair of dark wooden chopsticks rests on a white rectangular rest beside the cups. The background consists of a wooden-framed shoji screen with translucent paper panels arranged in a grid pattern, allowing soft daylight to filter through. The entire scene is set on a light brown bamboo tatami mat, which shows clear horizontal slats and natural texture.

Thinking process:  
First, analyze the editing instructions word by word:  
- “Transform the tea set into a Japanese tea brand packaging design” → implies complete reimagining of the functional form of the tea set into a commercial product package.  
- “Convert the teapot into a cylindrical container” → explicitly changes the shape of the teapot from spherical/rounded to cylindrical; this is a structural transformation allowed.  
- “Emboss floral patterns in golden foil” → changes material finish and technique (from painted to embossed gold), but retains the floral motif as a core visual element.  
- “Redesign cups as nested stackable teacups with decorative lids” → alters form and function of cups; they are no longer open bowls but now have lids and stacking capability.  
- “Include branding across the top with Japanese calligraphy” → adds new text elements not present originally; allowed change.  
- “Add a bamboo motif along the side” → introduces a new decorative element; allowed.  
- “Presenting on a flat white surface for a refined, elegant look” → changes background entirely from tatami mat and shoji screen to a plain white surface; environment is replaced.

Thus, the following elements are **allowed to change**:
- Shape of the teapot (from rounded to cylindrical)
- Material finish of floral patterns (painted → embossed gold foil)
- Form and function of the cups (open → stacked with lids)
- Background environment (tatami mat + shoji screen → flat white surface)
- Addition of calligraphy branding
- Addition of bamboo motif decoration
- Overall layout and presentation style

Allowed Changes List:  
(Specific element 1 that allows for changes): Teapot shape (from rounded to cylindrical)  
(Specific element 2 that allows for changes): Cup form (from open bowls to stackable cups with lids)  
(Specific element 3 that allows for changes): Floral pattern rendering (from painted to embossed gold foil)  
(Specific element 4 that allows for changes): Background environment (tatami mat and shoji screen → flat white surface)  
(Specific element 5 that allows for changes): Addition of Japanese calligraphy branding  
(Specific element 6 that allows for changes): Addition of bamboo motif along side  
(Specific element 7 that allows for changes): Chopstick placement and rest (may be removed or repositioned)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements:  
- The **floral design** (peony, chrysanthemum, leaves) is central to the identity of the original tea set. Even though it will be transformed into embossed gold foil, the **presence and composition of the floral arrangement** must remain recognizable—specifically, the **large pink peony**, **white clustered flower**, and **surrounding foliage**—as these define the artistic theme and aesthetic of the original object.  
- The **texture of the teapot's surface**—a subtle mesh-like or woven fabric texture—is unique and contributes to the artisanal quality of the piece. While the material may change, the **visual impression of a finely textured surface** should be preserved in form if not in medium.  
- The **color palette** of the floral design—soft pinks, whites, greens, and orange-red berries—is distinctive and tied to traditional Japanese aesthetics. Though gold foil may overlay it, the underlying **color scheme and arrangement** must be retained for continuity.  

Functional/logical association elements:  
- The **relationship between the teapot and cups** as part of a cohesive tea set must remain logical. Although forms change, the **intended use as a tea-serving ensemble** should still be implied.  
- The **presence of tea in all containers** must be maintained—this is essential for identifying the purpose of the objects. Even if the cups become closed lids, tea must still be visible or implied inside.  

Non-modified element deduction:  
- The **original floral motif’s composition** (e.g., peony centered with white cluster to the left, leafy branches extending upward) cannot be altered without losing identity.  
- The **proportional balance** of the floral elements relative to the teapot’s size must be preserved.  
- The **type of flowers**—peony and chrysanthemum-like bloom—are culturally significant and visually defining. Their **shapes and positions** must remain consistent.  
- The **presence of tea** in each vessel must be retained, even if the vessels are redesigned.  

Preservation Targets List:  
(Element 1 that should be maintained): The presence of a large pink peony flower on the teapot  
(Element 2 that should be maintained): The presence of a white clustered flower adjacent to the peony  
(Element 3 that should be maintained): The presence of green leaves and stems surrounding the floral group  
(Element 4 that should be maintained): The color scheme of the floral design (pink, white, green, orange-red berries)  
(Element 5 that should be maintained): The presence of tea in all four cups  
(Element 6 that should be maintained): The overall floral arrangement’s spatial composition (centered on the teapot body, symmetrical layout)  
(Element 7 that should be maintained): The texture of the teapot surface (fine mesh or woven appearance)  
(Element 8 that should be maintained): The presence of multiple cups forming a tea set (four distinct vessels)

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The large pink peony is the most dominant and identifiable floral feature in the original image. Its shape—layered petals with a defined center—and its position on the teapot’s body are critical to the visual identity of the tea set. If this flower is omitted, replaced, or significantly altered in form, the essence of the original design is lost. This makes it a core recognition element with a weight of 3 points.
    Question: Is there a large pink peony flower prominently displayed on the body of the teapot?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The white clustered flower, resembling a chrysanthemum or hydrangea, is positioned to the left of the peony and forms a key part of the balanced floral composition. Its presence contributes to the symmetry and richness of the design. Removing or replacing it would disrupt the intended aesthetic and reduce recognizability. Thus, it is an important element with a weight of 2 points.
    Question: Is there a white clustered flower located next to the pink peony on the teapot?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The green leaves and stems surrounding the flowers provide structural framing and enhance the botanical realism of the design. These are not merely decorative—they anchor the floral elements within a natural context. Their absence would make the design appear incomplete or artificial. They are essential for visual coherence and thus warrant a weight of 2 points.
    Question: Are there green leaves and stems extending from the base of the flowers on the teapot?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The color scheme—soft pink, white, green, and orange-red berries—is integral to the cultural and aesthetic identity of the tea set. Even if rendered in gold foil, the underlying colors must be preserved to maintain consistency with the original. Altering this palette would fundamentally change the visual character of the design. This is a key detail with a weight of 2 points.
    Question: Do the floral elements include pink, white, green, and orange-red berry-like accents?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The presence of tea in each of the four cups is a functional and visual necessity. It confirms the object’s purpose and maintains narrative continuity. Even if the cups are redesigned with lids, the tea must still be visible or implied. Losing this would break the logic of the scene. This is a core functional element with a weight of 3 points.
    Question: Is amber-colored tea visible in all four cups?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The spatial arrangement of the floral elements—centered on the teapot, with the peony and white flower forming a balanced cluster—is crucial for visual harmony. Any significant shift in positioning (e.g., moving the peony to the side) would distort the original composition. This layout is a secondary but meaningful design feature, so it is assigned a weight of 1 point.
    Question: Are the floral elements centrally located on the body of the teapot?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}
{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The textured surface of the teapot—resembling a fine mesh or woven fabric—is a distinctive tactile and visual feature that sets it apart from smooth ceramics. While the material may change, the visual impression of texture must be preserved to retain authenticity. This is a detail-level element but important for fidelity, hence a weight of 1 point.
    Question: Does the teapot surface exhibit a fine mesh or woven-texture appearance?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}
{
    Q8: 
    Thinking process: The presence of four distinct cups—of varying sizes and shapes—establishes the tea set as a complete service. Even if redesigned as stackable units, the number and conceptual grouping must remain. Reducing or increasing the count would alter the functional narrative. This is a minor but necessary detail with a weight of 1 point.
    Question: Are there exactly four cups present in the scene?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
