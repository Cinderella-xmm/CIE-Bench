      "thinking_process": "The floral and paisley motifs are the defining decorative elements of the saree, directly tied to its cultural and aesthetic identity. Their presence, arrangement, and symmetry are key to recognizing the garment as a traditional Indian bridal or ceremonial saree. Even when transformed into stone carvings, their exact design must be preserved to maintain authenticity. Losing these patterns would result in a loss of cultural specificity and visual coherence. Thus, this is a core identity element.",
      "question": "Are the floral and paisley embroidery patterns present and accurately replicated as carved reliefs on the saree?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The drape of the saree—especially the pallu over the left shoulder and the pleats at the front—is a structural hallmark of how the garment is worn. It defines the silhouette and distinguishes it from other garments. Even if rendered in stone, the way the fabric flows over the body must be preserved to maintain the garment's identity. Altering this drape would fundamentally change the subject’s appearance and recognition.",
      "question": "Is the saree draped with the pallu over the left shoulder and the pleats aligned vertically at the front?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "thinking_process": "The choker necklace is a prominent accessory that contributes to the regal appearance of the figure. Its placement on the neck and its layered, ornate structure are visually distinct. Even as a carved detail, its position and form must be preserved to maintain the sense of adornment and cultural significance. Removing or relocating it would disrupt the balance and symbolism of the attire.",
      "question": "Is the multi-layered choker necklace positioned around the neck, with dangling elements visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The bracelet on the right wrist is a key accessory that complements the choker and reinforces the theme of royal adornment. Its placement on the wrist is fixed and functional in the original image. In the stone version, it must remain in the same location and retain its ornate shape to preserve the visual logic of the jewelry set.",
      "question": "Is the bracelet present on the right wrist, matching the design and placement of the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "thinking_process": "The ring on the right hand is a small but significant detail that completes the jewelry ensemble. Its presence on the index finger is specific and contributes to the overall elegance. Even in stone, its position must be preserved to maintain consistency with the original pose and adornment logic.",
      "question": "Is the ring present on the right hand, specifically on the index finger?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The border of the saree features a distinct pattern and width that frames the garment. This border is a signature element of high-end sarees and must be preserved in both position and design. In the stone version, it should appear as a carved edge along the pallu and lower hem.",
      "question": "Is the wide, patterned border of the saree preserved along the edges of the pallu and hem?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The overall silhouette of the figure—its upright stance, proportionate limbs, and balanced posture—is essential to maintaining the dignity and elegance of the original mannequin. While the pose may shift to a classical Indian style, the general human form and proportions must remain consistent to ensure the subject remains recognizable as a human figure in formal attire.",
      "question": "Does the figure maintain a standing, upright posture with proportional limbs and a balanced silhouette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
