Description of reference image: The subject is a large, ornate ceramic vase placed centrally on a wooden pedestal with carved detailing. The vase features a classical design with gilded scrollwork handles, a richly decorated body divided into three panels: the central panel depicts a golden relief of a female figure in flowing robes holding flowers, flanked by two painted floral scenes in vibrant colors (orange, blue, red) on a white background. The neck of the vase has intricate blue and gold patterns, and the base is adorned with ornamental molding. The vase contains a lush bouquet of wildflowers, including white daisies with yellow centers, purple delphiniums, pink poppies, blue cornflowers, lavender sprigs, and various green foliage. The arrangement overflows from the vase, spilling slightly onto the surface of the pedestal, where a few scattered petals and small flowers lie—specifically a pink poppy and some blue blossoms. The background is dark and muted, enhancing the contrast and focus on the vase and flowers. The lighting is soft and directional, creating depth and highlighting textures.

Thinking process: First, analyze the instructions that clearly state what can be changed:  
- "Transform the ornate vase into a crystal sculpture" → the material, texture, and surface finish of the vase are allowed to change.  
- "Replace the floral art with etched crystal patterns in abstract floral designs" → the artwork on the vase’s surface is to be replaced; thus, the original painted/relief imagery is not required to remain.  
- "Convert the flowers into an arrangement of delicately carved pastel-colored crystal blossoms" → the actual flowers (their type, color, form, and material) are to be replaced entirely.  
- "Place the entire composition on a minimalist mirrored pedestal" → the base/platform is to be changed from wooden to mirrored and minimalist in style.  

Therefore, the following elements are **allowed to change**:  
- Material and surface of the vase (ceramic → crystal)  
- Artwork on the vase (painted and relief figures → etched abstract patterns)  
- Type, material, and appearance of the flowers (organic wildflowers → crystal blossoms)  
- Base/pedestal (wooden with carvings → mirrored and minimalist)  

However, the **instructions do not specify any retention of the original scene structure**, such as the position of the vase, the general composition of the still life, or the overall spatial layout. But since the editing instruction describes a transformation of the *entire* composition while preserving its conceptual form ("the entire composition"), we infer that the **overall placement** and **relative positioning** of the vase and flowers must be preserved in form, even if materials change. This includes the **overflowing bouquet** and **scattered petals on the surface**.

Allowed Changes List:  
- Material and surface texture of the vase (ceramic → crystal)  
- Decorative artwork on the vase (classical painted and relief panels → abstract etched patterns)  
- Nature and material of the flowers (organic → crystal)  
- Color and texture of the flowers (natural hues → pastel, translucent)  
- Pedestal material and design (wooden carved → mirrored minimalist)  
- Background tone (can be adjusted to suit new reflective surface)  

Step 2 – Determine the elements that should remain unchanged

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements:  
The original vase has specific **iconic visual features** due to its classical design and artistic decoration. However, the instruction explicitly replaces the floral art and transforms the vase into crystal, so the **specific painted scenes and the golden female figure** are **not required to be retained**. Thus, they are not core identity elements under this transformation. That said, the **overall shape and structural form** of the vase — particularly its **three-panel body, dual scrolled handles, and decorative neck and foot** — are not mentioned as being altered. Since the instruction says “transform into a crystal sculpture using clear faceted surfaces to mimic the original shape,” the **silhouette and proportion** of the vase must be preserved. Therefore, the **basic shape and structural outline** of the vase are core identity elements, even though material and surface details may change.

Functional/logical association elements:  
The vase functions as a container for the floral arrangement. The instruction specifies replacing the flowers with crystal blossoms but maintains the **concept of an overflowing bouquet**, implying that the **spatial relationship** between the vase and the flowers must be preserved — i.e., the flowers must still appear to emerge from the vase and spill outward. This logical function (container-content relationship) must be retained.

Non-modified element deduction:  
After excluding all allowed changes, the remaining unmentioned elements include:  
- The **position of the vase** on the pedestal (centered)  
- The **presence of scattered flowers** on the pedestal surface (pink poppy and blue blooms)  
- The **general composition** of the still life: vase centered, flowers radiating out, slight asymmetry in bouquet  
- The **dark background** (implied by contrast, though not strictly required)  
- The **lighting direction** (soft, directional, highlighting volume) — though not specified, it supports visibility of details and is likely preserved in spirit  

These are not explicitly changed in the instruction and are essential for visual coherence. While the pedestal changes, the **placement of the vase relative to the frame** and the **spatial overflow of flowers** are critical for maintaining the original scene’s intent.

Preservation Targets List:  
- The overall shape and silhouette of the vase (three-panel body, dual handles, neck, and foot)  
- The presence of an overflowing bouquet emerging from the vase  
- The scattered flowers on the pedestal surface (including a pink poppy and blue blossoms)  
- The central positioning of the vase within the frame  
- The spatial relationship between the vase and the spilled flowers (some lying on the surface)

    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The silhouette of the vase — specifically its three-panel body, twin scrolled handles, and flared neck — defines its architectural identity. Even though it is transformed into crystal, the instruction requires mimicking the original shape. If this form is lost, the object would no longer resemble the original vase, undermining the continuity of the composition. This is a core structural feature, essential for recognizing the transformed object as a derivation of the original.

    Choices: Yes, No

    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The instruction specifies that the flowers are to be converted into crystal blossoms but does not alter their spatial behavior. The original image shows an overflowing bouquet that spills beyond the vase. Retaining this dynamic ensures functional consistency — the vase remains a vessel for flowers, even if they are now crystal. Losing this overflow would disrupt the logical and visual narrative of abundance.
    Question: Does the bouquet extend beyond the rim of the vase, creating an overflowing effect?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The scattered flowers on the pedestal — specifically the pink poppy and blue blossoms — are part of the original composition’s realism and detail. They reinforce the idea of natural movement and imperfection. Though the instruction does not mention them directly, their absence would break visual coherence and suggest a sterile, artificial setting inconsistent with the original mood. Their presence is a key detail anchoring the scene.
    Question: Are there scattered flowers on the surface of the pedestal, including at least one pink poppy and blue blooms?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The vase is centrally positioned in the frame, which is crucial for the balance and symmetry of the still-life composition. Changing its position would shift the visual focus and alter the intended aesthetic. Although the pedestal changes, the central placement is implied by the instruction to preserve the "entire composition." This is a key compositional element.
    Question: Is the vase positioned centrally on the pedestal within the frame?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The spatial relationship between the vase and the spilled flowers — particularly that some flowers lie directly on the pedestal surface — is essential for maintaining the sense of realism and depth. This detail contributes to the illusion of a natural, lived-in moment. Even if the flowers are now crystal, their physical location relative to the vase must remain consistent to preserve the original scene’s logic.
    Question: Do some of the flowers rest directly on the surface of the pedestal, separate from the main bouquet?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
