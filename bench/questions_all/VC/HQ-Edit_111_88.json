      "thinking_process": "The dynamic pose—specifically the right leg lifted high with knee bent and foot pointed downward, combined with the left arm reaching upward and the body leaning forward—is the core identity feature of the dancer. It defines the action and energy of the scene. Losing this pose would make the figure unrecognizable as a dancer in motion. This is a structural and kinetic identifier, essential for continuity. Therefore, it carries a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the dancer’s right leg raised high with the knee bent and foot pointed down, and is her left arm extended upward while her body leans forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The beaded top and patterned skirt are central to the cultural identity and visual richness of the subject. Their specific design—horizontal stripes of red, yellow, blue, and orange in geometric patterns—is a key identifying feature. Even if stylized, their presence and basic structure must be preserved. Removing or altering them fundamentally changes the subject’s cultural representation. This is a critical accessory element, thus weighted at 3 points.",
      "question": "Are the beaded top and patterned skirt visibly present on the dancer, maintaining their distinct horizontal striped and geometric designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The multiple bracelets, anklets, necklaces, and headband are signature adornments that define the dancer’s traditional attire. Their layered, multicolored appearance is a core detail that contributes to the visual complexity and authenticity of the character. While their texture may change to glass-like, their existence and placement must be preserved. This is an important accessory detail affecting cultural accuracy, hence 2 points.",
      "question": "Are there multiple bracelets on both wrists, anklets on both ankles, a multi-layered necklace around the neck, and a headband on the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The presence of at least five elephants in the background is a key environmental element that establishes the setting. Their number and distribution (e.g., cluster on the left, isolated ones on the right) contribute to the narrative depth and realism of the village scene. Although they may be stylized, their existence and approximate count must be maintained for consistency. This is an important scene element, thus 2 points.",
      "question": "Are there at least five elephants visible in the background, positioned near the huts and scattered across the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The presence of at least three human figures in the background—some seated, some standing—adds social context to the scene. Their inclusion is necessary to convey a village setting. Even if stylized, their number and general positions (left side, right side, center) must be preserved to maintain logical coherence. This is a secondary but significant scene element, therefore 2 points.",
      "question": "Are there at least three human figures visible in the background, with some seated and some standing near the huts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The two thatched huts with conical roofs are iconic architectural elements of the African village. Their presence anchors the scene geographically. Even if transformed into curvilinear shapes, their basic form and number must be preserved. This is a key environmental feature that helps identify the setting, so it is weighted at 2 points.",
      "question": "Are there two distinct thatched-roof huts visible in the background, one on the left and one on the right side of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The acacia trees with flat, umbrella-shaped canopies are characteristic of African savanna landscapes. Their presence reinforces the geographical setting. Although their forms may be stylized into curvilinear shapes, their silhouette and placement in the background must remain recognizable. This is a minor but coherent detail contributing to environmental authenticity, thus 1 point.",
      "question": "Are there at least two acacia trees with flat, rounded canopies visible in the background behind the huts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 1
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "thinking_process": "The dancer’s position in the foreground, with the village elements in the midground, establishes the spatial hierarchy of the composition. This layout is essential for narrative clarity and visual focus. Altering this relationship would disrupt the viewer’s understanding of the scene. Though not a core identity feature, it is a critical compositional element, hence 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the dancer positioned in the foreground, clearly separated from the background elements like huts and elephants?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
