      "thinking_process": "The woman’s attire, particularly the **colorful, patterned dress with symbolic motifs**, is the core identifier of her cultural identity. The specific combination of orange, green, yellow, and red with circular and floral designs is unique to the visual style of the original image. If these patterns are removed or replaced with unrelated designs, the cultural authenticity is lost, making the subject unrecognizable within the context of the instruction. This is a key identity feature, hence weight 3.",

Even if abstracted, their **presence and layered structure** must be preserved to fulfill the artistic intent. Their removal would violate the core directive about highlighting jewelry.

It is not merely decorative but part of the cultural attire. Its absence or replacement with a different head covering (e.g., hat, scarf) would alter the subject’s identity. Therefore, it must be preserved, even in stylized form. Weight: 3.",

While the instruction allows abstraction, the **act of leaning** implies a physical support, and the staff is essential to that pose. Its removal would change the intended gesture and undermine the scene’s logic. This is a functional element tied to posture, thus weight 2.",

While the background can be changed, if the hut is included, its **basic structure** — rounded mud walls and thatched roof — must be retained.
