Description of reference image: The subject is a woman with long, dark curly hair that falls over her shoulders, styled naturally with soft waves. She has a warm complexion and is smiling gently at the camera, with her head slightly tilted forward. Her facial features include well-defined eyebrows, almond-shaped brown eyes, and full lips with a natural pink tone. She wears small gold hoop earrings in both ears. She is dressed in a burnt orange long-sleeved button-up blouse with a V-neckline and a structured collar; the blouse has visible buttons down the front and puffed sleeves that taper into fitted cuffs. The fabric appears smooth with subtle vertical creases indicating lightweight material. She pairs this with high-waisted, tailored green trousers featuring a flat front, belt loops, and a visible waistband seam. Her right hand is placed casually in the front pocket of the trousers, with fingers partially visible. The background is a solid, neutral beige tone without any texture or pattern, providing a clean and minimalistic backdrop. The lighting is even and soft, highlighting the subject’s face and clothing details without harsh shadows.

Thinking process: First, analyze the instructions that clearly state what can be changed. The instruction specifies transforming the person into a 3D Q-style chibi character with stylized proportions (long legs, cute features), which means the overall form, body structure, and scale are allowed to change. The outfit is to be redesigned as a fashion designer OOTD inspired by the current colors (green and burnt orange), so the clothing style, accessories, and design elements may be modified. However, the instruction explicitly states: “Retain the original facial details and pose of the character.” This indicates that facial features such as eye shape, nose, mouth, and expression must remain recognizable. Additionally, the pose—specifically the hand-in-pocket stance—is preserved. The background is to be replaced with a solid color for visual emphasis, so the original beige background is not required to be retained. The editing allows for new accessories like glasses, tablets, or sketchbooks, which are not present in the original image. Therefore, only those elements directly tied to identity and pose are protected from modification.

Allowed Changes List:
- Body proportions (e.g., chibi-style long legs)
- Clothing design and style (replaced with fashion designer OOTD)
- Accessories (addition of glasses, tablet, sketchbook, etc.)
- Background (to be replaced with solid color)
- Hair length and styling (can be adjusted within stylistic interpretation)
- Fabric texture and garment fit (as part of redesign)
- Overall figure scale and silhouette (due to chibi transformation)

Step 2 - Determine the elements that should remain unchanged

Thinking process:
Core recognition elements: The subject's facial features are critical for identity retention. Specifically, the shape of the eyes (almond-shaped), the position and form of the eyebrows, the structure of the nose, the lip shape and smile, and the presence of the gold hoop earrings are all unique identifiers. These features distinguish the individual and ensure continuity between the original and edited versions. Since the instruction mandates retaining "original facial details," these must be preserved. The pose—hand in the front pocket of the trousers—is also specified to be retained, making it a functional/logical element tied to the subject’s posture and spatial relationship with the clothing.

Functional/logical association elements: The hand-in-pocket gesture is not just a detail but a compositional and behavioral cue. It establishes a relaxed, confident stance and maintains consistency in how the subject interacts with her attire. Changing this would alter the intended demeanor and break the logical continuity of the pose. Furthermore, the positioning of the hand relative to the pocket and the visible fingers are important for maintaining the realism and coherence of the action.

Non-modified element deduction: After excluding all allowed changes (body shape, clothing, background, accessories), the remaining unmentioned but visually present elements that are not altered by the instructions must be preserved. These include the specific facial features, the earring type and placement, and the hand position. Even though the clothing will be redesigned, the fact that the hand is in the pocket implies that the pocket itself must exist in the final version, albeit possibly reimagined in the chibi style. However, since the pocket is part of the original garment, its existence and function must be maintained in the new design.

Preservation Targets List:
- Facial features: eye shape, eyebrow form, nose structure, lip shape, and smile
- Gold hoop earrings in both ears
- Hand positioned in the front pocket of the trousers
- Visible fingers inside the pocket
- Overall head orientation and slight forward tilt
- Natural curl pattern of the hair (though style may be simplified)

Q1:  
Thinking process: The almond-shaped eyes are a core facial identifier of the subject. Their distinct shape and placement are essential for recognizing the individual. If they are altered in form (e.g., made rounder or larger), the identity of the person becomes unrecognizable. This feature is central to facial recognition and thus carries the highest weight. The instruction requires retention of "original facial details," which includes eye shape.
Question: Are the eyes almond-shaped and positioned symmetrically on the face?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The gold hoop earrings are distinctive accessories that contribute to the subject’s identity. They are small but clearly visible and located in both earlobes. Their presence and shape are key to maintaining visual consistency. Removing or changing them would alter the subject’s appearance significantly, especially given their prominence in the original image. The instruction does not allow changes to facial details, which includes jewelry worn on the face.
Question: Are there small gold hoop earrings present in both ears?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The hand-in-pocket pose is a functional and compositional element that defines the subject’s stance. The right hand is visibly inserted into the front pocket of the trousers, with fingers slightly curled and visible. This gesture is explicitly required to be retained. Altering it (e.g., removing the hand or placing it elsewhere) would violate the instruction and disrupt the logical continuity of the pose.
Question: Is the right hand placed inside the front pocket of the trousers with fingers visible?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The natural curl pattern of the hair is a defining characteristic of the subject’s hairstyle. While the overall length and volume may be adjusted in the chibi style, the wave-like texture and flow of the curls are part of the original identity. Preserving this ensures the character remains visually consistent with the source. Although the instruction allows some stylization, the fundamental curl structure should not be lost.
Question: Does the hair have a natural, wavy curl pattern falling over the shoulders?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The slight forward tilt of the head is a subtle but important aspect of the subject’s expression and posture. It contributes to the gentle, approachable demeanor captured in the original image. This tilt is part of the "pose" mentioned in the instruction and must be preserved to maintain the intended emotional tone and alignment of facial features.
Question: Is the head slightly tilted forward toward the camera?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The presence of the V-neckline and buttoned front on the blouse is a structural detail that identifies the garment type. While the blouse will be redesigned in the OOTD, the instruction to retain the original pose implies that the general cut and closure method should be reflected in the new design. The buttons and neckline are key to the shirt’s identity and must be preserved in form, even if stylized.
Question: Does the blouse have a V-neckline with visible buttons running down the center?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The green trousers have a high waist and flat front with visible belt loops and a defined waistband seam. These are structural details that define the pants’ style. While the design may be adapted for the chibi character, the basic silhouette and construction elements must be retained to preserve the original clothing identity. The pocket where the hand rests must also be present.
Question: Do the trousers have a high waist with a visible waistband seam and belt loops?
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1
