**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a large African elephant positioned centrally in the frame, facing directly toward the viewer. Its posture is upright and grounded, with its trunk slightly curled downward and resting near the ground. The elephant has large, flared ears, prominent white tusks curving outward, and deeply wrinkled gray skin with visible texture and folds. The eyes are dark and expressive, set within the broad head structure. The background features a vibrant sunset sky transitioning from deep orange to red and purple hues at the top, fading into golden yellow near the horizon. Below, the landscape consists of tall, dry savanna grass in golden-brown tones, dotted with scattered acacia trees—characteristic flat-topped silhouettes typical of African plains. The lighting is warm and directional, casting long shadows and highlighting the contours of the elephant’s body. The overall composition emphasizes natural realism, with strong contrast between the dark silhouette of the elephant and the luminous sky.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction explicitly transforms the **subject (elephant)** into a "majestic cosmic guardian" with significant modifications:  
- Skin replaced with galaxy-patterned texture → **skin texture changed**  
- Tusks become "nebula-like" → **tusk appearance changed**  
- Ears replaced with "celestial sails reflecting starry constellations" → **ear shape and content changed**  
- Trunk emits "cosmic mist" → **trunk function/behavior altered**  
- Planetary rings added around legs → **new elements introduced on limbs**  
- Feet adorned with "luminescent star patterns" → **foot surface modified**

These changes affect **all major components of the elephant**, including form, texture, color, and function. However, the instruction **does not mention altering or removing any part of the background environment**, nor does it specify changing the position, scale, or orientation of the subject relative to the scene. It also does **not require modification of the lighting direction or time of day**, nor does it suggest replacing the acacia trees or grassland terrain.

Therefore, while the **subject's physical identity and appearance are fully transformable**, the **scene context—including spatial layout, environmental elements, and atmospheric conditions—is implicitly preserved** unless otherwise stated.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
- Elephant’s skin texture (to galaxy pattern)  
- Tusk appearance (to nebula-like glow)  
- Ear shape and content (replaced with celestial sails)  
- Trunk behavior (emits swirling cosmic mist)  
- Addition of planetary rings around legs  
- Foot surface (adorned with luminescent stars)  
- Overall color scheme and visual style of the elephant (transformed into cosmic theme)

> Note: No mention of changing background, sky gradient, tree types, grass height, lighting direction, or composition framing.

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
We now apply exclusion logic based on what was **not allowed to change** in the instructions.

### Core Recognition Elements:
Although the elephant is being transformed into a cosmic entity, the **original subject remains an elephant**, and certain **structural forms** must be retained for logical consistency. Even if the skin becomes galactic, the **basic morphology** of the animal—such as the presence of four legs, a trunk, two tusks, and large ears—must still align with the original species. However, since the ears are explicitly replaced with “celestial sails,” this indicates that **form can deviate significantly**. Thus, **core morphological identity is no longer required**—but **spatial positioning and environmental context are critical**.

But the **instructions do not alter the scene**, so:

- The **savanna environment** must remain intact.
- The **acacia trees** must retain their **distinctive flat-topped silhouette** and placement.
- The **golden grassland** must maintain its **height, color, and distribution**.
- The **sunset sky** must preserve its **color gradient** (orange to red to purple), **horizon line**, and **lighting direction**.
- The **relative position of the elephant** (centered, facing forward) must be maintained for compositional coherence.

These are **not mentioned in the edit instructions**, so they fall under **retained elements by default**.

### Functional/Logical Association Elements:
- The **elephant stands in the grass**, which implies interaction with the terrain. If the grass were removed or drastically altered, the grounding of the subject would be lost. Therefore, **the presence and texture of the grass** must be preserved.
- The **sky gradient provides ambient light** that illuminates the scene; altering it would break the lighting logic. Since no new lighting source is specified, the **original sky’s role as primary light source** must be retained.
- The **trees are spatial markers** indicating location and scale. Removing them or changing their form would disrupt environmental authenticity.

### Non-modified Element Deduction:
After excluding all parts of the elephant that are explicitly transformed (ears, skin, tusks, trunk behavior, legs, feet), we are left with:
- The **background landscape**
- The **sky**
- The **grass**
- The **trees**
- The **overall composition and framing**
- The **lighting direction and mood**

Even though the elephant is heavily stylized, **the environment must remain unchanged** because the instruction does **not allow** such alterations. This ensures **visual continuity and contextual fidelity**.

Thus, the **preservation targets** are not about the elephant’s biology anymore, but about **environmental integrity and spatial logic**.

---

**Preservation Targets List:**  
- The presence and distinctive flat-topped shape of the acacia trees in the background  
- The golden-brown color and height of the savanna grass  
- The sunset sky with its gradient from orange to red to purple  
- The horizontal horizon line separating sky and land  
- The central, frontal positioning of the elephant within the frame  
- The warm, directional lighting casting highlights on the elephant and grass

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

Q1:  
Thinking process: The acacia trees are iconic to African savannas and serve as key environmental identifiers. Their flat-topped silhouette is distinct and non-transferable; replacing them with other tree types would fundamentally alter the setting. Since the instruction does not mention modifying them, they must remain. This element is essential for geographical and ecological recognition, making it a core scene feature. Loss would make the scene unrecognizable as African savanna.  
Question: Are the flat-topped acacia trees visible in the background, maintaining their characteristic silhouette and spacing?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The golden-brown savanna grass defines the foreground and midground terrain. Its texture and height contribute to depth and realism. Changing its color or density would break the naturalism of the scene. Since no alteration is instructed, the grass must remain consistent with the original. It is a major environmental component that supports the elephant’s placement and scale.  
Question: Is the tall, golden-brown savanna grass present throughout the foreground and midground, matching the original texture and density?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The sky’s color gradient—from orange near the horizon to deep red and purple above—is a defining atmospheric feature. It establishes the time of day (sunset) and lighting mood. Altering this would change the entire ambiance and lighting logic. As the instruction does not mention modifying the sky, it must remain unchanged. This is a core environmental element affecting all visual cues.  
Question: Does the sky display a continuous gradient from warm orange near the horizon to deep red and purple at the top?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The horizon line separates sky from land and anchors the composition. Its straightness and position determine the spatial relationship between the elephant and the environment. Moving or distorting it would disrupt perspective and balance. Since the instruction does not alter the scene layout, this structural element must be preserved.  
Question: Is the horizon line clearly visible and straight, dividing the sky from the savanna landscape at approximately one-third up the image?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The warm lighting direction, casting soft highlights on the elephant’s back and sides and creating long shadows, is critical for depth and realism. This lighting originates from the low sun in the sky. Any change in light angle or intensity would contradict the sunset setting. Since no new lighting is specified, the original illumination must be retained.  
Question: Is the lighting consistent with a low-angle sunset, producing warm highlights on the upper surfaces of the elephant and grass, and casting long shadows behind the subject?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The elephant’s central, frontal position within the frame is a compositional choice that draws focus. Shifting it off-center or rotating it would change the narrative impact. While the elephant’s form is transformed, its **placement in space** is not mentioned as altered, so it must remain centered. This maintains visual balance and alignment with the original framing.  
Question: Is the elephant positioned centrally in the frame, facing directly toward the viewer with its body aligned vertically?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The absence of additional elements such as rivers, rocks, or animals in the background suggests a minimalist savanna scene. Adding such elements without instruction would introduce inconsistency. The original simplicity must be preserved to maintain coherence. Though minor, these absences define the scene’s character.  
Question: Are there no visible water bodies, rocky outcrops, or other animals in the background beyond the acacia trees and grass?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q8:  
Thinking process: The texture of the grass blades, especially in the foreground, contributes to realism. While not a core identifier, it enhances visual fidelity. Blurring or smoothing it would reduce detail and coherence. Since no textural modification is requested, it should remain consistent.  
Question: Do the grass blades in the foreground show individual strands with slight variation in length and direction, contributing to a natural texture?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1
