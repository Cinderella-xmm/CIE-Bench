Description of reference image: The subject is a muscular Māori warrior standing in a wide, dynamic haka stance on a moss-covered rock within a lush green valley. He faces forward with arms outstretched and fingers splayed, mouth open in a fierce expression with his tongue protruding. His face is adorned with intricate black moko kauae (facial tattoos) featuring bold spirals, angular lines, and symmetrical patterns extending from the forehead down to the jawline, including detailed markings around the eyes and nose. He has a thick, dark beard and short black hair styled upward. His torso is bare, covered in elaborate traditional moko designs—swirling spirals, curved bands, and geometric motifs—extending across the chest, shoulders, and arms. He wears a woven flax piupiu skirt made of layered, light brown dried grasses, secured by a wide red-brown belt with a central rectangular metallic buckle displaying interlocking patterns. Around each lower leg are thick, shaggy flax leggings that reach mid-calf. The background consists of steep, forested mountain slopes forming a deep valley, with soft mist rising between them and sunlight filtering through the upper atmosphere. The foreground includes native New Zealand flora such as tall harakeke (flax) plants. The overall lighting is natural daylight, casting subtle shadows and highlighting textures.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions word by word to determine what can be changed. The instruction specifies designing a digital character card styled like an RPG collectible, which implies a complete transformation of presentation format—adding stat bars, banners, nameplates, and framing elements. However, it explicitly states to "keep" certain elements: the bold moko patterns, flax piupiu skirt, and wide haka stance. These are not allowed to change. It also requires retaining rich earthy tones and the layered green-valley backdrop, meaning the environment must remain visually consistent in color and composition. The instruction allows for stylized 3D art, so rendering style may shift, but core visual content must persist. The addition of stat bars, title banner, nameplate, and metallic frame are new elements introduced during editing, not present in the original. Therefore, only those aspects directly mentioned as unchanged or implied by retention requirements are preserved.

Allowed Changes List:
- Presentation format (e.g., conversion into an RPG-style card)
- Frame design (polished metallic edges)
- Addition of text elements (title banner, nameplate, stat bars)
- Rendering style (stylized 3D art)
- Color tone adjustments (within "rich earthy tones" scope)
- Lighting effects (as long as consistent with natural daylight feel)

Thinking process:
Core recognition elements are determined based on iconic cultural markers and identity-defining features. The moko kauae facial tattoo pattern is a culturally specific identifier of Māori warriors and is essential for recognizing the subject's identity and cultural context. Altering its shape, symmetry, or placement would misrepresent the character’s heritage and role. Similarly, the flax piupiu skirt and leg wraps are distinctive traditional garments; their material texture and layered structure are critical to authenticity. The wide haka stance is a functional performance posture tied to ritual significance—its form must be preserved to maintain narrative coherence. Functional/logical association elements include the positioning of the warrior in front of the valley, which grounds him in a sacred landscape context; changing this layout could disrupt symbolic meaning. Non-modified element deduction involves excluding all items listed as changeable (like frame or stats), leaving only the original subject’s physical traits and environmental setting that were not authorized for modification. Visual coherence demands that even minor details like the texture of the flax or the exact spiral patterns on the chest remain intact to prevent dissonance.

Preservation Targets List:
- The presence and pattern of moko kauae facial tattoos
- The full-body moko designs on chest, shoulders, and arms
- The flax piupiu skirt with layered texture and red-brown belt
- The flax leg wraps on both lower legs
- The wide haka stance with bent knees, splayed arms, and extended fingers
- The green valley backdrop with steep slopes and mist
- The natural daylight lighting and shadow direction
- The position of the warrior standing on a mossy rock in the foreground
- The presence of native flax plants in the immediate foreground

Q1:  
Thinking process: The moko kauae facial tattoos are the most culturally significant and visually distinct feature of the warrior, serving as a core identity marker. Their specific spiral and angular patterns, particularly around the eyes, nose, and jaw, are unique to Māori tradition and define the character’s status and lineage. Any alteration to these patterns—such as simplification, removal, or repositioning—would fundamentally change the character’s identity and render him unrecognizable as a traditional Kaitiaki figure. This element is therefore critical for cultural and visual identification, warranting the highest weight.

Question: Is the facial moko kauae tattoo pattern with symmetrical spirals and angular lines clearly visible and intact, covering the forehead, cheeks, and chin?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The full-body moko designs on the chest, shoulders, and arms are integral to the warrior’s appearance and represent spiritual and ancestral connections. These swirling patterns are not merely decorative but carry symbolic meaning. Removing or distorting them would compromise the authenticity of the character. Since the instruction explicitly requires keeping “bold moko patterns,” their preservation is mandatory. The exact shapes, density, and flow of the spirals must remain consistent with the original.

Question: Are the intricate moko patterns on the chest, shoulders, and upper arms present with continuous swirling and curved motifs matching the original design?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The flax piupiu skirt is a key cultural garment associated with Māori ceremonial dress. Its layered, textured construction from dried flax blades is visually distinctive and functionally tied to the haka performance. Changing its material, layering, or color would break cultural accuracy. The instruction specifies retaining the skirt, so its structural integrity and texture must be preserved.

Question: Is the flax piupiu skirt composed of layered, light brown dried flax strands hanging in tiers, secured by a red-brown woven belt with a central metallic buckle?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The flax leg wraps are secondary but still important accessories that complete the traditional attire. They are made of similar fibrous material and serve both aesthetic and functional roles during movement. Their presence contributes to the authenticity of the warrior’s costume. While less prominent than the skirt or tattoos, they are part of the required traditional ensemble and must be retained.

Question: Are thick, shaggy flax leg wraps present on both lower legs, reaching approximately mid-calf and matching the texture of the piupiu skirt?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The wide haka stance is not just a pose but a ritualized expression of strength and challenge. The bent knees, splayed arms, and extended fingers are essential components of this action. Altering the posture—such as straightening the legs or raising hands differently—would destroy the intended dramatic effect and cultural significance. The instruction explicitly mentions preserving this stance, making it a functional and visual necessity.

Question: Is the warrior positioned in a wide haka stance with knees bent, arms extended outward at shoulder height, and fingers splayed?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The green valley backdrop provides environmental context and reinforces the connection between the warrior and nature, aligning with the "Kaitiaki of the Valleys" theme. The steep, forested slopes, mist, and natural lighting establish a sense of place. While the instruction allows stylization, it requires retaining the layered green-valley backdrop. Thus, the overall topography, vegetation density, and atmospheric depth must remain recognizable.

Question: Is the background composed of steep, densely vegetated mountain slopes forming a deep valley with visible mist rising between them?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The moss-covered rock in the foreground anchors the warrior spatially and adds realism to the scene. It is a specific environmental detail that supports the naturalistic setting. While not a core identity feature, its presence helps maintain visual consistency and grounding. Removing it would disrupt the compositional balance and suggest a different location.

Question: Is the warrior standing on a large, moss-covered rock in the foreground with visible texture and shadow beneath his feet?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q8:  
Thinking process: The native flax plants in the foreground are characteristic of New Zealand ecosystems and contribute to the authenticity of the setting. Their sharp, upright leaves add depth and regional specificity. Although minor compared to the warrior or mountains, they are part of the original scene and help reinforce the cultural and geographical context.

Question: Are tall, green harakeke (flax) plants visible in the immediate foreground surrounding the rock?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1
