Description of reference image: The subject is a humanoid mobile suit robot, primarily in shades of gray and white with orange accent markings, positioned dynamically mid-leap against a black background. It holds a long rifle in its right hand raised upward and a large sword in its left hand angled downward. The robot features angular armor plating, twin wing-like structures on its back with orange-tipped edges, a pointed head with red eye lenses, and a cockpit area with visible internal details. Its legs are bent in motion, with each foot equipped with three orange thruster nozzles. The overall design is sleek and mechanical, emphasizing sharp lines and asymmetrical components. The pose suggests forward momentum and combat readiness. The image includes text disclaimers at the top stating it is CG based on development data and an image, and a copyright notice “©SOTSU·SUNRISE” at the bottom-left corner.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions to determine what can be changed. The instruction specifies transforming the robot into a "premium collectible figure," which implies changes to material finish (brushed metal and matte), packaging (hexagonal box labeled "MECHA VANGUARD"), inclusion of replaceable weapons, detailed engravings, articulated joints, and a dramatic splash screen of a futuristic cityscape. These modifications target the presentation, materials, accessories, and display context—elements external to the core identity of the robot itself. However, the instruction does not mention altering the robot’s fundamental form, proportions, color scheme, or key structural features such as the weapon types, limb configuration, or distinctive markings. Therefore, only elements explicitly tied to presentation or environment (e.g., packaging, background) are allowed to change. The robot's physical identity, including its shape, color accents, and armament, must remain consistent unless stated otherwise.

Allowed Changes List:
- Material finish (e.g., brushed metal, matte texture)
- Packaging (sleek hexagonal box labeled "MECHA VANGUARD")
- Replaceable weapons (implying potential swapping of parts)
- Detailed armor engravings (surface-level additions)
- Articulated joints (mechanical articulation, possibly affecting poseability but not structure)
- Background scene (futuristic cityscape splash screen)

Step 2 – Determine the elements that should remain unchanged

Thinking process:
Core recognition elements: The robot is a specific mecha from the Gundam franchise, identifiable by its unique silhouette, color scheme (gray/white with orange highlights), head shape with red eyes, wing structure, and weapon configuration. These features are essential for public recognition and brand identity. Changing the color palette or removing key components like the orange thrusters or wing tips would compromise identification. For example, the red eye lenses are iconic visual markers; their removal would make the unit unrecognizable as this particular model.

Functional/logical association elements: The robot’s weapons (rifle and sword) are held in specific positions that suggest functional use—this dynamic pose is integral to its portrayal as a combat-ready unit. Altering the grip or orientation could disrupt the logical action implied. Additionally, the thruster nozzles on the feet are part of the propulsion system logic, and their presence supports the design rationale of flight or hovering capability. If removed, the mechanical consistency is broken.

Non modified element deduction: After excluding allowed changes (material, packaging, background), all remaining visual aspects of the robot—including its body shape, joint structure, armor segmentation, and color distribution—must be preserved. Even minor details like the placement of red markings on the chest or the angular cut of the shoulder armor contribute to visual coherence and authenticity. These elements are not mentioned in the instructions as modifiable, so they must be retained.

Preservation Targets List:
- The overall shape and silhouette of the robot
- The gray and white coloration with orange accents
- The red eye lenses in the head
- The dual weapons: rifle in right hand, sword in left hand
- The wing-like structures on the back with orange tips
- The three orange thruster nozzles on each foot
- The angular armor plating and mechanical joint design
- The position and orientation of limbs in the dynamic pose
- The visible cockpit section with internal detail
- The copyright notice "©SOTSU·SUNRISE" at the bottom-left corner

    Q1:
    Thinking process: The red eye lenses are a core identification feature of this mecha model. In the Gundam series, eye color and shape are critical for distinguishing units, especially when combined with the angular head design. Removing or changing the red lenses would fundamentally alter the robot’s identity and prevent recognition. This is a 3-point element because it is a signature visual trait directly tied to the character’s identity.
    Question: Are the red eye lenses present in the head of the robot?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes

{
    Q2:
    Thinking process: The orange thruster nozzles on the feet are functionally significant and visually distinct. They are located symmetrically on both feet and serve as propulsion indicators. Their presence is essential to maintaining the design logic and aesthetic balance. Losing them would break the symmetry and reduce the mechanical credibility of the design. This is a 3-point element due to its role in both function and visual identity.
    Question: Are there three orange circular thruster nozzles on each foot of the robot?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q3:
    Thinking process: The large sword held in the left hand is a primary weapon and a defining feature of this unit’s combat configuration. Its size and positioning relative to the body are key to understanding the robot’s role as a close-combat variant. Replacing or omitting it would change the intended usage narrative. This is a 3-point element because it is central to the robot’s functional identity.
    Question: Is a long, straight sword being held in the robot’s left hand?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q4:
    Thinking process: The wing-like structures on the back with orange-tipped edges are distinctive aerodynamic features that contribute to the robot’s silhouette. They are not just decorative but are part of the unit’s profile recognition. Changing their shape or removing the orange tips would affect visual coherence and brand consistency. This is a 2-point element because it is important for silhouette recognition but less critical than the face or weapons.
    Question: Are there two wing-like structures on the back of the robot, each with an orange tip?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q5:
    Thinking process: The rifle held in the right hand is another core weapon component. Its design, including the barrel length and magazine shape, is consistent with the robot’s arsenal. Removing or replacing it would alter the combat profile. While it may be replaced in the collectible version, the original image must retain it for consistency. This is a 2-point element because it is a major accessory tied to the unit’s function.
    Question: Is a long rifle being held in the robot’s right hand?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q6:
    Thinking process: The gray and white color scheme with orange accents is a defining characteristic of this mecha model. The color distribution across the body, particularly the orange markings on the shoulders and wings, is essential for identification. Any deviation would make it unrecognizable as this specific unit. This is a 3-point element because color is a primary identifier in mecha design.
    Question: Is the robot primarily colored in gray and white with orange accent markings?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q7:
    Thinking process: The dynamic pose with bent legs and raised arms indicates movement and action. The specific angle of the limbs contributes to the sense of motion and combat readiness. Altering this pose would affect the narrative context. While articulation might allow variation in the collectible, the original pose must be preserved. This is a 2-point element because it affects the emotional and functional expression of the robot.
    Question: Is the robot posed with one leg bent forward and the other extended backward, suggesting forward motion?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

    Q8:
    Thinking process: The copyright notice "©SOTSU·SUNRISE" is a legal and branding element present in the original image. It identifies the intellectual property owner and must be retained in any faithful representation. Its absence would indicate unauthorized modification. This is a 1-point element because it is a textual detail, but it is necessary for authenticity.
    Question: Is the text "©SOTSU·SUNRISE" visible in the bottom-left corner of the image?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
