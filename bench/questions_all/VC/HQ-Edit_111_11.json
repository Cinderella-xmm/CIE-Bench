      "thinking_process": "The elderly man’s deeply wrinkled face with pronounced lines around the eyes and mouth is a core identification feature distinguishing him as the original subject. This level of aging detail is unique to the character and essential for identity retention. Loss of these specific facial textures would make the figure unrecognizable as the same individual, regardless of costume changes. Therefore, this is a key element with weight 3.",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the elderly man’s deeply wrinkled facial features, including the pronounced vertical lines on the forehead and crow’s feet around the eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The saxophone is not just a prop but a functional object directly involved in the action. Its metallic appearance, curved shape, and the way it is held by both hands with fingers positioned on keys are critical to the musical performance depicted. Even if upgraded to a vintage model, its basic form and interaction with the hands must remain intact. Changing its shape or removing it would invalidate the core activity. Thus, this is a high-weight functional element.",
      "question": "Is the saxophone still present and held in the same manner, with the player’s left hand on the keys and the mouthpiece touching the lips?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The table setup — two glasses and one bottle — forms a logical environment for the scene. Their placement relative to the subject supports the narrative of drinking during music. Although the contents might change (e.g., beer vs. whiskey), their presence and spatial arrangement are crucial for maintaining scene coherence. Removing or relocating them would disrupt the original composition.",
      "question": "Are the two glasses and the brown bottle still placed on the table in front of the musician, with one glass partially full and the other empty?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The dark wooden table surface with visible reflection of light and objects is a key environmental detail that grounds the scene. It provides texture and depth, contributing to the realism of the setting. Even if the background changes, the table’s material and reflective properties should remain consistent unless stated otherwise. This detail helps maintain visual continuity.",
      "question": "Is the dark wooden tabletop still visible with subtle reflections of the glasses and bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The lighting direction — coming from above and slightly behind — creates distinct shadows on the left side of the face and highlights on the right. This directional lighting is essential for preserving the dramatic mood and three-dimensionality of the subject. While the color temperature may shift to match the 1920s aesthetic, the source and angle should remain consistent to maintain the original compositional balance.",
      "question": "Is the primary light source still positioned above and behind the subject, casting shadows on the left side of his face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The position of the hands — particularly the left hand gripping the saxophone body and the right hand covering the keys — is essential for conveying the act of playing. Any significant deviation would misrepresent the musical gesture. Though the sleeves may change due to new clothing, the hand placement and finger articulation must remain accurate.",
      "question": "Are the musician’s hands positioned correctly on the saxophone, with the left hand supporting the lower section and the right hand pressing the keys?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
