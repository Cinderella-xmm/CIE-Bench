      "thinking_process": "The classical archway is the dominant structural element framing the entire scene. Its presence defines the composition and creates a sense of viewing through a portal. If removed or significantly altered, the image loses its defining architectural context. This is a core identity feature of the scene, making it a 3-point question.",
      "question": "Is the classical archway with ornate carvings present and maintaining its original shape and position in the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The Corinthian column capital, with its characteristic acanthus leaf design, is a distinctive architectural feature. Its retention ensures continuity in the style and structural logic of the scene. Even if the column base changes, the capital must remain to preserve the classical motif. This is a key architectural identifier, warranting a 3-point weight.",
      "question": "Is the Corinthian column capital with acanthus leaf detailing visible and correctly positioned beneath the spherical perch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The stone sphere serving as the perch is a unique sculptural element. Although the instruction replaces it with a shelf, the function and location of the perch must remain consistent. The original sphere’s position atop the capital is crucial for spatial logic. Thus, even if transformed, its **placement** must be preserved. This is a functional element tied to the subject’s position, so it is a 2-point question.",
      "question": "Is the perch located directly on top of the Corinthian column capital, maintaining its original vertical alignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The background skyline, including the tall column on the left and the mix of Gothic and modern buildings, establishes the setting. Although the buildings may be rendered as cookies, their **silhouettes and spatial arrangement** must remain to preserve the scene’s depth and composition. This is a key environmental element, affecting overall coherence, hence a 2-point weight.",
      "question": "Are the tall fluted column on the left and the distant spired buildings visible in their original positions and silhouettes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The sky with its bright blue color and scattered cumulus clouds provides the backdrop and lighting context. Since no instruction mentions altering the sky, it must remain unchanged to preserve atmosphere and lighting consistency. This is a minor but important environmental detail, contributing to visual harmony, so it is a 1-point question.",
      "question": "Is the sky depicted as bright blue with scattered white cumulus clouds, matching the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The ornamental carvings on the arch and column frame are intricate and stylistically significant. They define the classical aesthetic and are not mentioned for modification. Their retention ensures visual fidelity to the original design. Though secondary, they are essential for authenticity, so assigned 2 points.",
      "question": "Are the floral and scroll carvings on the arch and column frame present and accurately rendered?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "thinking_process": "The pigeon’s side-facing posture with head turned slightly toward the viewer is a key compositional choice. Even as a plush toy, the **orientation and gaze direction** must remain to preserve the subject’s engagement with the viewer. This is a core behavioral feature of the original image, making it a 2-point question.",
      "question": "Is the pigeon oriented sideways with its head turned slightly toward the viewer, maintaining its original posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
