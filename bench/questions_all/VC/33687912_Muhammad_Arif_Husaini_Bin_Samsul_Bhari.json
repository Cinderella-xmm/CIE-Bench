      "thinking_process": "The sun’s position and shape are core to identifying the scene as a sunset. It is the central focal point and source of illumination. If it is moved, resized, or altered in shape (e.g., elongated or fragmented), the scene loses its defining moment — the golden hour. The sun must remain a bright, circular disc at the horizon, centered between the two landmasses, to maintain the original image’s identity and emotional tone. This is a 3-point element because its absence or alteration would make the image unrecognizable as a sunset scene.",
      "question": "Is the sun positioned low on the horizon, centered between the two silhouetted landmasses, and appearing as a bright, circular disc?",

      "thinking_process": "The two landmasses on either side create a natural frame and guide the viewer’s gaze to the sun. Their silhouetted forms and relative positions are essential for the composition. If they are removed, reshaped, or repositioned, the scene’s balance and depth are lost. These are 3-point elements because they define the spatial structure of the image and are critical for recognizing the setting.",
      "question": "Are there two distinct silhouetted landmasses, one on the left and one on the right, framing the horizon and the sun?",

      "thinking_process": "The water’s reflection of the sky’s gradient is a key visual feature that ties the foreground and background together. The shimmering orange-red patterns on the water surface are not just decorative but integral to the scene’s atmosphere. Losing this reflection would break the visual continuity and reduce the image’s emotional impact. This is a 2-point element because it is important for environmental consistency and mood.",
      "question": "Does the water surface reflect the orange-red gradient of the sky, creating shimmering patterns that mirror the sunset?",

      "thinking_process": "The sky’s color gradient from warm orange near the horizon to deeper red and maroon at the top is a defining characteristic of the sunset. This gradient provides the emotional tone and visual richness. Altering the color distribution or intensity would change the scene’s mood and authenticity. This is a 2-point element because it establishes the time of day and atmospheric conditions.",
      "question": "Is the sky filled with a gradient of warm orange near the horizon transitioning to deeper red and maroon tones higher up?",

      "thinking_process": "The horizontal horizon line separates the sky and water and is essential for establishing perspective and balance. Its straightness and position are critical for the composition. If it is tilted or broken, the scene appears unstable. This is a 2-point element because it supports the overall spatial logic of the image.",
      "question": "Is there a clear, straight horizon line dividing the sky and water, with the sun resting directly on it?",

      "thinking_process": "The presence of thin, wispy clouds in the upper sky adds texture and depth to the sky without disrupting the gradient. While minor, they contribute to the realism of the scene. Removing them would make the sky too uniform and less dynamic. This is a 1-point element because it enhances detail but is not essential for core identification.",
      "question": "Are there faint, thin clouds visible in the upper portion of the sky, partially illuminated by the sunset?",

      "thinking_process": "The water surface has a subtle ripple texture, indicating calm but not still water. This texture interacts with the light and reflection, contributing to the realism of the scene. Smoothing it out or making it glass-like would remove natural detail. This is a 1-point element because it affects texture fidelity but not core identity.",
      "question": "Does the water surface show gentle ripples and small waves, indicating calm movement?",
