Description of reference image: The subject is a modern high-back office chair positioned centrally in a minimalist studio setting. The chair features a sleek black leather upholstery with horizontal ribbed detailing on the backrest and a separate, cushioned headrest at the top. The armrests are made of polished chrome metal with a curved, ergonomic design that connects seamlessly to the frame. The seat is padded and slightly contoured for comfort, supported by a five-star chrome base with dual-wheel casters. The chair is angled slightly to the right, allowing a clear view of its side profile and structural symmetry. The background is a neutral gradient from dark gray on the left to light gray on the right, creating a soft spotlight effect on the chair. The floor is smooth and reflective, subtly mirroring the chair's base. The overall lighting is directional, emphasizing the chair’s form and material textures.

Thinking process:  
First, analyze the editing instructions word by word:  
- "Transform the office chair into a LEGO model" → This indicates a complete transformation of the **form** and **material** of the chair; therefore, the **physical structure** and **material appearance** (e.g., leather, metal) can be changed.  
- "Using sleek black for cushions, silver for armrests and base, and translucent gray for wheels" → Specifies new **colors** and **materials**, implying original colors and textures are no longer required.  
- "Assemble seat and backrest from layered bricks with smooth gradients" → Indicates the **construction method** changes to LEGO-style brick assembly, so the **internal structure** and **surface texture** of the seat and backrest can change.  
- "Keep the armrest design as simple hinged parts" → This implies the **basic shape and function** of the armrests should remain similar, but they may be simplified in form.  
- "Position the LEGO chair on a plain white tabletop to highlight its geometric construction" → The **scene/environment** must be changed: the original studio background and floor are replaced with a white tabletop.  

Thus, allowed changes include:  
- Chair material (leather → LEGO bricks)  
- Chair surface texture (smooth leather → layered bricks)  
- Chair color (black leather, chrome → specified LEGO colors)  
- Structural composition (solid components → modular brick layers)  
- Scene background (gradient studio → plain white tabletop)  
- Lighting (directional spotlight → likely neutral overhead)  

However, the instruction does **not** mention changing the **overall silhouette**, **proportions**, or **functional layout** of the chair. It retains the **chair’s identity as an office chair**, even if constructed from LEGO. Also, it specifies retaining the **armrest design** as “simple hinged parts,” which implies their **positioning and basic functional shape** must be preserved.  

Allowed Changes List:  
- Material of chair (leather, metal → LEGO bricks)  
- Texture of cushions and backrest (smooth leather → layered brick surface)  
- Color scheme (original black/chrome → black/silver/translucent gray)  
- Construction method (monolithic → modular brick assembly)  
- Background environment (studio gradient → plain white tabletop)  
- Floor surface (reflective gray → flat white tabletop)  
- Lighting setup (directional → neutral)  

Step 2 – Determine the elements that should remain unchanged  

Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements:  
The chair is a recognizable **office chair** with specific **ergonomic design features**. Its **identity** relies on certain **structural and functional elements**:  
- The **five-star base** with casters is a standard feature of rolling office chairs. Even if made of LEGO, this **base configuration** must be retained to preserve the chair’s identity as a swivel office chair.  
- The **headrest** is a distinct component located above the main backrest, serving a functional purpose. Its **presence and position** must be preserved, even if reconstructed in LEGO form.  
- The **armrests** are described as “simple hinged parts” — meaning their **attachment points**, **position relative to the seat**, and **general curvature** must be preserved for functional coherence.  

Functional/logical association elements:  
- The **casters** are essential for mobility. Their **placement under each leg** of the five-star base must be preserved to maintain functionality.  
- The **relationship between seat and backrest** — where the backrest rises vertically behind the seat — must remain consistent to preserve the chair’s ergonomics and visual logic.  

Non-modified element deduction:  
After excluding all allowed changes (material, texture, color, scene), the following **structural relationships and forms** must remain:  
- The **five-point star base** with one caster per leg  
- The **headrest positioned directly above the backrest**  
- The **armrests extending laterally from the sides of the seat and backrest junction**  
- The **overall height and proportions** of the chair (high-back, tall headrest)  
- The **curved contour of the seat** and **vertical alignment of the backrest**  

Preservation Targets List:  
- The five-star base with five legs and one caster per leg  
- The presence of a separate headrest above the main backrest  
- The lateral positioning of armrests on both sides of the chair  
- The vertical alignment of the backrest relative to the seat  
- The general silhouette of a high-back office chair with a tall back and headrest

    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The five-star base with five legs and one caster per leg is a core functional and iconic feature of rolling office chairs. It defines the chair’s mobility and stability. Even when transformed into LEGO, this structure must retain its five-point geometry and caster placement to maintain the chair’s identity. Loss of this would result in a non-functional or unrecognizable office chair, making it a critical identification element. Therefore, it receives a weight of 3 points.
    Question: Is the chair supported by a five-star base with exactly five legs, each ending in a caster?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The headrest is a defining feature of this particular office chair model, positioned distinctly above the main backrest. It serves both ergonomic and aesthetic purposes. Even if rebuilt in LEGO, its presence and elevated position must be preserved to maintain the chair’s identity. Removing or relocating it would fundamentally alter the chair’s design and make it unrecognizable. Thus, it is a key recognition element with a weight of 3 points.
    Question: Is there a separate headrest cushion positioned directly above the main backrest?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}
{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The armrests are attached to the sides of the chair and extend outward, forming part of the ergonomic support system. The instruction specifies they should remain as “simple hinged parts,” indicating their lateral placement and connection point must be preserved. Their absence or relocation would disrupt the chair’s functional symmetry and visual balance. This is a key structural element affecting both form and function, thus assigned a weight of 2 points.
    Question: Are there two armrests, one on each side, extending horizontally from the chair’s midsection?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The vertical alignment of the backrest relative to the seat is essential for maintaining the chair’s ergonomic profile and visual proportion. This alignment ensures the backrest supports the user’s spine properly. Even in LEGO form, this spatial relationship must be preserved. Disrupting it would compromise the chair’s intended use and appearance. This is an important structural relationship, hence a weight of 2 points.
    Question: Is the backrest vertically aligned behind the seat, rising from the same central axis?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}
{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The overall silhouette of the chair — including the tall backrest and headrest — is a distinctive visual identifier. While materials and textures may change, the general outline must remain consistent to preserve recognition. This includes the height ratio between seat and backrest. Altering this silhouette would make the chair unrecognizable as the original model. This is a secondary but important visual cue, thus assigned a weight of 1 point.
    Question: Does the chair maintain a tall, high-back silhouette with the headrest significantly higher than the seat?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
