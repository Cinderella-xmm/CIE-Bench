**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a two-story log cabin situated in a forested area under a clear blue sky. The structure features a prominent A-frame roof with exposed wooden beams and triangular glass windows at the peak, forming a symmetrical gable design. The upper level includes a wraparound wooden deck supported by thick vertical log posts, with railings made of horizontal wooden slats. The lower level has a garage door on the right side, a smaller access door to its left, and a rectangular window to the far left. The exterior walls are constructed from horizontally aligned light brown wooden planks. The foundation is elevated above ground level, supported by large wooden columns. Beneath the deck, there is a paved driveway leading to the garage. The surrounding environment consists of tall pine trees, some with thin trunks and full green canopies, standing densely around the cabin. The ground is covered in dry grass, dirt, and scattered rocks, particularly along the base of the structure on the right side where a stone retaining wall is visible. The lighting is bright daylight, casting sharp shadows beneath the deck and highlighting the natural wood grain and textures.

**Thinking process:**  
First, analyze the editing instructions word by word:  
- "Convert the log cabin into a giant geometric crystal structure" → This explicitly changes the **form and material** of the entire subject. Therefore, the **original wooden structure** is no longer required; it may be fully replaced.  
- "Use transparent faceted surfaces for the exterior, casting various hues of blue and green" → Indicates replacement of **exterior texture and color**, so original wood finish and color are not retained.  
- "Transform the wooden beams into meticulously cut multifaceted edges" → Implies that **structural elements (beams)** are being reimagined in form, but their **spatial role** (supporting structure) may remain logically intact.  
- "Set the crystal cabin on a flat white marble platform" → Changes the **foundation and ground surface**. The original earthy ground and stone base are to be replaced.  
- "Include small crystal formations as decorative accents along the base" → Adds new **decorative elements**, not present in the original.

From this, we determine:
- The **subject’s form** (log cabin) is to be transformed.
- The **material** (wood) is to be replaced with crystal.
- The **color palette** (natural brown tones) is to be replaced with blue/green hues.
- The **ground/foundation** is to be changed from dirt/rock to marble.
- The **surrounding trees and sky** are not mentioned, so they may be preserved or altered depending on artistic intent — but since no instruction says to keep them, they are **not required to be retained** unless logically tied to identity.

However, the **spatial layout and architectural logic** must be preserved if the transformation is to remain coherent. For example:
- The **deck’s position** (upper level), **garage placement**, **window positions**, and **overall footprint** may need to align with original functional layout even if materials change.

But note: The instruction does **not** require retention of any specific visual feature of the original cabin beyond its **structure as a reference point for transformation**.

Therefore, only elements **explicitly required** or **functionally essential** should be retained.

---

**Allowed Changes List:**  
- The **entire exterior material** (wood) → changed to transparent crystal  
- The **color scheme** (natural brown wood) → changed to blue and green hues  
- The **roof shape** (A-frame) → may be preserved in silhouette but reinterpreted as faceted crystal  
- The **beam structure** → transformed into multifaceted edges  
- The **foundation and ground** → changed from natural terrain to white marble platform  
- The **base decoration** → added crystal formations  
- The **trees and sky** → not specified, so may be altered or removed  
- The **deck railing and support posts** → reimagined as crystal facets  
- The **windows** → may be replaced with transparent crystal surfaces  
- The **garage and doors** → likely preserved in function but restructured as crystal forms  

> **Note**: No instruction requires preservation of specific details like window size, beam thickness, or tree species — thus, all such features are allowed to change unless they are core to identity.

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
We now apply exclusion based on the “Allowed Changes List” and assess what must remain unchanged due to:

1. **Core recognition elements**: These are essential to identifying the subject *as a cabin* or *as a structure with specific architectural features*. However, since the instruction explicitly transforms the cabin into a crystal structure, **the original material and appearance are not required**. But **functional layout and spatial relationships** must be preserved for coherence — otherwise, the transformation loses meaning.

   - Example: If the garage is moved from the right side to the back, it breaks logical consistency. So **position of functional elements** (like garage, main entrance, deck) must be retained **in terms of location and purpose**, even if form changes.

2. **Functional/logical association elements**:  
   - The **deck must remain on the upper level** and **supported by columns** — this is functional. Even if columns become crystal facets, their **vertical support role and relative position** must be preserved.
   - The **garage door must remain accessible from the front**, and **must be on the lower level** — changing its location would break structural logic.
   - The **window placements** (especially the three triangular ones at the peak) are iconic and define the cabin’s silhouette. While they may become crystal facets, their **triangular shape and position** must be retained to preserve architectural identity.

3. **Non-modified element deduction**:  
   After excluding all allowed changes (materials, colors, textures, ground), the following **remain unmentioned and thus must be retained**:
   - **Overall building footprint** (shape and proportions)
   - **Relative positions of key components** (e.g., garage on right, deck on top, windows at apex)
   - **Architectural symmetry** (the cabin is symmetric about its center axis)
   - **Presence of the triangular gable windows** (they are distinctive)

Even though the material changes, the **core architectural form** — especially the **A-frame roof with central triangular windows**, **two-level design**, and **front-facing garage** — defines the cabin’s identity. Without these, the edited image would not be recognizable as a transformation of *this specific cabin*.

Thus, **the spatial layout and key structural features** must be preserved, even if rendered in crystal.

---

**Preservation Targets List:**  
- The **presence and triangular shape of the three upper windows** at the peak of the A-frame roof  
- The **two-level structure** (upper deck, lower garage level)  
- The **position of the garage door on the right side of the lower level**  
- The **central alignment of the main entrance (door) between the garage and window**  
- The **symmetry of the cabin about its central vertical axis**  
- The **location and function of the deck** (upper level, supported by columns, wrapping around the front)  
- The **relative height and proportion of the roof to the body of the cabin**  

These are not materials or colors — they are **architectural logic and spatial relationships** that define the subject’s identity, even after transformation.

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The three triangular windows at the peak of the A-frame roof are a defining architectural feature of this cabin. Their presence and arrangement form a distinctive visual signature that identifies the structure. Removing or altering their shape would fundamentally change the identity of the building. Even if transformed into crystal facets, their triangular geometry and central positioning must be preserved to maintain recognition. This is a core identity element, hence weighted 3 points.
    Question: Are the three triangular windows positioned at the apex of the A-frame roof clearly present and maintaining their triangular shape?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The two-level structure — with a deck on the upper level and a garage on the lower level — is critical to the functional layout of the cabin. Changing the deck to a different level or removing the garage would violate the architectural logic of the original. Even in crystal form, the upper deck must exist and be supported by columns, and the lower level must house the garage. This spatial hierarchy is essential for coherence, making it a high-priority retention target.
    Question: Is the cabin structured with a raised deck on the upper level and a garage on the lower level, maintaining the same vertical separation?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The garage door is located on the right side of the lower level and is a key functional component. Its position is consistent with the original image and must be preserved to maintain spatial logic. Moving it to another side or replacing it with a non-functional opening would disrupt the intended layout. Although the material may change, its location and purpose must remain unchanged.
    Question: Is the garage door located on the right side of the lower level, adjacent to the main entrance?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The central vertical axis of the cabin is symmetric, with the main entrance and roof peak aligned. This symmetry is a core design feature. Any asymmetry introduced during transformation would distort the original identity. Preserving this alignment ensures the structure remains recognizable as the same cabin, even in crystal form.
    Question: Is the cabin symmetric about its central vertical axis, with the roof peak, main entrance, and supporting columns aligned centrally?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The deck is supported by vertical columns that extend from the ground to the upper level. These columns are essential for structural integrity and are visually distinct in the original image. Even if transformed into crystal facets, their number, spacing, and vertical orientation must be preserved to maintain the architectural framework. Losing them would collapse the support system and make the transformation illogical.
    Question: Are the vertical support columns beneath the deck present and positioned at regular intervals along the front facade?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The lower-level window on the left side of the cabin is a minor but identifiable detail. It contributes to the balance of the façade and helps distinguish this cabin from others. While not as critical as the garage or deck, its presence adds visual coherence. Its removal or relocation would create an imbalance and reduce fidelity to the original.
    Question: Is the small rectangular window located on the lower level, to the left of the main entrance, still present?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
}

{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The stone retaining wall on the right side of the cabin, composed of large boulders, is a specific environmental detail that grounds the structure in its setting. While the instruction allows changes to the ground, preserving this feature maintains contextual authenticity. It is a secondary detail but contributes to the overall realism and scene consistency.
    Question: Is the stone retaining wall made of large, irregular boulders visible on the right side of the cabin's base?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 1
