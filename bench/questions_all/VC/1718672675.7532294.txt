Description of reference image: The subject is a dramatic coastal cliffside landscape viewed from an elevated vantage point, with the sun low on the horizon casting a golden reflection across the calm sea. The cliffs are composed of layered sedimentary rock formations, exhibiting vertical striations and natural erosion patterns, with varying shades of tan, brown, and gray. Vegetation in the form of shrubs and small trees clings to the slopes and crevices of the rocks, particularly along the top edges and scattered patches. The foreground features large, weathered boulders and uneven terrain with grassy patches. The water below is dark blue-green with gentle ripples, reflecting sunlight in a bright, elongated path toward the viewer. A few small boats are visible far out on the water. The sky is partly cloudy with soft, diffused clouds near the horizon and deeper blue tones above, indicating either sunrise or sunset lighting conditions. The overall composition emphasizes depth, scale, and natural serenity.

Thinking process: First, analyze the editing instructions word by word. The instruction states: "Transform the cliffside into a mythical titan creature emerging from the rock face." This indicates that the **form** of the cliffside (i.e., its shape and structure) is allowed to be altered fundamentally — it can become a creature. However, this does not imply that all visual content must be changed; rather, it specifies a transformation *of* the cliffside, suggesting that the original material (rock, vegetation, etc.) may be reinterpreted or reshaped into new forms.

Next: "Turn jagged rock formations into armor plating" — this allows for reinterpretation of existing rock textures and shapes into armored segments, meaning the **texture and position** of rock can be modified but likely retains some original geological characteristics.

"Shape the water below into flowing spectral limbs" — this means the water’s form and function are to be transformed into limbs, so the **liquid surface and its reflective properties** are subject to change.

"Small trees forming textured mane" — trees are to be reimagined as part of a mane, implying their **position and form** can be altered, but they must still exist in the scene and contribute to the new design.

"Carve runes into the rock surface" — runes are new elements added to the rock, so the rock surface remains present but gains inscriptions.

"Replace clouds with ethereal, twisting spirits spiraling around the titan's form" — this explicitly replaces the cloud formation, so the sky background is allowed to change.

Thus, **allowed changes** include:
- The structural form of the cliffside (to become a titan)
- The shape and movement of the water (into spectral limbs)
- The role and appearance of trees (as mane)
- The sky/clouds (replaced with spirits)
- Addition of runes on rock
- Reinterpretation of rock textures as armor

However, these transformations are applied *to* existing elements, meaning certain **underlying physical properties** must remain consistent with the original image unless explicitly stated otherwise. For example, while the cliff becomes a titan, it must still originate from the same location and maintain spatial coherence with the original landscape. Similarly, while the water becomes limbs, it must still occupy the same general area and connect logically to the cliff base.

Allowed Changes List:
- The overall form and silhouette of the cliffside (transformed into a titan)
- The shape and motion of the water (transformed into spectral limbs)
- The configuration and function of trees (reused as mane)
- The cloud formations (replaced with spirits)
- Rock texture interpretation (as armor plating)
- Addition of runes on rock surfaces
- Color and lighting adjustments due to transformation (e.g., ethereal glow)

Thinking process:
Core recognition elements: In this image, there are no iconic symbols from famous artworks or characters. Instead, the core identity lies in the **natural landscape elements** — specifically, the **cliffside’s geology**, the **sunlight reflection on water**, and the **spatial relationship between land and sea**. These define the original scene’s identity. While the cliffside can be transformed into a titan, the **original rock layers, erosion patterns, and cliff edge positioning** must still be recognizable within the new form to preserve the transformation logic. Otherwise, the edit would not be grounded in the source image.

Functional/logical association elements: The **relative positioning** of the cliffside to the sea and the sun must be preserved — the cliff must still overhang the water, and the sun must still appear on the horizon at the same angle. If the water becomes limbs, they must extend from the base of the cliff, maintaining continuity. The **boats on the water** must still be present, even if stylized, because they provide scale and context; removing them would disrupt environmental realism.

Non-modified element deduction: After excluding allowed changes (transformation of cliff into titan, water into limbs, etc.), the following **unmentioned details** must remain:
- The **presence of vegetation** on the cliff (shrubs and small trees), though repurposed as mane
- The **texture and layering of rock** (even if turned into armor)
- The **general color palette** of earthy browns and blues
- The **direction of light** (sunrise/sunset glow from the left)
- The **foreground boulders and grassy patches**
- The **water’s reflective path** (though now spectral)

These elements are not explicitly mentioned for change but are foundational to the original image’s visual integrity. Changing them without reason would break continuity.

Preservation Targets List:
- The presence and distribution of vegetation (trees and shrubs) on the cliff
- The layered sedimentary rock structure of the cliff
- The position and direction of the sun’s reflection on the water
- The presence of small boats on the water
- The foreground rocky terrain with grass and boulders
- The relative height and slope of the cliff edge
- The color tone of the sky and water (golden-hued horizon, blue-gray sea)

Q1:  
Thinking process: The layered sedimentary rock structure is a defining feature of the cliffside in the original image, characterized by horizontal strata and vertical erosion lines. These layers are key to identifying the geological nature of the cliff. Even if transformed into armor plating, the underlying pattern of stratification should be preserved to maintain visual coherence with the original. Losing this would make the transformation feel arbitrary and disconnected from the source. Thus, the presence of distinct rock layers is a core visual identifier, warranting 3 points.

Question: Are distinct horizontal sedimentary layers visible in the rock face of the cliff?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q2:  
Thinking process: The sun’s reflection on the water forms a bright, elongated path extending from the horizon toward the viewer. This is a critical lighting feature that defines the time of day and atmospheric mood. Although the water may be transformed into spectral limbs, the reflection must still originate from the same sun position and follow a similar trajectory to maintain spatial logic. Its absence would break the lighting consistency of the scene, making the edit feel disjointed. Hence, this is an important scene element worth 2 points.

Question: Is there a bright, linear reflection of the sun visible on the water surface extending from the horizon?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q3:  
Thinking process: The presence of small boats on the water provides scale and realism to the scene. They are minor but meaningful elements that ground the landscape in reality. Even if the water becomes spectral limbs, the boats should still be present, perhaps floating on or near the limbs, to preserve environmental continuity. Removing them would diminish the sense of place and scale. Therefore, their presence is a secondary detail that affects coherence, assigned 1 point.

Question: Are there multiple small boats visible on the water surface in the distance?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 1  

Q4:  
Thinking process: The vegetation — particularly shrubs and small trees — grows along the cliff edges and slopes. These plants are integral to the natural ecosystem depicted and help define the texture of the landscape. Though the instruction says trees will form a mane, they must still be located in the same areas (top and sides of cliffs) to maintain spatial fidelity. Their absence would make the transformation feel ungrounded. Thus, their presence in those locations is essential, worth 2 points.

Question: Are shrubs and small trees growing along the upper edges and crevices of the cliff?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q5:  
Thinking process: The foreground contains large, weathered boulders and patches of grass, forming a natural pathway or slope leading down toward the cliff edge. These elements establish depth and perspective. Even if the entire cliff becomes a titan, the foreground terrain must retain its rocky, grassy character to maintain visual continuity. Altering this would disrupt the viewer’s entry point into the scene. This is a key compositional element, assigned 2 points.

Question: Are large, irregular boulders and grassy patches present in the foreground near the cliff edge?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2  

Q6:  
Thinking process: The sun is positioned low on the horizon, casting a warm glow across the sky and water. This specific lighting condition — sunrise or sunset — is crucial to the atmosphere and color balance. While the sky may be replaced with spirits, the sun’s position and the resulting warm light gradient must remain consistent to preserve the time-of-day context. This is a core lighting element, worth 3 points.

Question: Is the sun located low on the horizon, emitting a warm golden glow across the sky and water?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 3  

Q7:  
Thinking process: The cliff edge maintains a steep, continuous drop-off into the water, forming a clear boundary between land and sea. This spatial relationship is fundamental to the scene’s structure. Even if the cliff becomes a titan, the edge must still descend sharply into the water to maintain logical geography. Disrupting this would create a disorienting or illogical layout. This is a functional spatial element, worth 2 points.

Question: Does the cliff edge form a steep, continuous drop-off directly into the water below?  
Choices: Yes, No  
A: Yes  
Weight: 2
