Description of reference image: The subject is a composite image featuring the Statue of Liberty, the Eiffel Tower, and the London Eye. The Statue of Liberty is centrally positioned, holding a torch aloft in her right hand and a tablet in her left. The Eiffel Tower stands to the right, showcasing its intricate metal framework. The London Eye, a large Ferris wheel, is visible on the left. The background consists of a clear blue sky with scattered clouds and some greenery along the waterline.

Thinking process:  
The editing instructions specify designing an anime-inspired badge incorporating the Statue of Liberty, the Eiffel Tower, and the London Eye, with tassels added as a design element. A hand holding the badge is to be prominently featured in the foreground. This means the original forms of the landmarks can be transformed into stylized versions suitable for a badge, and the scene can be replaced. However, the core iconic features of these landmarks must be retained for recognition.

Allowed Changes List:  
- The form of the landmarks can be transformed into a stylized badge design.  
- The scene can be replaced with a new background appropriate for the badge.  
- The addition of tassels and a hand holding the badge.  

Step 2 - Determine the elements that should remain unchanged  
Thinking process:  
Core recognition elements include the distinctive shapes and features of the Statue of Liberty, the Eiffel Tower, and the London Eye, which must be recognizable even in a stylized form. Functional/logical association elements include the relative positions of these landmarks on the badge, ensuring they are logically grouped together. Remaining elements like the waterline and greenery are not critical and can be omitted.

Preservation Targets List:  
- The recognizable silhouette and features of the Statue of Liberty.  
- The recognizable structure and framework of the Eiffel Tower.  
- The circular shape and gondolas of the London Eye.  
- The relative positioning of the landmarks on the badge.
