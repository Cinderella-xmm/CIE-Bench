Description of reference image: The image features three giraffes standing on a grassy field under a clear blue sky. The giraffes exhibit their characteristic long necks, patterned coats with brown patches outlined in white, and small ossicones on their heads. They stand in a natural pose, with their legs extended and bodies upright. The background consists of lush green trees and scattered rocks, contributing to a serene outdoor setting.

### Step 1 - Allowed Changes List:

Thinking process: The instructions specify transforming the giraffes into a whimsical caricature style, emphasizing their elongated necks and distinct facial traits. This implies that the proportions of the giraffes, particularly their necks and faces, can be exaggerated. However, the background must remain unchanged.

Allowed Changes List:
Specific element 1 that allows for changes: The proportions of the giraffes, especially their necks and faces, can be exaggerated for a caricature effect.
Specific element 2 that allows for changes: The overall style of the giraffes can be altered to a whimsical, cartoonish appearance.

### Step 2 - Preservation Targets List:

Thinking process:
Core recognition elements: The brown and white mesh patterns on the giraffes are essential for their identification. The ossicones on their heads and their general body structure also contribute to their recognizability. The background, including the grassy field, trees, and rocks, must remain consistent as per the instructions.

Functional/logical association elements: The positioning of the giraffes relative to the background must be maintained to preserve the scene's logic.

Non-modified element deduction: Details like the giraffes' leg structure and the natural posture should be retained for visual coherence.

Preservation Targets List:
(Element 1 that should be maintained): Brown and white mesh patterns on the giraffes.
(Element 2 that should be maintained): Presence of ossicones on the giraffes' heads.
(Element 3 that should be maintained): Natural positioning of the giraffes relative to the background.
(Element 4 that should be maintained): Grass, trees, and rocks in the background.
(Element 5 that should be maintained): General body structure of the giraffes.

### Step 3 - Question Generation:

Q1:  
Thinking process: The brown and white mesh patterns are crucial for identifying the giraffes. Losing this pattern would make them unrecognizable, hence it is a core identity feature.
Question: Are the brown and white mesh patterns visible on the giraffes?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
Weight: 3

Q2:  
Thinking process: The ossicones are a distinctive feature of giraffes and contribute significantly to their identity. Their absence would alter the giraffe's recognizable appearance.
Question: Are the ossicones present on the giraffes' heads?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
Weight: 3

Q3:  
Thinking process: The natural positioning of the giraffes relative to the background maintains the scene's logic and coherence. Altering this could disrupt the visual consistency.
Question: Are the giraffes positioned naturally relative to the grassy field and trees in the background?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
Weight: 2

Q4:  
Thinking process: The background elements like grass, trees, and rocks are specified to be retained. Their presence ensures the scene remains consistent with the original.
Question: Is the background composed of grass, trees, and rocks?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
Weight: 2

Q5:  
Thinking process: The general body structure of the giraffes, including their legs and torso, contributes to their overall appearance. While some exaggeration is allowed, the basic structure should remain intact.
Question: Does the general body structure of the giraffes, including their legs and torso, remain intact?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes
Weight: 1
