**Description of reference image:** The subject consists of two bright red apples placed closely together on a wooden surface. The apples have a shiny, smooth texture with small white speckles and hints of yellow near the stems. They are illuminated by natural light coming from a nearby window, which is softly visible in the blurred background along with some out-of-focus greenery. The wooden surface has a natural, rustic appearance with visible grain lines and knots.

### Step 1 - Allowed Changes List:

**Thinking process:** Analyze the elements that can be altered based on given instructions:  
- Adding text "Fresh" at the bottom left and "Sweet" at the top right implies that text placement, font style, and size can be adjusted.  
- Since the instructions focus on transforming this into a minimalist fruit brand poster, there’s an allowance for slight adjustments to lighting or contrast for enhancing the "minimalist" feel.  

**Allowed Changes List:**  
- Text addition ("Fresh" and "Sweet") including their design, positioning, and typography.  
- Minor adjustments to lighting and contrast for a more poster-like aesthetic.

### Step 2 - Elements That Should Remain Unchanged:

**Thinking process:** Determine elements critical for maintaining core identity, functionality, and coherence:  
- **Core recognition elements:** The vibrant red color, smooth texture, white speckles, and shape of the apples are essential for recognizing them as fresh fruits.  
- **Functional/logical association elements:** The natural light source and its interaction with the apples’ surfaces create realistic depth and appeal, preserving the fresh quality.  
- **Other retained elements:** The rustic wooden texture beneath and the soft background blur create context for a natural setting.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
(Element 1 that should be maintained: Apples' vibrant red color and white speckles)  
(Element 2 that should be maintained: Shape and smooth texture of the apples)  
(Element 3 that should be maintained: Natural lighting and reflections on apple surfaces)  
(Element 4 that should be maintained: Rustic wooden table texture)  
(Element 5 that should be maintained: Soft background blur with natural elements)
