      "thinking_process": "The U.S. $20 bill is a core identifier in the image, distinguished by its green color, the large blue-green \"20\" numeral, and the architectural design resembling the White House. This specific combination is iconic and necessary for recognizing the denomination and currency. If these features are lost or altered, the note cannot be identified as a U.S. $20 bill, which undermines the educational purpose of the infographic. Therefore, this element is critical and weighs 3 points.",

      "thinking_process": "The Qatari Riyal note is uniquely identified by its pink-orange color, Arabic script, and the serial number \"103 01\". These features distinguish it from other Middle Eastern currencies. Since the infographic aims to represent real-world currencies, altering or removing these features would misrepresent the currency. Hence, this is a high-priority retention element with a weight of 3.",

These are national symbols and key identifiers. Losing them would make the note unrecognizable as Indian currency, which is essential for the infographic’s accuracy. This is a core identity feature, thus weighted at 3.",

      "thinking_process": "The U.S. $1 bill is identifiable by the portrait of George Washington and the text \"ONE DOLLAR\". Although partially obscured, its presence is crucial for showing multiple U.S. denominations. Its inclusion helps establish the U.S. currency section in the infographic. While not as prominent, its absence would alter the currency set represented, so it is an important element with a weight of 2.",

      "thinking_process": "The arrangement of multiple banknotes in a single container (the wallet) implies a collection of international currencies. Even though the wallet is transformed into a blueprint, the **grouping of these four specific notes** must be preserved to maintain the original intent of showcasing diverse currencies. The co-presence of USD, QAR, and INR is a functional relationship that supports the educational theme. Thus, this grouping is important but not visually unique per se, hence weighted at 2.",

While the infographic may simplify colors, the original hues are essential for accurate identification. Changing them arbitrarily could mislead viewers. This is a detail-level but significant element, so it is assigned 1 point.",
