Description of reference image: The subject is a character standing on a beach under a vibrant blue sky, with seagulls flying around. He sports a straw hat with a red band, tousled black hair peeking out beneath it, a red open-collared coat revealing his muscular torso, a yellow sash tied at the waist, and blue shorts with a furry trim at the hem. His expression is cheerful, with wide eyes and an open-mouthed smile, and his right hand is raised to adjust the straw hat. The background depicts a serene seascape with shimmering blue waters and fluffy white clouds scattered across the sky.
