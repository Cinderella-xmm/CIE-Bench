**Step 1 – Analyze Editing Instructions and Determine Allowed Changes**

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a muscular Black male figure seated in a meditative pose, facing forward with a neutral expression. He has a full beard and voluminous, tightly coiled afro-style hair. On his head is an ornate golden headdress shaped like a crown or mask, featuring intricate geometric patterns and a central diamond-shaped motif. His ears are adorned with long, dangling earrings made of gold with tassels. Around his neck is a layered, elaborate gold necklace composed of interlocking shapes resembling stylized wings or feathers, extending down to the chest. The figure is bare-chested, revealing defined pectoral, abdominal, and arm muscles. His arms rest on his thighs, palms upward, with visible bracelets on both wrists. He wears a dark, draped garment around the lower body. The background consists of an arched, circular structure with swirling, flame-like orange and amber hues, suggesting a mystical or divine atmosphere. Abstract architectural elements and faint silhouettes of figures or symbols are embedded within the glowing backdrop, contributing to a sense of sacred space.

**Thinking process:**  
The editing instruction explicitly states:  
- Transform the image into a **baroque sculpture**, implying a shift in medium and style but not necessarily identity.  
- Depict the subject as a **powerful deity**, which allows for thematic reimagining but does not alter the core subject’s form or posture.  
- Enhance the **texture of the hair** into **intricately detailed marble curls** — this changes the texture and material of the hair, so hair texture is allowed to change.  
- Adorn the **neck and shoulders** with **ornate ornamental carvings** — this means new sculptural details can be added to these areas, so the existing jewelry may be modified or replaced.  
- Modify the **background** into an **elaborate bas-relief with angelic figures** — this clearly permits replacement of the current background.  
- Use a **monochrome palette to mimic polished white marble** — this changes color entirely, so all original colors are subject to change.

From this, we infer:
- **Hair texture**: Can be changed (from natural curls to marble curls).
- **Necklace/shoulder adornments**: Can be altered or enhanced with carvings.
- **Background**: Entirely replaceable.
- **Color scheme**: Must become monochrome (white marble), so all original colors are removed.
- **Subject’s posture and identity**: Not stated to change; thus, the **overall form, facial features, and pose** must remain recognizable despite stylistic transformation.

Allowed Changes List:  
- Texture of hair (natural → marble curls)  
- Necklace and shoulder ornamentation (can be expanded or redesigned as carvings)  
- Background (replaced with bas-relief containing angelic figures)  
- Color palette (changed to monochrome white marble)  
- Material rendering (from painted skin and gold to stone sculpture)

**Step 2 – Determine Elements That Should Remain Unchanged**

**Thinking process:**  
We now apply exclusion based on the "Allowed Changes List" to determine what **must be retained**.

**Core recognition elements:**  
- The **subject’s face** — particularly the **facial structure**, **beard**, **eyes**, **nose**, and **lips** — are essential for identifying the individual. Even if rendered in marble, the underlying facial identity must be preserved. A baroque sculpture still needs to represent the same person.
- The **pose** — seated cross-legged, hands resting on knees, palms up — is a key compositional feature that defines the subject's presence and intent. Changing it would alter the narrative stance.
- The **muscular anatomy** — especially the definition of the pectorals, abs, and arms — is part of the subject’s visual identity and must remain intact to maintain physical realism under the sculpture transformation.
- The **presence of the headdress** — although its texture may change, its **shape and placement** (central diamond motif, crown-like structure) must remain because it is a defining accessory and symbol of status/divinity.

**Functional/logical association elements:**  
- The **relationship between the subject and the environment** — while the background is being replaced, the **subject remains centrally framed and seated**, maintaining spatial logic. The position relative to the archway (implied by the original background) should persist, even if the arch becomes a bas-relief.
- The **hand position** — palms up in meditation — is functionally significant and conveys serenity or power; changing it would affect the symbolic meaning.

**Non-modified element deduction:**  
After excluding allowed changes:
- The **headdress shape** (not just texture) must stay.
- The **facial features** (eyes, nose, mouth, beard) must remain identifiable.
- The **body proportions and musculature** must be preserved.
- The **posture and hand orientation** must be maintained.
- The **presence of earrings** — though they may become carved, their **position and general form** should remain, as they are part of the original aesthetic.
- The **draped garment** at the lower body — its **existence and basic silhouette** should be kept, even if rendered in marble.

Preservation Targets List:  
- Facial structure (eyes, nose, mouth, beard)  
- Seated pose with hands resting palms-up on thighs  
- Muscular torso anatomy (abs, pectorals, arms)  
- Headdress shape and placement (crown-like, central diamond motif)  
- Earrings’ position and form (dangling from ears)  
- Draped garment at lower body  
- Central framing within an arch-like structure (spatial relationship)

**Step 3 – Generate Yes/No Questions Based on Key Visual Elements**

{
    Q1: 
    Thinking process: The facial features—specifically the eyes, nose, mouth, and beard—are the primary identifiers of the subject’s identity. In any transformation, especially one involving a deity or sculpture, the face must remain recognizable to preserve the core identity. Loss of these features would make the figure unidentifiable as the original subject. This is a 3-point element due to its critical role in identity recognition.
    Question: Does the edited image retain the original facial structure, including the eyes, nose, mouth, and full beard?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q2: 
    Thinking process: The seated pose with hands resting palms-up on the thighs is a functional and symbolic posture that defines the subject’s demeanor and spiritual state. It is a key compositional element that must remain unchanged to preserve the narrative context. Altering this would fundamentally change the subject’s presentation and disrupt continuity.
    Question: Is the subject depicted in the same seated pose with hands resting palms-up on the thighs?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q3: 
    Thinking process: The headdress is a distinctive cultural and symbolic object, with a specific crown-like shape and central diamond motif. While its texture may change to marble, its form and placement must remain consistent to maintain visual continuity. Its loss or alteration would undermine the subject’s regal or divine status as established in the original.
    Question: Is the headdress present in the same shape and position on the head, with the central diamond motif clearly visible?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 3
}

{
    Q4: 
    Thinking process: The earrings are prominent accessories that contribute to the subject’s identity and aesthetic. Their position and form (dangling with tassels) are unique to the original image. Even if rendered in stone, their presence and location must be preserved to maintain consistency with the original design.
    Question: Are the earrings still present, dangling from the ears in the same position and form?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q5: 
    Thinking process: The draped garment at the lower body is a secondary but important detail that completes the subject’s attire and maintains visual balance. While its texture may change, its existence and silhouette must be preserved to avoid visual incompleteness or misrepresentation.
    Question: Is the draped garment still present around the lower body, maintaining its original silhouette?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q6: 
    Thinking process: The muscular anatomy—particularly the defined abs, pectorals, and arms—is a key feature of the subject’s physicality. Even in a sculptural form, the underlying musculature must be accurately represented to preserve the subject’s strength and presence. Any distortion would compromise the integrity of the original depiction.
    Question: Are the defined abdominal muscles, pectorals, and arm musculature still clearly visible and proportionally accurate?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
}

{
    Q7: 
    Thinking process: The central framing within an arch-like structure is a spatial element that anchors the composition. Although the background is being replaced, the subject must remain centered within a similar arch form to preserve the original spatial logic and symmetry. This is a key scene element that supports the overall coherence.
    Question: Is the subject still framed within a central arch-like structure, maintaining the original spatial composition?
    Choices: Yes, No
    A: Yes
    Weight: 2
