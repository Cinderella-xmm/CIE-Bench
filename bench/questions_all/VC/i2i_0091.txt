Description of reference image:  
The image shows a minimalistic room setup featuring a large wall-mounted wooden clock with clean, black hour markers and hands, placed above a wooden chest of drawers. The chest has six drawers and is positioned against a neutral-colored wall. On top of the chest are decorative items including white vases with plants or branches, a stack of books, and small spherical objects. The floor is tiled with a light wood parquet design. The overall scene is lit by soft natural light coming from an unseen source, casting visible shadows.

### Step 1 - Analyze Allowed Changes:

Thinking process:  
The editing instruction transforms the scene into a castle hall while retaining the original lighting style. This means we can alter the specific furniture, wall design, and decor. However, the light's direction, intensity, and the way it creates shadows must stay consistent.

Allowed Changes List:  
- Change the wooden cabinet to match the interior of a castle hall.  
- Replace the wall clock with something fitting a castle hall theme.  
- Alter the decorative items on the chest of drawers to fit the castle hall aesthetic.  
- Adjust the wall and floor designs accordingly.

Preservation Targets List:
