      "thinking_process": "The transparent tank is the most distinctive feature of the vape device in the original image. It allows visibility of the liquid inside, distinguishing it from opaque devices. This is essential for identifying the device type and demonstrating liquid level in the comic. Loss of this feature would make the device unidentifiable and undermine the educational purpose of the comic. Thus, it is a core identity element.",
      "question": "Is the transparent tank section of the vape device clearly visible, allowing the internal liquid to be seen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The black mouthpiece and cap are iconic components that define the top portion of the device. Their presence confirms the device’s inhalation mechanism. Changing or omitting them would alter the device’s functional appearance and make it visually inconsistent with real-world vaping devices. This is a key functional element.",
      "question": "Is the black mouthpiece and cap at the top of the vape device present and correctly positioned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The visible coil structure at the base is critical for illustrating the heating mechanism. It is a defining technical feature of modern vape devices. In the cross-section panel, this must be shown to explain vaporization. Removing or distorting it would misrepresent the device’s function.",
      "question": "Is the coil component located at the base of the device, visible through the transparent tank?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 3
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The liquid inside the tank is essential for demonstrating the device’s operation. The presence and level of liquid indicate how much e-liquid remains and how it interacts with the coil. Omitting it would make the device appear empty or non-functional, breaking the educational narrative.",
      "question": "Is the liquid inside the transparent tank clearly visible and present at a measurable level?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The relative positioning of the coil, liquid, and battery (implied by device shape) defines the internal logic. Even in a diagram, the coil must be below the liquid and above the battery to show proper flow. Misalignment would violate physical principles and reduce credibility.",
      "question": "Are the internal components (coil, liquid, battery) arranged in a logically consistent vertical alignment within the device?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The airflow path is inferred from the device’s design, especially the inlet holes near the base. While not always visible, its presence is necessary for explaining how air flows through the device. In the cross-section, it must be indicated to show vapor generation.",
      "question": "Is an airflow pathway indicated or implied in the device’s structure, such as an inlet near the base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
