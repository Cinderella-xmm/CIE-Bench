### Step 1 - Allowed Changes List

**Description of reference image:**  
The subject is a spiral-bound notebook with a purple and white cover featuring the text "XML Application Platform xfy." The notebook is positioned upright next to a black wireless mouse on a neutral beige surface. The notebook has a distinct purple upper section and a white lower section, with bold white text on the purple area. The mouse is sleek and modern, placed to the right of the notebook.

**Thinking process:**  
The instructions clearly state transforming the notebook into an anthropomorphic anime girl, changing the scene to a manga-style workspace, and altering the mouse's context. Therefore, the notebook's physical form and the current scene can be changed. However, certain elements like the notebook's color scheme and text must be retained in the new character design.

**Allowed Changes List:**  
1. Notebook's physical form transformed into an anime character.  
2. Scene changed to a manga-style workspace with specified settings.  
3. Mouse's function and interaction reimagined in the new context.

### Step 2 - Preservation Targets List

**Thinking process:**  
Core recognition elements include the notebook's purple and white color scheme and the text "XML Application Platform xfy," which must be reflected in the new character design. Functional/logical elements include the mouse as an interactive object, which should still be recognizable. Remaining elements like the notebook's spiral binding can be retained for visual coherence.

**Preservation Targets List:**  
1. Purple and white color scheme of the notebook.  
2. Text "XML Application Platform xfy" on the character's design.  
3. Spiral binding detail of the notebook.  
4. Black wireless mouse as an interactive object.
