      "thinking_process": "The golden-yellow eye color is a core recognition feature of the character Larxene. In the original image, her eyes are distinctly golden-yellow, which is a signature trait used to identify her across the Kingdom Hearts series. Changing this would fundamentally alter her identity. Since the instruction does not specify changing eye color, and given that eye color is a fixed biological trait in character design, it should be retained. Losing this would make the character unrecognizable, hence it is a key element with a weight of 3 points.",
      "question": "Does the character retain the golden-yellow eye color?",

        "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The facial structure, including the jawline, cheekbones, and nose shape, is a core identity feature. These elements define the character’s distinct look and are consistent across appearances in the series. Altering them would result in a different character. Since the instruction does not specify modifying the face, and facial structure is critical for recognition, it must be preserved. This is a key identity element, thus weighted at 3 points.",
      "question": "Is the character’s facial structure (jawline, cheekbones, nose shape) preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The skin tone and texture are consistent with the character’s design in the original image. Light peach-toned skin with smooth texture is part of her visual identity. Changing it to a darker or paler tone would disrupt visual consistency and recognition. While not as iconic as eyes or face, it is a key detail for accurate representation. Therefore, it is a secondary but important element, weighted at 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the character’s skin tone and texture preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The character’s body proportions and stance (upright, arms slightly out, head turned slightly) are essential for maintaining the original pose and spatial relationship. The instruction does not mention altering the pose, so it should be retained for logical consistency. Changing the stance would affect the character’s presence and narrative context. This is an important scene-related element, thus weighted at 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the character’s body proportions and stance preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The camera angle and lighting direction (frontal three-quarter view with soft diffuse lighting) are crucial for maintaining visual coherence. The lighting highlights the face and clothing details, and the angle provides clear visibility of the character. Changing these would alter the mood and perspective significantly. Although not a core identity feature, they are essential for scene consistency. Thus, this is a minor but important detail, weighted at 1 point.",
      "question": "Is the camera angle and lighting direction preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The relative positioning of the character to the background (centered, facing forward) is important for spatial logic. Even though the background is to be changed, the character’s position within the frame should remain consistent to maintain compositional balance. This ensures that the transformation feels coherent rather than disjointed. This is a scene-level detail, affecting overall consistency, thus weighted at 2 points.",
      "question": "Is the character’s relative position to the background preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
