      "thinking_process": "The steeple with a cross at the top is the most iconic feature of a church, serving as a primary identifier. In the original image, the cross is clearly visible atop a pointed steeple. Even in a whimsical animation style, the presence of a cross on a tall spire is essential for maintaining the church's identity. Removing or replacing it would render the structure unrecognizable as a church. This is a core identity element, hence weighted at 3 points.",
      "question": "Is there a cross at the very top of the church's steeple?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The arched doorway with warm interior light is a defining functional feature of the church, indicating entry and suggesting warmth or sanctity. Its position at the front center of the building is critical for spatial recognition. Even if stylized, this feature must remain present and lit to preserve the building’s purpose and orientation. Loss of this element would disrupt both identity and logic, making it a high-priority retention target. Weight assigned: 3 points.",
      "question": "Is there a glowing arched doorway located at the front center of the church?",

        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The winding dirt path leading directly to the church is a key compositional and logical element. It connects the viewer to the building and maintains narrative flow. While its texture might be stylized, its existence and trajectory from the foreground to the church steps must be preserved. Without it, the scene loses directional coherence and context. This is a major scene element affecting overall consistency, thus weighted at 2 points.",
      "question": "Is there a winding dirt path extending from the foreground toward the church’s entrance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The large stained-glass window above the arched doorway is a distinctive architectural feature, unique in position and design. It contributes to the church’s aesthetic and symbolic identity. Although the instruction allows for vibrant colors, the window's location and shape must remain consistent. Changing its position or removing it would alter the building’s recognizable facade. This is an important accessory element, crucial for identification, hence weighted at 2 points.",
      "question": "Is there a large arched stained-glass window positioned directly above the main entrance?",

      "thinking_process": "The side windows on either side of the doorway and the additional window on the side wall are structural details that define the church’s symmetry and volume. Their presence ensures the building appears balanced and complete. While their shapes may be simplified, their positions must remain consistent to preserve architectural logic. These are secondary but necessary details for visual coherence, thus weighted at 1 point.",
      "question": "Are there two narrow windows flanking the main doorway and one additional window visible on the side wall of the church?",
