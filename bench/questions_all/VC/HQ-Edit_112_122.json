      "thinking_process": "The red-to-blue gradient in the dress is the most distinctive visual feature of the subject. It defines the dress’s identity and aesthetic. If the gradient is lost or replaced with uniform color, the dress becomes unrecognizable as the original. This is a core identity element, hence weight 3.",
      "question": "Is the dress clearly divided into a red upper section and a dark blue lower section, forming a visible gradient?",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The swirling motion of the dress is tied directly to the woman’s pose and conveys the scene’s dynamism. If the dress is flat or static, the illusion of movement collapses. This is a critical functional element linking pose and clothing, so it must be preserved. Weight 3.",
      "question": "Does the dress appear to be in motion, with the fabric fanning outward and upward as if caught in a twirl?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The woman’s pose—arms extended, one hand lifting the skirt—is iconic to the scene. Altering it would break the narrative of dancing or floating. This is a core action element essential to the image’s identity. Weight 3.",
      "question": "Is the woman’s right arm extended forward and her left arm raised, with her left hand lifting the edge of the dress?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The golden-brown hair is a defining trait of the character. Its length, wave, and light interaction contribute to her elegance and distinguish her from other figures. Removing or changing its color would affect recognition. Weight 2.",
      "question": "Does the woman have long, wavy, golden-brown hair flowing behind her?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "thinking_process": "The pink and yellow floral clusters are key environmental identifiers. Their presence and placement (pink on left, yellow on right) establish the garden’s symmetry and richness. Removing them would destroy the setting’s identity. Weight 2.",
      "question": "Are there dense clusters of pink flowers on the left side and yellow spherical flowers on the right side of the scene?",

      "thinking_process": "The lighting from the top right creates contrast and mood. It is explicitly mentioned in the instructions and must be preserved. Its absence would disrupt the ethereal quality. Weight 2.",
      "question": "Is there a bright, warm light source coming from the top right, illuminating the woman and casting a golden glow on the right side of the scene?",

      "thinking_process": "The woman’s closed eyes and slight smile convey serenity and joy. The silver hoop earring adds detail and realism. These are minor but important identity markers. Losing them would reduce fidelity. Weight 1.",
      "question": "Does the woman have closed eyes, a gentle smile, and a visible silver hoop earring on her left ear?",
