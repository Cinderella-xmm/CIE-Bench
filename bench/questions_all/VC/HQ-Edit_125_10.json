      "thinking_process": "The dragon-headed prow is a defining iconographic feature of Viking longships, serving as a primary identifier. Its presence, shape, and ornate carving distinguish it from other ship types. If removed or altered beyond recognition, the vessel would no longer be identifiable as a Viking ship, making it a core identity element. Thus, its retention is critical.",
      "question": "Is the dragon-headed prow with detailed carvings and open jaws present at the front of the ship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "thinking_process": "The circular knotwork emblem on the sail is a unique decorative element that appears prominently in the original model and is explicitly referenced in the instruction to be used as a game board layout. This means its visual design must be preserved exactly. Losing this pattern would break the continuity between the original model and the game design, undermining the transformation logic.",
      "question": "Is the dark red and black circular knotwork emblem centered on the beige sail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "thinking_process": "The shields along the gunwale are not only decorative but historically significant, representing Viking ship defenses. Each shield has a unique symbol, contributing to the model’s individuality. Since the instruction references creating mini figures modeled after rowers, the presence and arrangement of these shields are necessary for accurate representation. Altering them would distort the ship’s appearance.",
      "question": "Are multiple circular shields with distinct symbols mounted along the side of the ship beneath the oars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "thinking_process": "The rower figures and oars are functional elements that define the ship’s operation and are directly referenced for use in game miniatures. Their number, positioning, and attachment to the hull are critical for maintaining the ship’s operational logic. Removing or changing them would misrepresent the vessel’s design.",
      "question": "Are there multiple oars extending outward from the hull, each connected to a small human-like figure representing a rower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "thinking_process": "The layered wooden planking of the hull is a structural and aesthetic hallmark of Viking shipbuilding. It provides authenticity and visual texture that distinguishes it from other vessels. Since the instruction emphasizes historical authenticity and wooden texture accents, the original wood grain and plank layering must be preserved in the artwork.",
      "question": "Does the hull consist of clearly defined horizontal wooden planks with visible grain and layered construction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes",
      "weight": 2
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "thinking_process": "The central mast and square sail configuration are essential to the ship’s silhouette and functionality. The sail is not just a surface but a key component of the vessel’s design, especially since it is repurposed as a game board. Its shape, size, and attachment point must remain consistent to maintain structural coherence.",
      "question": "Is there a single central mast supporting a square-shaped sail that is fully unfurled and attached via ropes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
