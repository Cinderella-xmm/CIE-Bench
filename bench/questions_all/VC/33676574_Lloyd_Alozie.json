      "thinking_process": "The Address Downtown tower's golden lattice framework is a core architectural identifier. It features a series of X-shaped supports forming a repeating pattern across its upper sections, which is unique to this building. If this lattice is removed or replaced without preserving its outline, the building becomes unrecognizable. Thus, its **presence and structural shape** must be preserved as a key identity marker. This is a 3-point element because it is central to identifying the location and the specific building within the skyline.",

      "thinking_process": "The Emaar Tower has a smooth cylindrical body with a curved top and a horizontal band of lights near the middle. This shape distinguishes it from surrounding towers. Even if transformed into a robotic limb, its **cylindrical volume and curvature** must remain to maintain architectural continuity. Altering these would confuse viewers about the building’s identity. This is a 3-point element due to its role in skyline recognition.",

      "thinking_process": "The relative positioning of the Address Downtown tower to the left of the Emaar Tower is critical for spatial coherence. If their positions are swapped or distorted, the viewer loses orientation. This spatial relationship is a functional element that maintains logical consistency in the city layout. It is a 2-point element because it affects overall scene accuracy but not individual building identity.",

      "thinking_process": "The low-rise traditional-style buildings in the foreground have beige walls, arched windows, and flat roofs, representing Dubai’s cultural architecture. Their presence grounds the scene and contrasts with the modern towers. Removing them or altering their style would eliminate a key contextual layer. They are not core identity markers but are important for environmental realism. This is a 2-point element.",

Its **distinctive roof shape** and **position beneath the towers** are essential for identifying the area. Even if stylized, its **outline and location** must be retained.
