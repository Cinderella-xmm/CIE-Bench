### Description of Reference Image:
The subject is a man dressed in a white lab coat over a light blue shirt, standing beside a control panel with multiple colored buttons and a monitor displaying a diagram. He has short brown hair, a beard, and is smiling slightly. His hand rests on the control panel. The background is a plain white wall, giving a clean and professional laboratory setting.

### Thinking Process:
The instructions clearly state transforming the subject into a chibi-style design with six distinct poses, altering his appearance significantly. However, certain core elements must remain consistent to preserve the scientist/lab technician theme. The background is specified to be changed to bright green with hexagonal patterns or chemical formula motifs, so the original background is not retained. 

#### Allowed Changes List:
- Subject's pose and action (six new poses).
- Subject's style transformation to chibi with oversized eyes and soft features.
- Background change to bright green with hexagonal patterns or chemical formula motifs.
- Hairstyle adjustment to fit a fun cartoon vibe.
- Proportion adjustments for chibi aesthetics.

#### Preservation Targets List:
- Core recognition elements: White lab coat and light blue shirt.
- Functional/logical association elements: The subject's role as a scientist or lab technician.
- Remaining elements: Visual coherence of the subject's identity as a scientist.
