You are an image editing evaluation expert. Please generate a clear and objective set of "yes/no questions" based on the following input information to check the visual quality of the edited image, with a particular focus on the perceptual quality of the generated image, with a particular emphasis on overall authenticity, natural appearance, and the absence of obvious artifacts. It evaluates whether the output maintains structural coherence and visual plausibility without introducing distortions such as unnatural textures, broken geometric shapes, or degraded fine details. ​
You will receive the following:
Original Image (Image A): Reference Image
Editing instructions (describing how to edit images based on reference images): {Edit instructions}
Please note that you must combine the visual content of the original image (Image A) to clarify all specific positions that need to be edited, assist in understanding and refining editing instructions, ensure that the generated questions are visual, targeted, and reasonable for each position that needs to be edited, and reflect the evaluation of perceived quality.
Your output must be generated strictly according to the following two steps and formats:
Step 1: Disassemble Editing Instructions
Please extract the sub requirements related to perceived quality from the editing instructions, including but not limited to:
Is it possible to affect the overall realism and natural appearance when adding, modifying, replacing, or deleting elements
Can the maintained style, materials, and other features reflect the overall sense of reality and natural appearance
Does the retained core element ensure structural consistency and visual credibility
Whether the proportion and physical rationality of each element avoid distortion such as damaged geometric shapes
Do you want to avoid introducing artifacts such as unnatural textures and loss of details
During the disassembly process, please combine the specific visual content of the original image to obtain specific and accurate sub requirements, reflecting considerations for dimensions related to perceptual quality. ​
The output format is as follows:

```
-<Thinking Process 1>:
-Sub requirement 1
- . ..
```
For example,
-Thinking process 1: If the editing instruction is "Change the red shirt of the character in the original image to blue", combined with the position of the character's shirt and other areas (such as the character's pants, walls in the background, etc.) in the original image, it can be inferred that the editing position is at the character's shirt. This operation involves modifying the color of the shirt, and attention should be paid to whether the color of other areas except the shirt has undergone non directive changes due to editing, and whether the color change of the shirt affects the overall sense of reality and natural appearance. Therefore, the following sub requirements are obtained:
-Sub requirement 1: Modify the elements at the top of the character (change red to blue), whether the color change at this location affects the overall realism and natural appearance, and whether the color of other areas except for the top has not undergone non directive changes.

Step 2: Generate Yes/No Questions
Based on the sub requirements and specific points (including specific editing positions) disassembled in the first step, first explain the thinking process, explain the corresponding sub requirements, specific editing positions, and specific points for each question, and generate a clear and objective set of "yes/no questions". The specific requirements are as follows:
Generate problems for each position that needs to be edited based on perceptual quality dimensions such as overall realism, natural appearance, no obvious artifacts, structural consistency, visual credibility, and no distortion; ​
-Expand the target for each editing position from dimensions such as shape, color, and material to determine whether it has a natural appearance and whether the material is natural and free of artifacts; ​
-For each editing position's action or state class editing, pay attention to whether it is distorted or deformed, whether it conforms to common sense, evaluate structural consistency and visual credibility; ​
-For each editing position's style conversion editing, determine whether the conversion maintains a certain sense of realism without obvious unnatural artifacts; ​
-Determine whether the composition and layout of each editing position's elements have visual credibility; ​
-Each question can be directly judged by observing the specific editing position in the image, without using abstract words, and evaluating the natural appearance through specific phenomena; ​
-Generate rationality check questions for the structural rationality, physical logic, etc. of each editing position, and evaluate visual credibility; ​
-If the position in the image that needs to be edited includes the hand, pay attention to whether the number of fingers on the hand at that position is not more than five, whether the shape, lines, etc. conform to ergonomics, whether there are natural textures and shapes, whether they conform to the natural state, and evaluate structural consistency.

Ideal answer (assuming the edited image is faithful): Yes, each question must be output in the following format (without special symbols, bolding, numbering, or listing symbols):
```
Q1:
Thinking process:
Question:<Question 1>
Choices: Yes, No  
A: <Ideal Answer>

Q2:
Thinking process:
Question:<Question 2>
Choices: Yes, No  
A: <Ideal Answer>
...
```
For example,
Q1:
Thinking process: Based on the sub requirement of "adding and modifying elements at the character's top (changing red to blue), whether editing at this position affects the overall sense of reality and natural appearance", judge whether the color dimension of the editing target at this position has a natural appearance, and evaluate the perceived quality dimension of natural appearance.
Question: Is the blue color on the character's shirt natural without any obvious unnatural color blocks?
Choices: Yes, No
A: Yes

Precautions
-The problem must be semantically clear and can be judged by observing the edited image
-Try not to use subjective evaluation words (such as "beautiful", "good-looking", "realistic", etc.) in the questions
-The default ideal answer is yes (i.e. the ideal answer for perfect editing)
-Do not output content beyond the list and question pairs
-Generate at least 5 questions (adjusted according to the complexity of the image), and the questions shall have no cross overlap
