## Example
{
    instruction:Reimagine the scene as a snow globe design.  \nSetting details: The snow globe rests atop a stone pedestal near a frosty window, offering a view of a snowy mountain range outside. Soft daylight filters through the glass, creating subtle icy reflections and gentle sparkles within the chilly atmosphere.  \nInside the globe: The character takes on a stylized 3D chibi appearance, standing proudly with their shield on a snowy crag. Tiny evergreen trees and miniature mountain peaks surround them, completing the cozy wintery tableau.

{
    instruction:Design a vertically-oriented image inspired by the photo, showcasing a Classic LEGO minifigure-style portrayal of the individual within a small scene. Include a dynamic and athletic animal beside the minifigure, reflecting the individual's composed yet powerful personality, and utilize a coordinated color palette with muted, earthy tones. Surround the scene with a transparent glass cube, featuring minimalist interior elements reminiscent of a sleek studio floor. The base of the miniature should be matte black with silver accents, embodying a clean and contemporary style. Add an elegantly engraved nameplate on the base in a sophisticated serif font, displaying the animal's name, with subtle etching of its biological classification details beneath, similar to exhibits in natural history museums. Use a background with a smooth gradient transitioning from neutral light to soft warm hues, harmonizing with the figure and animal. Ensure the overall composition is well-balanced, with refined lighting enhancing the collectible artwork quality.

{
    instruction:Redesign the sheep and clock in the attached image to appear as part of a scene within a snow globe.  \nScene details: The snow globe rests atop a wooden tabletop, illuminated by gentle, ambient lighting. The background is warm and neutral-toned, creating a cozy atmosphere, with sunlight softly filtering through the globe and casting warm glows on the table and nearby area.  \nInside the globe: The sheep and clock are reimagined as adorable chibi-style 3D models, with the sheep casually leaning against the clock and surrounded by gently drifting snowflakes.

{
    instruction:Design an intricately crafted 3D-rendered collectible figure inspired by the subjects in the image, presented inside a warm, pastel-toned minimalist box. The box features a soft cream hue with delicate gold accents and resembles a refined portable case for tech accessories.\n\nUpon opening, the box unveils a charming diorama focused on desk essentials: chibi-style renditions of the monitor, computer tower, speaker, keyboard, and mouse from the image turned into endearing collectible figures with oversized, sparkling, expressive features. The lid is engraved with the phrase “TECH LIFESTYLE” and adorned with whimsical circuit and gear designs.\n\nInside, the centerpiece is the monitor figure, with the computer tower placed nearby. The speaker and keyboard are positioned on either side to create a balanced layout, while the smaller mouse sits adorably in the front, sporting a playful, animated spark. In the backdrop, a circular window offers a view of a cozy, tech-inspired room bathed in soft, warm lighting to amplify the inviting atmosphere.\n\nBoth the display box and figurines feature an elegant and cohesive color palette, blending cleanliness with modern aesthetics to create a delightful miniature collectible ideal for tech enthusiasts.\n\nAspect ratio: 9:16
