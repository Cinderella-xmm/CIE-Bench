## Example
{
    instruction:Transform the image of the woman in the infinity pool overlooking the dense tropical forest into a magnificent stone carving reminiscent of ancient jungle kingdoms, depicting her as a serene deity with stylized adornments, the pool's water engraved with intricate flowing patterns, and the vibrant jungle reimagined as a relief of sacred plants and mythical guardians, all imbued with the timeworn texture and earthy palette of weathered monumental stone.
}
{
    instruction:Convert the image into an Ancient Egyptian relief carving etched onto a weathered limestone slab, portraying the hatted woman as a revered scribe meticulously preparing a stylus with a device akin to the sharpener, the powerfully built tattooed man as a regal figure observing her, and the distant woman as an attendant, all depicted in traditional profile with muted earth tones and subtle incised details.
