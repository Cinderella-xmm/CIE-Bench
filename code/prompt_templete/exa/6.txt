## Other important Requirements:
The material after replacement cannot be the same or similar to the original material.
## Example
{
    instruction:Replace the sushi rolls with puzzle pieces of varying sizes and colors. Rearrange the puzzles to form the shape of a human figure with the right arm raised. Use larger puzzle pieces for the torso, smaller ones for the limbs, and a rounded cluster for the head. Ensure the arrangement clearly depicts the raised right arm while keeping a balanced composition on the plate.
}
{
    instruction:Recreate the ancient fortress and waterfall scene as a detailed LEGO structure using beige and tan bricks for the walls, with translucent blue and white pieces for the cascading water. Replace the desert terrain with a smooth gray LEGO baseplate, add blocky green brick trees for vegetation, and display the model on a neutral tabletop to emphasize its architectural composition.
}
{
    instruction:Transform the stylish animal wearing a blue hat and sunglasses into a polished enamel figurine. Replace the fur texture with smooth, glossy enamel surfaces in warm caramel and soft blue tones. Keep the hat’s ribbed detail as fine etched lines, turn the sunglasses into reflective metallic enamel, and position the figurine on a white ceramic pedestal to emphasize craftsmanship.
}
{
    instruction:Transform the ornate teapot into a collection of intricately shaped cookies featuring embossed floral patterns inspired by the original engravings. Render the cookies with golden-brown baked textures and slightly darker edges for realism. Arrange them neatly on a simple white ceramic plate placed on the same wooden surface to emphasize their decorative and edible charm.
}
{
    instruction:Transform the breakfast plate into a crystal art composition. Replace sausages, fried egg, and salad with semi-transparent crystal forms—sausages in amber hues, egg white in frosted glass with orange citrine yolk, lettuce and tomatoes in green and ruby-tinted crystal. Arrange all elements in a neat horizontal row on a clear glass plate with subtle etched detailing.
}
{
    instruction:Transform the book into a meticulously crafted object made entirely from layered leaves while preserving the original dragon and compass patterns. Shape the cover from pressed brown and golden leaves, using darker veins to outline the designs. Maintain the embossed detailing by layering leaf fragments for relief texture, and place the leaf-made book on a natural wooden surface for contrast.
}
{
    instruction:Transform the small dog into a plush, furry pillow while preserving its black-and-white color pattern and facial details. Give the pillow a soft, rounded shape with visible fluffy texture resembling faux fur. Keep the eyes embroidered for charm, and place the plush pillow on a neatly made bed with smooth sheets and subtle folds to emphasize coziness.
}
{
    instruction:Envision this vase crafted entirely from vibrant, blossoming flowers. Focus on imaginative design and artistic expression rather than functionality, where the elaborate floral details blend harmoniously with the form of the vase to create a one-of-a-kind interpretation.
