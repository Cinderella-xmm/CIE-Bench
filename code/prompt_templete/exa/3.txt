## Example
{
    instruction:Blend the smaller NXP electronic module and the larger green circuit board into a fantastical cyborg beetle, where the NXP module forms a metallic, multifaceted eye cluster and the green board morphs into a chitinous body with its solder points becoming bioluminescent spots and its traces evolving into delicate, glowing wing veins, poised on the existing neutral background.

{
    instruction:Design a unique creature inspired by this ancient jungle temple, ensuring it feels like it belongs in a fantasy monster-catching universe. Its appearance should reflect the retro aesthetics of Japanese RPG monster art. The image must portray:  \n– A full-body depiction of the creature, drawing from the temple's shape, textures, and mystical ambiance.  \n– A custom-designed orb or capsule at the creature’s feet, featuring patterns and colors that align with the temple's architectural details and natural elements — not resembling a standard Pokéball.  \n– The creature’s invented name displayed beside or beneath it.  \n– Its elemental type (e.g., Earth, Nature, Mystic, Ancient…), reflecting the temple’s core characteristics.  \nThe illustration should resemble a page from a fantasy creature encyclopedia, with precise lines, gentle shading, and a design that evokes wonder and hints at ancient mystery.
}
{
    instruction:Design an original creature inspired by the imagery of a subway train at sunset, making it suitable for a fantasy monster-catching universe. Its appearance should blend urban and celestial motifs, embodying the style of retro Japanese RPG monster designs. The image should include:  \n– A full-body depiction of the creature, incorporating features reminiscent of trains (e.g., streamlined build, lights, tracks) and the warm hues of a sunset.  \n– A custom orb or capsule placed near its feet, decorated with patterns and sunset-inspired colors to match the urban aesthetic — not a typical Pokéball design.  \n– The creature's invented name displayed beside or beneath it.  \n– Its elemental type (e.g., Metal, Fire, Sky, Light…) reflecting the thematic fusion of trains and the sunset.  \nThe artwork should resemble an entry in a fantasy creature encyclopedia, featuring clean linework, soft shading, and a personality-driven design.
}
{
    instruction:Design an original creature inspired by this natural rock formation, tailored to fit seamlessly within a fantasy monster-catching universe. The creature's appearance should incorporate elements such as shape, textures, or patterns influenced by the rocky spire and surrounding environment. The image should include:  \n– A full-body depiction of the creature, showcasing the rugged and earthy vibe of the formation's aesthetic.  \n– A small orb or capsule near its feet, crafted with stone-like textures and grounded, earthy hues that reflect the tranquil surroundings.  \n– An invented name for the creature, displayed alongside or below it.  \n– Its elemental type (Earth, Nature, or Rock), drawn from the geological and environmental characteristics of the setting.  \nThe illustration should emulate a fantasy creature encyclopedia entry, featuring clean outlines, subtle shading, and an expressive, character-driven style.

    instruction:Transform the caracal into a celestial guardian creature with crystalline fur tips and star-like patterns across its body. Add softly glowing runes along its neck, replace the tail with a flowing constellation trail, and modify its eyes to resemble shimmering galaxies with faint orbital rings.
}
{
    instruction:Transform the fleet of airplanes into biomechanical dragon-like creatures with metallic scales and jet engines embedded in their wings. Add glowing blue veins running across their bodies, mechanical eyes with targeting reticles, and replace propellers with energy thrusters emitting geometric plasma trails in the sky.
}
{
    instruction:Transform the German Shepherd into a majestic forest guardian creature with leaf-like fur patterns and glowing amber eyes. Replace its tail with a flowing moss-covered vine, add small antler branches sprouting from its head, give its chest subtle bark-like textures, and adorn its paws with glowing runes.
