## Example
{
    instruction:Reimagine this image as a Renaissance-inspired composition, portraying the horse and elephant with expressive anatomical poses akin to Michelangelo's sculptural works, emphasizing striking lighting and intricately detailed musculature.
}
{
    instruction:Transform the interior view of this modern vehicle, particularly its glowing central touchscreen and the surrounding dark wood paneling, into a spontaneous traditional Chinese expressive ink wash painting, where the screen's interface and airflow graphics dissolve into expressive calligraphic strokes and graded ink washes, while the wood grain texture is suggested with bold, freehand brushwork, capturing the spirit of technological flow through an ancient artistic lens.
}
{
    instruction:Convert the image into a surrealist-style painting by highlighting abstract shapes and bold contrasts—integrate the gold banana as a levitating geometric form, apply liquefying textures to the blue figure, and create a fantastical background with warped components.
}
{
    instruction:Transform the two blonde dolls, the one in the foreground striking a ballet pose with a light colored tutu and the other seated in a pink top on a fuchsia mat, into subjects of a Japanese Ukiyo e woodblock print, characterized by bold calligraphic outlines, flat planes of color for their clothing and hair, and a subtly patterned, simplified background replacing the store environment.
}
{
    instruction:Reinterpret as ukiyo-e mural on a subway wall: flatten the wooden cabin into indigo-outlined planes; render chimney smoke as swirling sumi-ink cloud; swap garlands for repetitive pine emblems; convert surrounding firs to wave-pattern silhouettes; limit palette to indigo, vermilion accents, cream snowpaper texture.
}
{
    instruction:A matte black–framed digital screen sits flush to the façade—slim bezels, anti-glare glass, faint pixel grid, tiny ventilation slots, and concealed mounts keep it monolithic. On it, an ukiyo-e folding-screen mural compresses the valley: triangular peaks, banded lake, pine/maple silhouettes in indigo, vermilion, gold, teal, with bold contours, paper grain, panel seams, and a red seal.
}
{
    instruction:Create an image of a handbag that aligns with the detailed and organic design style of this brain sculpture.
}
{
    instruction:Convert the snowy mountain scene to a brightly colored tropical beach setting, with the skier transformed into someone surfing on vibrant waves.
}
{
    instruction:Transform the stark black bird silhouette resting on the human palm into a lavish Art Nouveau embellishment, with its wings and body detailed by elegant, swirling gold linework and hints of peacock feather iridescence, ensuring the design harmonizes with the palm's delicate creases.
