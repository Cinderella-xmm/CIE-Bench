## Other important Requirements:
1.While preserving the subject’s core features, apply form adjustments through cartoonization, paper-cut effects, or proportion tweaks (e.g., enlarged smiles, refined gestures), and enable **action presets** (e.g., waving, jumping, reading, holding items) with interchangeable poses and expression states. 
2.Convert the adjusted content into packable units, such as single- or multi-card sets, stamps, and small prints, and curate them into carriers such as paper albums, panels, and collector books. Prioritize loading, display, and preservation, treating style changes as carrier-oriented pre-processing.
3.The carrier style should be clearly described, concise, and unambiguous.If there are multiple carriers, please clearly describe each one.

    instruction:Design a handmade postcard series of market scenes: on the front, show cartoon-style men with exaggerated robe patterns and floating motifs, rendered in soft earthy tones to emphasize market textures. Present the postcard realistically, held in one hand as a tangible souvenir.
}
{
    instruction:Convert the scene into a vintage-themed art print framed in dark mahogany: adjust the figure into semi-cartoon style with slightly enlarged facial features for warmth and proportion refined to fit the frame. Replace the lamps with brass candelabras, and embed the subject at a wooden table with an open space on the cloth as a functional writing area. Render the newspaper in sepia tones, style the shelves with ornate motifs, and emboss the tablecloth with geometric patterns to balance elegance with usability.
}
{
    instruction:Create three art postcards held in hand, each showcasing the girl as the main figure in varied scenes: one with her blowing bubbles turned into floating lanterns, one with her dress shifting into layered flower petals, and one with bubbles containing tiny garden landscapes. Print on textured ivory paper with illustrated vine borders and subtle floral corner accents for a collectible postcard set.
}
{
    Convert the scene into a vintage art print framed in dark mahogany: depict the man in cartoon form with an enlarged monocle and refined pose. Age the newspaper with sepia text, replace the lamps with brass candelabras, and emboss the tablecloth with geometric patterns. Simplify the background bookshelves with subtle ornate details, and add a small blank writing panel on the desk for function.
}
{
    instruction:Create a stamp with jagged edges, showing the woman in semi-cartoon paper-cut style, head slightly tilted, hair adorned with blossoms. Turn her open book into layered leaf pages mixing text and foliage. Add a blank box for writing beside her. Place the stamp on an ivory envelope decorated with embossed vines, soft green-lilac washes, and floral corner ornaments.
}
{
    instruction:Reimagine the elderly man with cane and flowers as the centerpiece of a triptych composition: the central panel focuses on his portrait, the left panel transforms his cane’s carved details into winding tree branches, and the right panel expands the flower basket into a blooming garden scene. Enhance his robe with subtle embroidered accents and weave faint cultural calligraphy into the background. Present the entire artwork as a decorative photo stand with polished wooden framing, placed on a tabletop as an elegant display piece.
}
{
    instruction:Design a vineyard art postcard with the elderly man in cartoon form, his smile gently enlarged and posture adjusted to fit the card. Transform his cane into a golden grapevine, highlight his tweed suit with silver-thread accents, and set him amid burgundy-green vineyard rows. Include a grape-cluster blank panel for writing, framed by lavender grape-leaf borders for a lively finish.
}
{
    instruction:Transform the woman in the embroidered robe into two stylized art stickers with cartoon contours and soft watercolor shading: one sticker shows her standing gracefully with a gentle smile, the other depicts her in a playful pose with a brighter expression. Embellish the robe’s floral motifs with gold foil and enhance the colors for striking contrast. Place both stickers on the inside pages of a yellow checkered book, with their figures cleverly interacting with the grid lines as if moving within the pattern.
